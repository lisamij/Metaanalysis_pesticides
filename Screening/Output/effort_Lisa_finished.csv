The components of pesticides, including surfactants, polymers, and active ingredients, were found to influence spray behavior significantly. However, because of both the complexity of interactions in sprayed liquids and the technology limit, only a few specific aspects of the formation of droplets have been studied, and a comprehensive and general understanding is still lacking. This brief review summarizes the effects of surfactants, polymers, and active ingredients on spray and highlights the underlying mechanisms related to sheet breakup and droplet formation. Other factors that warrant detailed exploration in the future are proposed, including dilatational viscoelasticity, zeta potential, aggregation, and sheet thickness. Finally, insights into the design of spray additives for agricultural applications are provided. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",NA,1

To meet this demand, robust analytical methods are essential for confirming the presence and determining active substance concentrations in PPP. This study introduces an analytical method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) for determination of acetamiprid in water-soluble powder formulations. The method, validated according to SANCO/3030/99 rev.5, demonstrated exhibited adequate accuracy and precision, with repeatability expressed as the ratio of the standard deviation (% RSD) to the relative standard deviation (% RSDr) being lower than 1. Recoveries for the active substance at concentrations above 10% ranged from 97% to 103%. The developed method is also characterized by suitable linearity, confirmed by a correlation coefficient >0.99. Specific chromatographic profiles were generated, and acetamiprid content in 180 formulations was analyzed, including reference products. The developed method aligns with ""green chemistry""principles, minimizing solvent use and emphasizing energy efficiency. Overall, it offers a comprehensive approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis, ensuring the reliability of PPP quality control. © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,2

With the increase in microbial resistance to single-chain surfactant antimicrobial agents, it is crucial to investigate how surfactant structures affect the antimicrobial activity of surfactants. Here, we have studied the antimold efficacy of a series of oligomeric cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants at varying oligomerization levels with or without dynamic covalent imine bonds. Four common molds are chosen as representatives: A. niger, T. viride, C. globosum, and P. funiculosum. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) results indicate that the dynamic covalent surfactants in solution display stronger antimold activity than the surfactants of the same oligomerization degree without imine bonds, and the antimold activity decreases as the oligomerization degree increases. The superior fungicidal efficacy of imine-based surfactants in solution is attributed to their longer hydrophobic chains and benzene rings, which enhance the interactions with mold membranes, causing perforation and membrane disruption. Nonetheless, the higher oligomerization degree reduces antimold effectiveness due to the formation of overly stable aggregates, which lower the concentration of free molecular monomers released from aggregates and may accumulate on mold spore membranes. However, on fabric surfaces, the surfactants with a higher oligomerization degree show stronger antimold performance. The multiple hydrophobic chains and cationic headgroups result in greater surfactant adsorption and stronger antimildew activity. Moreover, the reversibility of the imine-based surfactants plays a significant role in reducing the likelihood of resistance. This work is helpful to construct antimicrobial agents with broad-spectrum activity and a weak resistance potential. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",NA,3

Currently, at least 25 active ingredients are being employed as biocides in antifouling paint formulations. In the present study, silicone rubber-based passive sampling was used to determine the freely dissolved concentrations (Cw) of 6 OTs and 4 booster biocides in the water column at the entrance of Santos Port's main navigation channel, the largest Port of South America (southeastern Brazil). Fifteen sampling events of ∼45 days long were conducted over 2 years. Cw of OTs ranged from 1.1 to 2.5 ng Sn L−1 for monobutyltin (MBT), 0.2 to 4.7 ng Sn L−1 for dibutyltin (DBT), and 0.06 to 0.7 ng Sn L−1 for tributyltin (TBT), while triphenyltin (TPhT), diphenyltin (DPhT), and monophenyltin (MPhT) were always below their limits of detection (<LOD). For booster biocides, Cw ranged from 3.9 to 6.3 ng L−1 for diuron, 0.03 to 0.49 ng L−1 for Irgarol, <0.55 to 44.3 ng L−1 for DCOIT, and <0.01 to <0.02 ng L−1 for dichlofluanid. Levels found in the water column are likely explained by a combination of sources, including simultaneous releases from marinas and shipyards located in adjacent areas, dredging operations, intense vessel traffic in the Santos Port, and desorption from APPs previously released along sediments of the Santos-São Vicente Estuarine System (SSES). Although OTs and booster biocide levels in the Port of Santos were relatively lower than in other studies worldwide, levels detected for TBT, DCOIT, and diuron pose a risk to non-target organisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,4
5,Lisa,NO,Nendza M.; Kosfeld V.; Schlechtriem C.,Consolidated octanol/water partition coefficients: combining multiple estimates from different methods to reduce uncertainties in log KOW,2025,Environmental Sciences Europe,37,NA,NA,10.1186/s12302-025-01072-2,"Background: The octanol/water partition coefficient (KOW) is a key parameter for assessing the fate and effects of chemicals. It is a metric of their hydrophobicity, related to uptake and accumulation in organisms and specific tissues, and distribution in water, soil and sediments. The log KOW can be determined experimentally, more often it is calculated. Variability may be due to properties of the substances, different experimental methods, or different computational approaches with different domains of applicability. The objective of the present study is to derive coherent log KOW estimates with known variability by (1) estimating multiple log KOW values by different methods for diverse chemicals to exemplify their variabilities, (2) analysing the variabilities of log KOW estimates by underlying methods and for different chemical classes, and (3) recommending approaches to obtain reliable and robust log KOW estimates for hazard and risk assessment. Results: Comparative analyses were based on 231 case study chemicals representing diverse chemical classes, such as POPs, PCB, PAH, siloxanes, flame retardants, PFAS, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, etc. The variability of up to 36 log KOW values per substance, determined experimentally or estimated by different computational approaches, is 1 log unit and more across the entire log KOW range from <0 to >8. No systematic pattern is evident. Different methods for deriving log KOW perform sometimes better and sometimes worse for different chemicals. None of the methods (experimental or computational) is consistently superior and any method can be the worst. Conclusions: Iterative consensus modelling combines multiple estimates by a weight-of-evidence (WoE) or averaging approach for scientifically valid and reproducible log KOW estimates with known variability. Consolidated log KOW, being the mean of at least 5 valid data obtained by different independent methods (experimental and computational), are a pragmatic way to deal with the variability and uncertainty of individual results. While this approach does not solve any of the problems about “correctly” determining log KOW, it does limit the bias due to individual erroneous estimates. Consolidated log KOW are robust and reliable measures of hydrophobicity, with variability mostly within 0.2 log units. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,5

Active components were separated chromatographically from additives and co-formulations using isocratic elution with 0.1 % orthophosphoric acid and acetonitrile in a 30:70 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL per min on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (250 × 4.6 mm; 3.5 µm) with UV detection at 190 nm. With a 20-minute run time, the retention times for thiamethoxam, thiophanate-methyl, azoxystrobin, fipronil, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, and tolfenpyrad were found to be 2.96, 3.68, 5.98, 8.39, 11.31, 13.74, and 16.38 min, respectively. SANCO guidelines for precision, linearity, robustness, accuracy, LOD, specificity and selectivity were followed to approve the efficiency of this technique. Because all analyses were conducted using a single method and constant chromatographic settings, the suggested method offers several advantages, including rapid, sustainable, and eco-friendly analysis, as well as overall low costs. Developed method can be applied to water, food and different sources samples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,6

Several species, including the horn-faced bee (Osmia cornifrons) and the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria), are commercially managed, primarily for the pollination of fruit trees and tree nuts. They are efficient pollinators and have high pollen fidelity, and so can greatly benefit orchard yields compared to honey bees (Apis mellifera) alone. Apis mellifera are often used as surrogates for other pollinators during pesticide risk assessment. Non-Apis bee species, however, can be more sensitive to certain pesticides, so it is also important to research the impact of novel pesticides on other bee species. This study investigated the effect of two formulated pesticide products containing recently approved active ingredients, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone, on the survival of A. mellifera and three species of mason bees (O. lignaria, O. cornifrons, and Osmia californica). Bees were orally exposed to sulfoxaflor or flupyradifurone and their survival was measured over four days following exposure. Bee sensitivity to the insecticides varied by species and sex of bee. Apis mellifera was the least sensitive, followed by O. cornifrons, with O. lignaria and O. californica as the most sensitive. Male Osmia spp. bees were less sensitive than females. These insecticides may pose a higher risk to the health of Osmia spp. compared to A. mellifera. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",NA,7

Control measures frequently rely on spraying contact insecticides, which often are inadequate. To provide insights for utilizing baits for their control, TCA foraging behavior was examined on liquid ant bait formulations that contained either fast-acting dinotefuran or slow-acting disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT), and the impacts of these baits were assessed. Bayesian modeling of counts from time-lapse photography of TCA feeding on the baits and a control of sucrose solution in the field revealed strong evidence of similar foraging intensities between the control and the DOT bait and less foraging intensity on the dinotefuran bait. TCA abundance on the dinotefuran bait peaked within 8 h, then diminished to smaller feeding bouts over the 3-day study. In contrast, foraging on the DOT and control remained consistently high before bait depletion. The impact of the fast and slow-acting baits in field plots were based on TCA nest sizes and TCA abundance on sausage lures. Bayesian modeling predictions revealed nest sizes declined over the 2 months with bait present while the control had large nests. Abundance on the lures in the dinotefuran plots declined from the start of the study, while with the slow-acting DOT bait, declines in abundance were not lower than the control plot until 30 days after baiting was initiated. Further refinements in baiting with liquid baits containing fast and slow acting active ingredients may provide fast and sustained control of TCA. © 2025 Oxford University Press.

The nanocapsule exhibited better storing stability, anti-photolysis property, foliar wettability, and retention, as compared to the conventional concentrated emulsion of EB (EB-EC). Incorporation into the nanocapsule retarded the release of EB, which was pH-sensitive and dependent on the structure of the nanocapsule. A better sustaining effect could be achieved by an increase of SA or a reduction of CTAB and in a basic environment, due to the enhanced interaction between the active ingredient and the shell matrix of the nanocapsule. The incorporation into the nanocapsule greatly increased the activity of EB. The median lethal concentration of typical positively charged nanocapsule EB@SA0.1CTAB0.4Tw0.2 against Mythimna separata larvae was 48% of that of commercial EB-EC, after feeding to the insect for 48 h. The result indicated that the self-assembling of SA and CTAB was a good strategy to fabricate instant nanoformulation under mild conditions and with high efficiency and low cost, which was valuable to prompt nanopesticides from laboratory investigation to field application. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",NA,9

Additionally, an increasing population generates pressure to escalate crop production to meet global demand. Agrochemicals hence are widely used in agriculture to enhance production; however, their excessive employment damages the habitat. In this perspective, nanotechnology, especially polymer matrix-based nanocomposites, has become a notable domain in the agricultural sector that counters climatic changes, soil fertility, nutrient deficiency, and overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Nanoencapsulation processes not only safeguard the active ingredient but also can affect diffusion, interaction, and activity. Polymer nanomaterials have exclusive characteristics along with controlled release and stability, superior biocompatibility, and less impact on nontargeted organisms. They are also utilized for nanoherbicide formulations. Polymeric nanoparticles can robustly adhere to the cell wall due to electrostatic interactions and can invade the root tissue and stomata in leaves and can be transported by apoplastic and symplastic pathways. Exertion of these nanoformulations tends to reduce the negative impacts that herbicides and insecticides pose on the environment and hence act as nanocarriers, boosting the selectivity of pesticides. Remarkably, organs like flowers, fruits, and seeds normally have a strong capability to import and accumulate nanomaterials. Hence, seed coating of such nanomaterials offers protection to the seeds at initial stages of development, as it changes metabolism by improving germination and early seedling growth and also has long-term effects on plant development with higher productivity. This chapter focuses on the application of various polymer-based nanomaterials for sustainable farming as a nontoxic system, their uptake efficiency, interaction with plants, and how they might influence future developments in agriculture. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Mary Theresa, Ashitha Jose, Jyotishkumar Parameswaranpillai, Radhakrishnan E K; individual chapters, the contributors.",NA,10

The application of traditional agrochemicals in the agriculture sector has wide-ranging consequences on both organisms and the environment. Prospects in formulating nanoemulsions used as nano delivery systems for agrochemicals in fields, crop protection, and farm animal management by improving animal and plant efficiency in agriculture. This review places emphasis on bio nanoemulsion formulation for different agricultural applications such as pesticides, fungicides, acaricides, insect and tick repellents, herbicides, and nematicides, which reduce toxicity and, in turn, improve environmental sustainability. Overall, nanoemulsion paves the way to more efficient, eco-friendly and reliable implementation in agronomics. The targeted active substance is advantageous using a method of nanoemulsion due to their unique size to surface area ratio. This allows better penetration through plant cuticles and insect agrochemicals. The controlled release mechanisms inherent in nanoemulsion systems can minimize the environmental impact of agrochemicals. By allowing for targeted application at lower dosages, nanoemulsions protect active ingredients from disintegration due to factors such as light and heat fluctuations. This stability ensures that the agrochemicals remain effective over longer periods, enhancing their usability in various agricultural settings. © 2025 Mahendrapublications.com, All rights reserved.",NA,11

The results showed that the active ingredient decreased by 18.15% after 14 weeks of storage at 54 °C. However, the decline within the same time period ranged between 5-10% at 35, 40, and 45 °C, respectively. Thus, hexythiazox storage complied with FAO specification after more than 14 weeks at 35°C and not after more than 9, 8, and 4 weeks at 40, 45, and 54°C, respectively. The data showed that the degradation rate of hexythiazox was dependent on its initial concentration and increased progressively as temperature increased. Furthermore, the shelf life of hexythiazox after storage at 54°C was found to be approximately 1/5 that of its shelf life after storage at 35°C. The kinetics of hexythiazox degradation under the studied conditions followed the first-order model, being dependent upon its initial concentration. The shelf life (t0.95) and half-life (t1/2) of hexythiazox in forced alkaline solutions were less than those in acidic solutions. The results revealed that hexythiazox is a non-persistent pesticide in soil; it decomposed rapidly in Egyptian clay-loam soil, with an 80.53% reduction in 14 days at ambient conditions and a half-life (t1/2) of 5.75 days. This is due to soil pH (8.59), organic matter (1.92), and the molecular structure of hexythiazox, which contains chromophores such as ethylene and carbonyl groups; it may be sensitive to direct photolysis by sunlight because it absorbs wavelengths longer than 290 nm. According to the GC/MS analysis, hexythiazox was degraded to different byproducts after specified conditions. The benzene and cyclohexane rings remain stable under different applied conditions; however, the thiazolidine ring is cleaved and opened during thermal and forced acidic hydrolysis and remains stable after alkaline hydrolysis and soil photolysis. The contraction reaction is unique to the forced alkaline hydrolysis and photolysis of hexythiazox in clay-loam soil; thus, two products were identified: 4-chloro-2-(cyclohexanecarboxamido) benzoic acid and 3-cyclohexyl-1-methyl-1-(2-phenylethyl) urea; the latter one and 4-methyl-5-phenylthiazolidine-2-one were identified in the forced alkaline hydrolysis of hexythiazox. ©2025 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).",NA,12

(Diptera: Muscidae), are commonplace pests in both urban and agricultural settings. The potential for house flies as vectors of many disease-causing organisms to humans and animals, coupled with their incessant nuisance behaviors toward these hosts has resulted in a desire to manage their populations. Although many house fly management tools are available, insecticide use continues to predominate as the preferred choice. One such option, insecticidal baits, is commercially available in a variety of active ingredients that encompass several modes of action. Though they can be effective, resistance to many of the active ingredients used in bait formulations has been documented. The primary pathway for resistance evolution to bait products likely has been selection at the targeted adult stage. However, exposure at the larval stage may occur when these products are scattered on substrates, contaminating sub-surface developmental areas and ultimately, playing a selective role as well. A study was conducted to assess the potential mortality effects of insecticidal bait products on house fly larval development when applied according to the manufacturer’s recommended label rate. Adult house fly emergence was reduced by nearly 40% due to treatment, supporting the implication that bait-driven mortality during larval development may represent a previously unrecognized selection pathway contributing to resistance evolution against these products. © 2025 Oxford University Press.

The research aims to address the inherent challenges of essential oils, particularly their high volatility and rapid degradation, by improving their stability and insecticidal efficiency against the grain pest Sitophilus granarius. By anchoring EOCL onto clay matrices, this study seeks to achieve a sustained and controlled release of the active components, thereby enhancing their practical application as biopesticides. The clays were comprehensively characterized using advanced analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques revealed the mineralogical composition, thermal properties, and morphology of the clays, demonstrating their suitability for effectively adsorbing and retaining EOCL. The insecticidal performance of the clay/EOCL composites was thoroughly tested under controlled conditions, revealing a marked improvement in efficacy, with significantly lower lethal doses required to achieve high mortality rates in Sitophilus granarius. The diffusion of EOCL through the clay matrix was modeled using Fick’s law of diffusion, and the results were further refined through statistical optimization to identify key parameters that influence the release and effectiveness of the active compounds. Complementing the experimental approach, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted to explore the molecular interactions between limonene, the primary active component of EOCL, and target proteins in insects. This theoretical investigation provided insights into the potential mechanisms of action, reinforcing the empirical findings. This study concludes that encapsulating EOCL within porous clay matrices not only enhances the stability and controlled release of the oil but also significantly boosts its insecticidal effectiveness. This approach presents a promising, environmentally sustainable strategy for crop protection, integrating material science, theoretical modeling, and bioinformatics to develop more efficient and durable biopesticides. © 2025 by the authors.",NA,14

Despite the efforts of regulatory agencies, there still is a lack of information regarding short- and long-term exposures to soil-dwellers, as well as effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT® and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00–1.49 mg of the active ingredient·kg−1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT® at ≥0.66 mg kg−1 and SPIN at ≥0.13 mg kg−1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT® at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg−1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT® and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT® and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT® on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT® and SPIN. The results suggest that spinosyns-based products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors",NA,15

The antimicrobial potential of essential oils (EOs) derived from Allium sativum (garlic) and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon) can be significantly enhanced through the application of nanotechnology. In this study, we encapsulated the EOs of A. sativum and C. verum in silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which resulted in increased fungicidal activity against Botrytis cinerea, the pathogen responsible for anthracnose in many horticultural crops. The encapsulated EOs demonstrated a synergistic effect, achieving over 80 % inhibition of B. cinerea mycelium growth and suppressing conidia germination by 75 %. Furthermore, substantial morphological changes in the fungal hyphae were observed upon application of the nano-encapsulated EOs. The observed morphological changes included disrupted cell walls and deformed hyphal structures, which indicated severe damage to the fungal cells. The AgNPs function as carriers, enhancing the stability and dispersion of EOs and facilitating a more uniform and sustained release of the active compounds. The results of this study indicate that nano-encapsulated EOs have the potential to be effective antifungal agents, offering a promising approach for pathogen control in agriculture. The integration of nanotechnology with traditional antimicrobial agents enables the development of advanced formulations that provide enhanced protection against a wide range of plant pathogens.

Its distinctive attributes, including UV absorbance, biodegradability, high aromaticity, and environmental friendliness, make it a significant element in the formulation of agrochemicals and advanced agricultural products. This review explores recent progress in lignin valorization, emphasizing its role in enhancing soil health, plant growth, and crop protection. Notably, lignin-based slow-release fertilizers have demonstrated a release rate of 60–75% throughout various time intervals. Moreover, during seed encrusting, the application of the coating increased seed weight ranging from 8% to 500%. Furthermore, the integration of cellulose and lignin into polylactic acid (PLA) film coatings has increased the tensile strength and modulus by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively, which is advantageous for preventing seed deterioration. Additionally, lignin-coated fertilizers and seed treatments improved nutrient retention, water efficiency, and crop yields while reducing soil and water contamination.

In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the research papers based on the acaricidal activity of plant extracts. A meta-analysis was conducted with an aim to highlight the potential candidates for further research for the development of ecofriendly and sustainable anti-tick herbal formulations. A total of 52 papers were analyzed up until December 2023, sourced from extensive searches of databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar, focusing on the acaricidal activity of various plants against tick species. The plants belonging to Annonaceae and Burseraceae families were found significantly effective against ticks. Amongst the tick species, Rhipicephalus microplus was the highly studied tick species followed by Haemaphysalis bispinosa and Hyalomma dromedarii. The most responsive tick species to plant extracts were Hyalomma dromedarii and Ambylomma cajannense. With respect to the parts of the plants used, leaf (45%) was extensively utilized while the extracts prepared from the resin, stem and fruit peel of the plant showed highest acaricidal activity. The present study highlighted significant variability in the effectiveness of plant extracts depending on the plant species, plant parts used, type of extractant, and the tick species tested. These findings emphasize the need to develop a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for evaluating phytocompounds. Future research should prioritize isolating active compounds, elucidating their mechanisms of action, and optimizing formulations to ensure sustainable and effective tick management strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,18

The practical application of dimethomorph (DIM) is hindered by its hydrophobic nature, posing risks to nontarget organisms. Inspired by the uptake of nanomaterials by plants, DIM was encapsulated in the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity to optimize its water-solubility and the sustained-release rate. The spatial confinement effect of CD could facilitate the thermostability of DIM. DIM/CD inclusion complex solutions were electrospun to fabricate nanofibers with bead-free and smooth morphology. As predicted, the release of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers reached plateaus with accumulative release values of approximately 75%. The antifungal activity of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers possesses much higher than DIM for controlling Rhizoctonia solani and Haematonectria hematococco, thereby enhancing its antifungal bioactivity and reducing pesticide spraying frequency. The inhibition rates of Rhizoctonia solani by DIM/HPβCD and DIM/HPγCD inclusion complex nanofibers are found to be 55.8% and 53.6% within 144 h, respectively.

Traditional Chinese medicine extract wettable powder was prepared by directly mixing the raw materials, carriers, and additives, followed by grinding and sieving. Types of carriers, dispersants, wetting agents, the ratio of dispersant to wetting agent, and the amount of additives were examined as factors in the optimization of the preparation process for the wettable powder using the orthogonal experimental design method, based on the single-factor experiment. When the carrier is bentonite, the dispersant is calcium lignosulfonate, the wetting agent is tide laundry detergent, the ratio of dispersant to wetting agent is 1: 9, the amount of additives added is 15 %, the comprehensive score of the prepared wettable powder is the highest, being up to 80.64 %, the quality inspection meets the general requirements.

Wacapou (Vouacapoua americana., Fabaceae) is a well-known Guianese wood species commonly used in local wood construction due to its outstanding natural durability, which results from the presence of a large panel of extractives compounds. In addition, its industrial processing generates large amounts of residues. Wacapou residues were extracted by maceration using four different solvents (water/ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane and dichloromethane/methanol), separately and successively. The yield of each extractive fraction was determined, and their chemical compositions were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Ethyl acetate led to the highest extraction yield, and the active compounds were identified in the obtained extractive fraction. In this sense, the fungicidal and termite-repellent properties of these extractives were then tested using a screening laboratory (with temperate and tropical microorganisms), according to the solution concentration (1%, 2.5%, 5%, 8% and 10%). Finally, Virola michelii Heckel wood samples (low durable species) were impregnated with the 8% concentration solution. The impregnated wood samples were then exposed to a soil bed test. The results highlighted that the nature of the solvent used during wood maceration affects the content of the obtained extractive fractions. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography–High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) analyses showed the influence of extraction parameters on the nature of the extracted molecules. Wacapou extracts (from ethyl acetate maceration) showed good anti-fungal and anti-termite activities. Additionally, the concentration in extractives had an impact on the anti-termite activity level for Reti-culitermes flavipes and Cryptotermes sp. Formulations based on Wacapou extractives showed a good potential for valorization in eco-friendly preservatives, aiming to confer better durability to local low-durability wood species. © 2025 The Authors.",NA,21

Apple, grape, ginger, rice, and other plant stem cells have been successfully and extensively utilized in cosmetic preparations all over the world. The advantages of plant cell suspensions over field-grown complete plants, which exhibit developmental stages of growth, plant age, and organ-specific differences, include sustainability, lack of pesticide residues, and independence from climate fluctuations. The procedure of extracting and purifying physiologically active compounds from plant cell cultures is significantly streamlined because of the possibility that these chemicals may be released into the intercellular gaps or wasted media through the cell walls and membrane. Upon downstream processing from the cells, the released chemicals exhibit minimal losses and a high degree of purity. Overall, the practical interest is in creating high-quality, sustainable, and innovative skincare solutions that meet both consumer needs and environmental concerns while driving the cosmetic industry toward more advanced biotechnological approaches.

Renowned for its antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, pesticide, and insecticidal properties, NO is a highly effective and eco-friendly alternative to synthetic chemicals in agricultural, food, and medical applications. The interfacial properties of NO were assessed by measuring its effect as an additive on the formulation of microemulsions (MEs) and nanoemulsions (NEs). Formulation scans were employed to evaluate the effect of NO on surfactant-oil-water (SOW) systems under optimum formulation conditions. The results indicate that adding NO to the oil phase shifts the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value, at optimum formulation, from 9.5 to 11.5, suggesting that the additive contributes to the emulsification of the oil phase. Maltese cross patterns were observed on polarized light micrographs taken from the ME containing NO, indicating the presence of lamellar liquid crystals (LCs). NEs generated by a low-energy emulsification method displayed droplet size significantly lower droplet sizes (11–22 ± 1) nm than those obtained by high-energy methods. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the hydrophilic nature of azadirachtin, the key bioactive component of NO, at the water/n-decane interface, providing molecular evidence of its interfacial behavior.

Leaching of the studied herbicides was influenced by pH of the soil and herbicides leached more readily in alkaline soils than in acidic soil. Among alkaline soils, leaching was positively correlated with OM content of the soil. Addition of surfactant increased the leaching of herbicides and their TPs, resulting in lower residues in the upper layers and higher residues in the lower layers and leachates indicating greater potential for deeper soil contamination. Additionally, breakthrough curves for iodosulfuron methyl appeared earlier when the soil columns were treated with commercial formulation in the presence of surfactant. Among the different TPs, mesosulfuron (M1) and 2-[3-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl) ureidosulfonyl]−4-methane sulfonamidomethyl benzoate (M2) TPs of mesosulfuron methyl and metsulfuron methyl (I1) and (methyl-2-(amino-sulfonyl) benzoate (I2) TPs of iodosulfuron methyl were detected. M2 has the highest mobility followed by M1 and I1 suggesting higher risk of M2 to contaminate lower soil profiles and groundwater thereby posing long-term ecological and human health risks.

Neem oil and rhamnolipid biosurfactant were utilized as the base oil and surfactant, respectively for the NE formulation. Initial screening studies with varying oil-to-surfactant ratios identified an optimal ratio of 7.13 (w/w), corresponding to 15% oil (v/v) of total emulsion volume, for a stable NE. The stability of the formulation was validated in a 25 mL volume over 20 days, maintaining a mean droplet diameter of 139.1 ± 7.34 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.207. Further stability assessments under varying time, temperature, ionic strengths, and centrifugal forces revealed a relatively stable droplet diameter ranging from 141 to 245 nm. The surface tension for the optimal formulation was measured to be 35.7 ± 0.4 mN m−1. Additionally, experiments with various NE formulations on selected leaves showed that NEs with higher oil content displayed faster spreading, as indicated by a rapid reduction in contact angle. The novelty of the study lies in demonstrating the synergistic interaction between oil and rhamnolipid, which facilitated faster spreading compared to the individual spreading of either component, as revealed by the dynamic spreading studies of the NE formulation on leaf surfaces. Therefore, this research paves the way for future research and development of green pesticides that are sustainable and effective compared to their chemical counterparts. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",NA,25

This study assessed the toxicological effects of the commercial fungicide formulations Fantic FNCWG® and Ramedit combi®, both individually and in combination, on honeybees. Using a multi-biomarker approach, we evaluated neurotoxicity, metabolic disturbances, phase II detoxification processes, and immune system function. Our findings revealed that commercial fungicide mixtures with multiple active ingredients affect bees differently than single active compounds. Biomarker responses highlighted how these complex mixtures disrupt various enzymatic pathways; including immune function; altering critical enzyme kinetics involved in detoxification and potentially impairing essential bee functions.

Here, five different classes of insecticides (i.e., dinotefuran, fipronil, hydramethylnon, indoxacarb, and etofenprox) were dispersed in water, PEG, and PLE, and their lung inflammation potential was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis 24 h after intratracheal instillation into the lungs of rats. All chemicals dispersed in water caused no inflammation. However, among the five chemicals dispersed in PEG and PLE, only hydramethylnon showed significant neutrophilic inflammation and hydramethylnon in PEG showed 4-fold higher inflammogenic potential than that in PLE. The in vitro cytotoxic potential of hydramethylnon in PEG was 10–17 fold (in A549) or 12–14 fold (in dTHP-1) higher than that of hydramethylnon in PLE, and greater than 370 fold (in A549) or 65–169 fold (in dTHP-1) higher than that in water. PEG toxicity increased due to the micellar formulation of hydramethylnon in PEG, increasing cellular uptake by simple diffusion.

The concentration data were first made comparable through an original process removing the bias induced by the space-and-time heterogeneity of the monitoring labs performance, to gather a reference workable set of monthly contamination indicators. These were then used to display the substances’ seasonal and interannual timeseries, revealing, e.g. the succession of PPP active substances contamination peaking periods in the 6 basins, or the long-term trends of the concentrations of the various chemicals, sometimes evidencing insufficiencies in the monitoring performance. These environmental observations were put in regard of the knowledge of the substances ban, restriction or reduction measures, to assess how streams’ chemical quality responds to them. Additionally, the observed contamination features and their variations over the years are discussed in terms of changes in their usages, product substitution, emission sources, and linked to environmental processes like runoff, river dilution and physicochemical conditions. Some original findings and interpretation are provided on glyphosate and AMPA wide-scale data inter-relation, and some light is cast on the efficacy of the recent national policies restricting pesticides use in populated areas. For PPPs, the developed water contamination indicators were compared to tonnage data. We assessed their degree of linear relationship, which we propose to quantitatively express through a substance specific basin-to-river contamination coefficient. The interannual variations of this coefficient appear to be related to the changes in the water contamination seasonal patterns. We were also able to describe and validate the dependency of this coefficient on the molecular properties of the substances, conferring some capabilities for predicting the relative environmental risk induced by non-yet monitored compounds.

Here we investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan®SG (active ingredient acetamiprid) on plant bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae), a dominant group of European grassland insect communities. In a controlled field study, the abundance of three focal species was reduced by up to 92% two days after field exposure at concentrations expected at field margins, with mortality varying among species. Follow-up feeding assays with insecticide-treated host plants in the greenhouse and controlled dose-response laboratory assays confirmed the strong negative effects on non-target species. Strikingly, when comparing the lethal dose 50 derived from Mospilan®SG with a value reported for honeybees using another acetamiprid formulation, the insecticide was over 11,000 times more toxic to plant bugs than to honeybees. In addition, males were 20 times more sensitive than females in the two tested species. Thus, continuous exposure to this neonicotinoid may reduce plant bug populations and promote insecticide-tolerant species, altering community composition. We suggest that sex-specific sensitivity be considered in risk assessment and conclude that the true risk to non-target insects is currently greatly underestimated. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,29

Despite extensive studies, the safety of GSH remains debatable. This study aimed to determine if occupational exposure to GSH causes detectable changes in renal injury biomarkers—specifically DNA methylation, KIM-1, TIMP2, and IGFBP7—in farmers regularly exposed to these chemicals. Two urine samples, pre-task (0-h) and post-task (24-h), were collected to analyze these biomarkers. No significant immediate changes were observed post-exposure, possibly due to personal protective equipment use. Moderate positive correlations were found between IGFBP7 and KIM-1, and IGFBP7 and TIMP2, suggesting early kidney injury. About 50% of subjects had a biomarker ratio greater than 1, indicating increased levels of IGFBP7, TIMP2, and KIM-1 after GSH exposure. This indicates that farmers who regularly spray GSH are at high risk of exposure, potentially leading to significant renal injury.

Certain analytical techniques were used for determining the characterization of the nano emulsions (Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon). Results showed that all formulations were penal, achieving nanometric size for all compounds. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed spherical or quasi-spherical morphologies for the tested nanoemulsion formulation nanodroplets. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the particle size of the formulation with the adjuvants showed a slight increase in the droplet size compared to the formulations without adjuvants. In comparison to the tested nanoemulsions with adjuvants, the viscosity of the nanoemulsions without adjuvants was lower. All studied formulations, both with and without adjuvant, showed an acidic to slightly acidic pH, except for sesame (NE) with AtloxTM 4838B, which showed a neutral pH, and they were kinetically stable with no phase separation, creaming, or crystallization. Furthermore, supporting the stability of these nanoemulsion particles was the absence of a separation phase following centrifugation, freeze–thaw cycles, and heating–cooling cycles. Findings proved that ARGAL and Atlox 4838B adjuvant stabilized NE by increasing Brownian motion, weakening the attractive forces with smaller droplets, increasing the value of zeta potential and polydispersive index (< 0.6), and decreasing surface tension. The bioassay technique using film residue to estimate LC50 values on S. oryzae adults indicate that Clove, Sesame, and Cinnamon nano emulsions with Atolx adjuvants were the most effective against S. oryzae adults under laboratory conditions, where the LC50 Values are 0.022, 0.032 and 0.035 µL/cm2 respectively after 27 h, or exposure time.

Bayesian Additive Regression Trees – BART method indicated that Log Pow and molecular weight have the highest importance when predicting dermal absorption; both parameters exhibit moderate interaction uncertainty within each other and with formulation groups water-based and organic-solvent based and with tested form (concentrates or dilutions). The default values for each formulation group were determined using the upper bound of a non-parametric confidence interval for a specified quantile, with calculations conducted via bootstrapping methods; the proposed values correspond to the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 95th percentile: for concentrates, 10% for organic-solvent based, 4% for water-based and 3% for solid formulations. For dilutions, 42% for organic-solvent based, 37% for water-based and 39% for solid formulations. Organic-solvent based dermal absorption values from experimental data can be used as conservative surrogates for solid and water-based formulations. When no experimental data is available for higher spray dilutions of a given formulation type, a pro-rated correction is proposed to a 2 to 5-fold concentration difference, limited to the respective formulation group default value. © 2025 The Authors",NA,32

The S2 niosome variant performed effective inhibitory activity against the all three species of mosquito with LC50 value was 19.05 ppm for Ae. aegypti, 16.12 ppm for An. stephensi, and 17.42 ppm against Cx. quinquefasciatus. The elevated activity might be due to the presence of α-pinene compound present in the lemon oil. Thus, the study concludes that lemon oil-mediated niosomes are a potent larvicide and can be further developed into insecticides in the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",NA,35

The intense use of synthetic acaricides to manage tick infestations resulted in widespread acaricide resistance in the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, which is known to infest over 75% of the farms where cattle are raised in the country. Sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to control the cattle tick R. microplus are needed urgently. This minireview describes a project at the Santo Domingo Experimental Station of the National Institute of Agricultural Research to develop biopesticides for tick management to exemplify advances in collaborative research on the use of entomopathogenic fungi as active ingredients, or mycopesticides, in formulations to control R. microplus. Research and development conducted in multiple phases revealed the in vitro and in vivo acaricidal properties of B. bassiana sensu lato (s.l.) strain INIAP L3B3. These efforts followed efficacy and safety norms issued by the government agency of Ecuador in charge of controls and regulations to protect an improve animal health, plant health, and food safety. Results described herein indicate that B. bassiana s.l. INIAP L3B3 can be registered as an eco-friendly mycopesticide alternative to synthetic chemical acaricides or could complement conventional chemical acaricide applications for integrated R. microplus management programs in support of sustainable cattle raising in Ecuador.

In this paper, the effect of droplet charge density on stabilization of the n-decane-in-water OID emulsion was examined by using a cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)/C12B (dodecyl dimethyl carboxyl betaine) binary mixture at a low fixed total concentration (0.01 mM) with varying molar fractions of CTAB. A model based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory is proposed to calculate interaction energies between droplets and between droplets and particles. It is found that the droplet charge density can be well compensated by particle concentration along the stabilization boundary, and the OID emulsion still follows the DLVO stabilization. Particles tend to surround droplets at large distances but may form a monolayer between approaching droplets at shorter distances, which significantly reduces the van der Waals attraction between droplets. In addition, the induced auxiliary droplet–particle repulsion is proportional to the number of particles per unit area of droplet surfaces, which together with the droplet–droplet repulsion ensures a large total repulsion preventing droplets from flocculation and coalescence. This work explains quantitatively the stabilization of OID emulsions, which have potential applications in emulsion products such as foods, cosmetics, pesticides, and various industrial emulsion systems. Moreover, the development of the OID emulsions represents an important advancement in green chemistry as it substantially reduces the required amounts of emulsifiers and their environmental impact after use. © 2024 AOCS.",NA,37

Essential oils extracted from O. vulgare leaves cultivated in Germany, Albania, and Iran were analyzed. Among them, the German oil exhibited the highest acaricidal potency due to its elevated carvacrol content (83.38%). Carvacrol was isolated and its identity was confirmed using GC/MS, NMR, and FT-IR analyses. Carvacrol demonstrated significant toxicity across all developmental stages of H. longicornis, with LC50 values of 3.47, 8.21, and 15.27 μg/cm3 for larvae, nymphs, and adults, respectively—representing 4.4-, 3.5-, and 3.2-fold higher potency compared to diethyltoluamide. The acaricidal mechanism of carvacrol involved multiple pathways: (i) inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity by up to 85.4%, leading to neural disruption; (ii) suppression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (47.4% reduction), α-esterase (24.8% reduction), and β-esterase (28.6% reduction); and (iii) disruption of neural signaling pathways critical for survival. Chemical analysis confirmed carvacrol as the predominant active component in O. vulgare oil, with additional contributions from thymol and thymoquinone. Although its concentration in Iranian oil was lower, thymoquinone demonstrated the highest acaricidal potency (4.98 μg/cm3). Nevertheless, the abundance and superior efficacy of carvacrol establish it as the primary component contributing to the oil’s bioactivity. This study demonstrates that carvacrol is a promising eco-friendly alternative to synthetic acaricides for the control of H. longicornis. Its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and suppress detoxifying enzymes suggests potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with synthetic chemicals. Further studies should focus on optimizing the formulations and applying them in the field to improve efficacy. © 2025 by the authors.",NA,38

Developing efficient composite nanopesticides represents a critical strategy for addressing the above challenges. In this study, solid nanodispersions (SNDs) co-loaded with prochloraz and azoxystrobin were constructed through a self-emulsifying carrier adsorption method. The antifungal activities of the composite SND with a 14:1 ratio of prochloraz to azoxystrobin against Fusarium graminearum and Pyricularia oryzae were 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold higher than those of commercial microemulsions (MEs) with the same proportion of active ingredients. The SND could cause severe oxidative damage to fungi, by reducing the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and break the permeability of cell membranes, resulting in fungal death. Additionally, the composite SND exhibited superior foliar wettability and biosafety with a minimal environmental cost, thereby enhancing the pesticide’s effective utilization rate.

While visual inspection and human interpretation of histology images are useful for initial characterization, such low-throughput procedures suffer from inherent limitations in terms of reliability, objectivity and reproducibility. Artificial intelligence and digital morphometry offer unprecedented opportunities to quickly and accurately assess nuclear morphotypes in relation to tissue damage including skin injury. Methods: In this work, we designed NoxiScore, a pipeline providing an integrated, deep learning-based software solution for fully automated and quantitative analysis of nucleus-related features in histological sections of human skin biopsies. We used this pipeline to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three dermato-cosmetic products massively sold at the time of the study in the Montpellier area (South of France): a sunscreen containing UV filters, a mosquito repellent (with synthetic active ingredient IR3535) and a product combining a natural insect repellent plus a sunscreen. Hematoxylin and eosin or hematoxylin-eosin saffron staining was performed to assess skin structure before morphometric parameter computation. Results: We report the identification of a specific nuclear feature based on variation in texture information that can be used to assess skin tissue damage after oxidative stress or UV exposure. Our data show that application of the commercial sun cream provided efficient protection against UV effects in our ex vivo skin model, whereas application of the mosquito repellent as a single product exerted no protective or toxic effect. Notably, we found that concurrent application of the insect repellent with the sunscreen significantly decreased the UVB protective effect of the sunscreen. Last, histometric analysis of human skin biopsies from multiple donors indicates that the sunscreen-insect repellent combo displayed variable levels of protection against UV irradiation. Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the potential toxicity of combining real-life sunscreen and insect repellent products using ex vivo human skin samples, which most closely imitate the cutaneous physiology. The NoxiScore wet-plus-dry methodology has the potential to provide information about the pharmaco-toxicological profile of topically applied formulations and may also be useful for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of the skin exposome including pesticide exposure, air pollution and water contaminants. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,40

Using the commercial pesticide preparations containing glyphosate, it was shown that the degree of inhibition of the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc largely depends on the formulants rather than on the active ingredient in their composition. Moreover, the combined inhibitory effect of the pesticides mixture on the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc was not additive. According to the results of the inhibitory assay, the type of interaction of pesticide preparations in mixtures depends on both the formulants used and the ratio of pesticides in the mixture. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025.",NA,41

Swarms of this pest have been threatening vast regions of pastures and crops in Africa, Middle East, and South Asia. The biological management of expanding swarms has become a strategy of particular interest due to environmental awareness and economic issues associated with chemical pesticides. The present review aims to explore the latest updates and information about pesticidal plants that are distributed across Africa. Searches on Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases from 2013–2024 revealed a total of 22 plant species probed for insecticidal activities against desert locusts. The formulation, active ingredients, and biological effects of essential oils and other extracts from these plants are presented. Despite the promising anti-insecticidal effects of the plant extracts and compounds, issues related to their solubility and instability under environmental conditions have been observed. To address such major quality defects, methods for the encapsulation of plant natural products within nanostructures are detailed. Given the presence of bioactive compounds with nucleophiles bearing functional groups, the reported plant extracts have been exploited to fabricate metal nanoparticles with inherent insecticidal activities. In this paper, a holistic overview of prepared phytochemical-coated metal nanopesticides is also presented.

Established nanosystems can be enhanced or modified to generate new biological activity patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of chitosan coating of PCL+ATZ NCs on herbicidal activity and interaction mechanisms with Bidens pilosa plants. Chitosan-coated NCs (PCL/CS+ATZ) were synthesized and characterized for size, zeta potential, polydispersity, and encapsulation efficiency. Herbicidal efficiency was assessed in postemergence greenhouse trials, comparing the effects of PCL/CS+ATZ NCs (coated), PCL+ATZ NCs (uncoated), and conventional atrazine (ATZ) on photosystem II (PSII) activity and weed control. Using a hydroponic system, we evaluated the root absorption and shoot translocation of fluorescently labeled NCs. PCL/CS+ATZ presented a positive zeta potential (25 mV), a size of 200 nm, and an efficiency of atrazine encapsulation higher than 90%. The postemergent herbicidal activity assay showed an efficiency gain of PSII activity inhibition of up to 58% compared to ATZ and PCL+ATZ at 96 h postapplication. The evaluation of weed control 14 days after application ratified the positive effect of chitosan coating on herbicidal activity, as the application of PCL/CS+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha-1 resulted in better control than ATZ at 2000 g of a.i. ha-1 and PCL+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha-1. In the hydroponic experiment, chitosan-coated NCs labeled with a fluorescent probe accumulated in the root cortex, with a small quantity reaching the vascular cylinder and leaves up to 72 h after exposure. This behavior resulted in lower leaf atrazine levels and PSII inhibition than ATZ. In summary, chitosan coating of nanoatrazine improved the herbicidal activity against B. pilosa plants when applied to the leaves but negatively affected the root-to-shoot translocation of the herbicide.

The concentration data were first made comparable through an original process removing the bias induced by the space-and-time heterogeneity of the monitoring labs performance, to gather a reference workable set of monthly contamination indicators. These were then used to display the substances’ seasonal and interannual timeseries, revealing, e.g. the succession of PPP active substances contamination peaking periods in the 6 basins, or the long-term trends of the concentrations of the various chemicals, sometimes evidencing insufficiencies in the monitoring performance. These environmental observations were put in regard of the knowledge of the substances ban, restriction or reduction measures, to assess how streams’ chemical quality responds to them. Additionally, the observed contamination features and their variations over the years are discussed in terms of changes in their usages, product substitution, emission sources, and linked to environmental processes like runoff, river dilution and physicochemical conditions. Some original findings and interpretation are provided on glyphosate and AMPA wide-scale data inter-relation, and some light is cast on the efficacy of the recent national policies restricting pesticides use in populated areas. For PPPs, the developed water contamination indicators were compared to tonnage data. We assessed their degree of linear relationship, which we propose to quantitatively express through a substance specific basin-to-river contamination coefficient. The interannual variations of this coefficient appear to be related to the changes in the water contamination seasonal patterns. We were also able to describe and validate the dependency of this coefficient on the molecular properties of the substances, conferring some capabilities for predicting the relative environmental risk induced by non-yet monitored compounds. We finally discuss the relevance of the developed indicators to complement the national chemical pollutants management system currently in place. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,44

Pickering high internal phase emulsions stabilized by covalent organic frameworks solid particles and liquid surfactants (Span80 and polyvinylpyrrolidone) endow the composites with open-cell structures and superwettability. The amphiphilicity and open-cell structures enable rapid adsorption and desorption for cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole, and the solid-phase extraction process can be completed in 5 min. The adsorption efficiencies of polyHIPEs-COFs for cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole are above 85.19%, but lower than 10% for fenvalerate, anti-aphid, and chlorpyrifos, demonstrating the good adsorption selectivity for cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole. The adsorption efficiencies of cyantraniliprole and chlorantraniliprole using a same polyHIPEs-COFs and five different batches of polyHIPEs-COFs range from 94.25 to 100.00%, revealing the good reproducibility of the sorbent. In addition, the polyHIPEs-COF-based solid-phase extraction combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector (HPLC–UV) was developed for determination of bisamide insecticides in vegetable (eggplants, tomatoes, and peppers) samples.

In response to these concerns, we have purified the active components of these adjuvants, specifically a series of oligomers of hydroxy(polyethyleneoxy) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H), including ethylene oxide (EO) units ranging from 4 to 12. For analysis of TSS-H in zebrafish and water, a method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC[sbnd]HRMS) was developed. The findings revealed that at total TSS-H concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg, the average recovery rate of TSS-H containing 4 to 12 EO units in zebrafish ranged from 81.2 % to 107.2 %, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0.1 % and 8.4 %.

Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for TSS-H oligomers (4–12 EO units) were 1.87–11.59 at the low dose and 0.79–9.19 at the high dose after 14 days. The elimination half-lives of the oligomers were <2.37 days during the elimination phase.

Whilst research on herbicides in relation to bees is growing, we still have more to learn about how bees may interact with herbicides and the subsequent consequences for bee health. As herbicides are designed to kill the plants they are applied to, bees and other pollinators may interact with them in a different way to other pesticide groups which is important to understand in the context of evaluating hazard and risk. Here, we conducted both a choice and no-choice test, to determine if bumblebees would be deterred from foraging from feeders containing commercial formulations of Roundup (Ultra and Biactive, respectively) compared to controls. We found across both experiments that bees were deterred from foraging where feeders contained above field-realistic concentrations of Roundup formulation, and that on average colonies reduced their consumption from these feeders by ~50% despite lacking other food sources. This demonstrates that, when given no choice, bees can be deterred from sucrose containing Roundup Biactive, although above expected field concentrations, even to their own nutritional detriment. Separately, individual foragers were observed avoiding feeders containing field-realistic levels of Roundup Ultra compared to controls, showing a preference for uncontaminated feed when given a choice. As this was an experimental setup using high concentrations of Roundup with sucrose solution rather than real flowers, more work is needed to understand this phenomenon under field conditions. This work provides useful information and insights for future studies investigating the impacts of glyphosate in the form of both active substance and formulation on bees and could also be useful in identifying future mitigation strategies for field use. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,47

The characterization studies confirmed significant interactions between the Ag NPs and bioactive components in the nano-biopesticide formulation. The comparative analysis of the aforementioned larval mortality showed better responses in the nano-biopesticide formulation rather than the crude (pure) leaf extract. The LC50 values were calculated both for the nano-biopesticide formulation and pure extract after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment.

This study addresses this issue by preparing asymmetric wetting Janus mesoporous silica nanocarriers (AWJ-MSN) through the adjustment of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer ratios via interfacial modification. Subsequently, asymmetric wetting Janus nanopesticide delivery systems (Thi@AWJ-MSN) were constructed by encapsulating the model pesticide molecule, thiafuramide (Thi). The coexistence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments on the AWJ-MSN imparts interfacial activity, enhancing spreadability on plant leaves with different wettability (Brassica chinensis L., Cucumis sativus L., and Arachis hypogaea L.). The droplet impact behavior of the AWJ-MSN on plant leaves and artificial PTFE membrane surfaces was analyzed through normalization, revealing a reduced normalized spreading height (Ht/D0) and an increased normalized spreading diameter (Dt/D0). These findings indicate the enhanced foliar deposition ability of the AWJ-MSN under real-world foliar spraying conditions. Furthermore, the encapsulation of Thi within the nanocarriers protects the active pesticide ingredients, enabling sustained release through quasi-Fickian diffusion and ultimately prolonging the pesticide’s efficacy.

DFT analyzed the mechanism for regulating the molecular properties of CSDs by different modification methods, and explored the intensity and type of interaction force between cedrol/α-cedrene and three CSDs. The results show that cedrol and α-cedrene were more easily aggregated near the modified CSDs, with CS-g-PLA showing the strongest trapping ability.

The current study designed and applied an efficient and eco-friendly nano-herbicide via metamifop (MP) modified by hydrophilic and lipophilic diblock polymer (HLDP), namely MP@HLDP. The HLDP was assembled with MP via electrostatic interaction, and the spontaneous complexation of MP with HLDP formed nearly spherical nanoparticles. The presence of HLDP reduced the contact angle of MP while increasing its retention, resulting in better foliar wettability and easier spreading of the droplets on weed leaves. Meanwhile, the plant uptake of MP@HLDP was enhanced, remarkably improving its herbicidal activity toward weed Echinochloa crus-galli (E. crusgalli), when compared to the commercial emulsion oil and technical compound even at a 30% reduced dosage. The conjoint analysis of transcriptomic and metabolome data indicated activation of the plant death responses by MP@HLDP nanoparticles through inhibiting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and chlorophyll metabolism. The safety evaluation of MP@HLDP nanoparticles on rice crops and systematic model nontarget organism revealed good safety to rice seedlings with reduced acute toxicity to aquatic zebrafish. Overall, new insights into creating an efficient and environmentally friendly herbicide nano-formulation were provided, promising for use in sustainable agriculture production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",NA,52

Its rapid proliferation and voracious predatory behavior pose a significant threat to native insects, particularly honeybees and other pollinators, impacting agricultural production, biodiversity, and human safety. Eradication in Europe seems now impossible, and the control efforts are hindered by the lack of standardized application protocols, including for insecticide use, leading to potential indiscriminate pesticide application and, consequently, environmental damages. Our study evaluated the acute contact toxicity on V. v. nigrithorax workers of four commercially available formulations containing acetamiprid, cypermethrin, a mix of natural pyrethrins, and Spinosad as active ingredients. These tests were performed in laboratory conditions, offering novel data for the chemical control of this invasive species. Our results suggest acetamiprid and spinosad as promising candidates for the yellow-legged hornet control. Further research is needed to validate their efficacy under field conditions and assess ecological impacts of these pesticides on non-target organisms. Integrated pest management strategies should prioritize insecticides with low non-target toxicity and minimal environmental persistence to mitigate resistance development and ensure effective pest control. Comprehensive assessments considering multiple factors beyond mortality are essential for informing sustainable pest control strategies. © 2025 Malaquias Souto et al.

Controlling dense conifer invasions is challenging and requires both effective initial control methods and long-term site management to prevent re-invasion. Broadcast aerial herbicide application is often the preferred treatment method for dense infestations of pines with high rates of complex herbicide mixtures used. The objective of this study was to: (i) test the efficacy of four simple herbicide mixes (containing two active ingredients and one adjuvant) as compared to an operational standard (four active ingredients and three adjuvants) for control of Pinus contorta invasions in a field trial and (ii) to quantify the effect of treatment mixes on non-target vegetation to determine impacts to plant community composition. RESULTS: We found that a simplified herbicide mix containing two active ingredients and one adjuvant was equally as effective as the current operational standard, with efficacy for all treatments increasing as a function of stem density. All herbicide treatments significantly impacted the post-spray community composition with differences among treatments in post-spray vegetation composition also detected. Following all treatments plant communities transitioned from a mixed native/exotic grassland-herb community to a simplified community dominated by exotic grasses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a simpler herbicide mix could be used for broadcast aerial control of dense pine invasion reducing total herbicide input and cost of the operation. Post-spray vegetation community recovery could reflect the impact of the herbicides used in the operation compounded by soil biogeochemical processes already initiated through the pine invasion. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,54

This study aimed to investigate the toxicological effects of this molecule on isolated rat liver mitochondria, evaluating both isolated and formulated 2,4-D to comprehend the differential impacts on mitochondrial function. Our investigations did not reveal significant induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial swelling or impacts on mitochondrial respiration; however, exposure to both forms of 2,4-D affected mitochondrial membrane integrity and function in a concentration-dependent manner, notably impacting mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential. Comparatively, the formulated product showed toxicity at lower concentrations regarding interaction with membranes and ATP levels (from 0.4 μM on) and isolated 2,4-D showed toxicity at lower concentrations regarding membrane potential dissipation (from 10 μM on). Notably, the effects on ATP levels and membrane fluidity suggest interactions within the mitochondrial lipid bilayer. The findings highlight that excipients in the commercial formulation of 2,4-D potentially alter its effects, underlining the importance of evaluating not only active ingredients but also formulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,55

The influence of the key structural functional groups of surfactants on the interaction between pesticide droplets and hydrophobic pear leaves has not been explored. The behavior of Imidacloprid (Imid) droplets regulated by cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants with different structures on hydrophobic pear leaves and their bouncing dynamics were studied. RESULTS: The properties of pesticide droplets regulated by rosin-based bicationic quaternary ammonium salt and ethylene (dodecyl polyoxyethylene/tetradecyl polyoxyethylene) chloride/ammonium bromide were well matched with those of pear leaves with a waxy layer. This structure was closely related to the double-chain structure corresponding to that of double N-head groups in quaternary ammonium surfactants. Quaternary ammonium surfactants regulate the wetting of droplets by forming semi-micellar structures near the three-phase contact line, which drives the droplets to wet and spread on the leaf. The quaternary ammonium surfactant containing the double N-head structure enabled strong wetting and adhesion of pesticide droplets on the hydrophobic surface. The key structural functional groups of different quaternary ammonium surfactants directionally modified the impact kinetics of Imid droplets on the leaf surfaces and their changing trend. CONCLUSION: The double N-head structure played a key role in the molecular structure of quaternary ammonium surfactants, and the hyperbranched ethylene oxide (EO) chain played a small role in the molecular structure. These results clearly indicate how the structure of key functional groups of quaternary ammonium surfactants regulated the interface adhesion of pesticide droplets on the leaf surfaces and explain the microscopic mechanism of their interaction. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,58

A key factor in national malaria vector control/elimination programmes is the rate at which these insecticides decay. VECTRON™ T500, with broflanilide as its active ingredient, is a recently developed candidate insecticide formulation which has shown promising results in certain phase II experimental hut trials. However, its residual efficacy across different settings has not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated the efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 on various wall surfaces (mud, dung, paint, and cement) and assessed its decay rates over time in Ethiopia. Methods: Insectary-reared Anopheles arabiensis Sekoru strain mosquitoes were used to evaluate the residual efficacy of VECTRON™ T500. Female mosquitoes, aged three to five days were used for the bioassays. Seven 'tukul' type test huts, each hut with a distinct wall type (mud, dung, painted, and cemented) were used for the study. Three huts received VECTRON™ T500; three huts were sprayed with Actellic 300CS, and one hut served as a negative control (sprayed with water only). Results: VECTRON™ T500 induced over 80% mortality across all wall surface types throughout the entire nine-month study period. In contrast, Actellic® 300CS achieved over 80% mortality for six months, except on dung wall surfaces, after which its efficacy declined sharply below 80%. Conclusion: Overall, the mortality rates achieved with VECTRON™ T500 extended up to nine months across all treated wall surface types, outperforming Actellic® 300CS. This could make VECTRON™ T500 a promising candidate insecticide formulation for use in IRS in malaria-endemic countries such as Ethiopia. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,59

The use of kraft lignin, a renewable material with its chemical modification, is an opportunity to develop advanced and sustainable materials to reduce the negative impact of agrochemicals on the environment by reducing the active ingredient (AI) quantity for application. This work deals with the preparation, characterization, determination of incorporation efficiency (IE), and validation by in-field experiments of three fungicide nanoformulations using lignin-based carriers and prothioconazole (PTZ) and tebuconazole (TBZ) as AI at a mass ratio of 5 g of carrier: 600 mg of AI.

However, current systems face challenges in achieving both high encapsulation rates and drug loading capacities. This study introduces a novel method using chitosan (CS) and sodium lignosulfonate (SL) to co-assemble with avermectin (AVM), a widely used hydrophobic pesticide, forming AVM-CS-SL micro-nano capsules. Engineered under optimized conditions of pH 5 and 40 °C, the capsules exhibit an AVM encapsulation efficiency of 84.27 % and a loading capacity of 90 %. The AVM-CS-SL capsules demonstrate multifunctional attributes that enhance pesticide application. The capsules, with an average diameter of 356 nm, facilitate stable embedding in leaf grooves and enable effective adhesion to leaf surfaces, thereby improving their resistance to wash-off by rain compared to conventional formulations. Their core-shell structure protects AVM from photodegradation, ensuring long-term stability and efficacy. The capsules also exhibit enhanced bioactivity, with higher mortality rates in Plutella xylostella larvae and low genotoxicity to Vicia faba plants.

The highest mortality of J2 juveniles of the nematode Nacobbus aberrans was 92.3% at a concentration of 30 mg/mL. Among the phytopathogenic fungi, the concentration of 1.0% of the crude extract of the biosurfactant was the one that obtained the highest percentage inhibition against the phytopathogens Fusarium oxysporum 72.2%, Fusarium sp., 80.2% and Alternaria solani 100% at 168 h of incubation. Analysis of the BS by GC-MS revealed the presence of the three amino acids alanine, homocystine and valine in its composition. As well as the presence of fatty acids: stearic acid, lauric acid and palmitic acid. With nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrophotometry (MS) analysis, the crude extract was found to have the structure of a quaternary ammonium salt derived from stearic fatty acid, which is a component of the biosurfactant. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that the BS produced by S. ureilytica has a lipopeptide-like chemical structure and possesses nematicidal and fungicidal activity, and is therefore proposed for potential use and application as a biopesticide for the benefit of regenerative and sustainable agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",NA,62

Additionally, their production involves synthetic chemicals and generates large amounts of by-products, further exacerbating the ecological burden. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an environmentally friendly nanodelivery system that can enhance the efficacy of pesticides while minimizing both environmental and health risks. Here, a metal mineralization strategy was employed to reinforce the self-assembly of biocompatible nanocapsules with versatile surface functionalities for smart delivery of lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT). During the homogenization process, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), chitosan (COS), and copper ions co-precipitated at the oil–water interface and self-assembled into core–shell nanocapsules, acquiring the desired surface functionality through electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and metal coordination. The resulting LCT@CMC@COS-Cu nanocapsules demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency for LCT and superior pesticide delivery performance targeting lepidopteran pests, enabled by the alkaline- and cellulase-responsive polysaccharide-based capsule shells. Foliar washing experiments demonstrated that LCT@CMC@COS-Cu adhere efficiently to the surface of soybean leaves and achieved bidirectional transport through the plant's vascular system. Notably, LCT@CMC@COS-Cu significantly extended the half-life of LCT under UV irradiation by 9.9-fold compared to technical LCT. In pot experiments, the mortality rate of Spodoptera litura larvae treated with LCT@CMC@COS-Cu (56.67 %) was significantly higher than that of the LCT suspension concentrate (16.67 %) after 12 days, implying prolonged efficacy.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of glyphosate exposure (both as the active ingredient and its formulated product) on sperm quality, fertilization success, and development of pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis), a native freshwater fish species from Argentina. Results revealed a statistically significant increase in sperm motility at the highest concentration of the formulated product. In contrast, exposure to the active ingredient resulted in a decrease in certain motility parameters. Fertilization assays and embryonic development showed no notable effects in exposed groups. There were no effects in the morphology or temporal evolution of the embryonic stages, nor in the hatching rate. In contrast, larvae exposed to the formulated product exhibited a significant increase in mortality rates, reaching 100% mortality at the highest concentration within a few hours.

This comparative study was carried out with four populations of R. microplus from four Brazilian farms. For laboratory assays, technical grade compounds of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were used in the LPT, while fipronil and ivermectin were used in the LIT. The AIT was conducted using commercial spray formulations containing pyrethroid and organophosphate: cypermethrin 187.5 ppm + chlorpyrifos 375 ppm + fenthion 187.5 ppm and chlorpyrifos 825 ppm + High-Cis cypermethrin 99 ppm. For the field assays, the same commercial products of the AIT used, a pour-on formulation of fipronil 1 mg/kg, injectable 200 µg/kg ivermectin, injectable 630 µg/kg ivermectin, injectable 200 µg/kg doramectin and injectable 200 µg/kg moxidectin. For field studies, populations of R. microplus with the mean therapeutic efficacy ≤89 %, on days 7 up to 21 post-treatment, were classified as resistant to such compounds. To standardize the comparative analysis between laboratory and field results, this same value of larval efficacy or mortality (≤89 %) was used to classify the population as resistant by laboratory tests (LPT, LIT, and AIT). Of the 16 laboratory tests conducted using R. microplus larvae (LPT and LIT), 66.6 % showed no relation with field study results. Inconsistencies were observed in 100 % of cases for spray formulations, 25 % for fipronil, and 75 % for macrocyclic lactones. Although the efficacy results of the AIT with commercial formulations were slightly higher than the therapeutic efficacy observed in the field, it is important to note that there was a 100 % positive relation in the classification of the status of the four populations, which were all considered susceptible in both laboratory and field analyses. These findings demonstrate that, in situations like this study, it is essential to calibrate laboratory tests using larvae, particularly against field results, for each formulation. This approach will allow for more accurate recommendations regarding the use of a chemical formulation for a specific tick population. Furthermore, it reduces the risk of incorrectly identifying R. microplus population as resistant or susceptible and helps clarify the practical implications of resistance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",NA,65

Changes in soil management can influence the structure and organisation of pore space in soil, which drives changes in the transport of particulates and dissolved substances. Formulation of pesticides can be used to change the delivery of active ingredients to soil; however, it is currently unknown how changing the formulation of an herbicide can influence the transport properties between ZT vs. ploughing. We investigated the bioefficacy of two formulations of the herbicide atrazine, a pre- and post-emergence herbicide that inhibits photosystem II. Bioefficacy was assessed using physical measures and survival analysis of an early photosynthesis-dependent weed species, Amaranthus retroflexus L., over time, and soil pore network structure was assessed by analysing three-dimensional images produced by X-ray Computed Tomography. Increasing the herbicide application rate generally improved bioefficacy, though it was reduced in soils managed under ZT. Under herbicide-treated ZT samples, survival time was higher, ranging from 13.4 to 18.2 days compared with 12.6 to 15.4 days in ploughed samples, the mean dry plant mass was higher, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg compared with 0.05 to 0.68 mg in ploughed samples, and the mean total plant length was higher, ranging from 1.73 to 12.1 mm compared with 0.2 to 5.45 mm in ploughed samples. Changes in the soil pore network previously demonstrated to be indicators of preferential transport were correlated with measures of bioefficacy, including pore thickness and connectivity density. Reduced atrazine efficacy under ZT is problematic considering the inherent reliance on chemical methods for weed control, we suggest that pursuing formulation strategies to alleviate potential risks of loss via preferential transport may be fruitful. © 2025 by the authors.",NA,66

To counter these challenges, the development of nanoformulations represents a pivotal strategy. These advanced formulations are designed to enhance the efficacy of active ingredients (AIs) and reduce ecological impacts, thereby addressing the need for sustainable agricultural development. Objectives: The study aims to fabricate a highly leaf-adhesive and anti-UV herbicide nanoformulation, designed to enhance the herbicidal activity and utilization rates of AIs. Methods: Herein, the herbicide nanoformulations (Called CB@MSNs-TA-Fe) are synthesized by incorporating cyhalofop-butyl into tannic acid-Fe (III) ions-coated functionalized mesoporous silica. The foliar retention performance of the samples was assessed integrating SEM observation and HPLC analysis. Results: The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe with rough outer surface displays typical core–shell structure featuring an average diameter of about 118 nm. After amino modification, the CB@MSNs-TA-Fe shows enhanced loading rate for CB (14.4 ± 0.2 %) and superior thermal stability. The release rate of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe under acidic conditions is higher compared to that under alkaline and neutral conditions. Upon UV irradiation, the half-life of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe nanoparticles is 12.4 times higher than that of CB technical (CB TC). Enhanced foliar adhesion of CB@MSNs-TA-Fe on hydrophobic leaf surfaces is observed, which can effectively mitigate the risk of wash-off by rainfall. The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe displays enhanced herbicidal efficacies against barnyard grass under UV irradiation or simulated rainwater scouring, compared with CB TC and CB oil dispersion. Furthermore, the TA-Fe-coated MSNs-NH2 nano-carrier (MSNs-TA-Fe) reveals excellent biosafety on rice, zebrafish, and earthworms. Conclusion: The developed TA-Fe-functionalized herbicide nanoformulations, with high foliar adhesion and anti-UV properties, effectively improve the utilization efficiency of AIs, thus offering innovative solutions for the development of efficient pesticide formulations. © 2024",NA,67

These attributes make it a highly valuable candidate for antifungal therapy and as an antibiotic adjuvant. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of BBR’s antifungal properties, focusing on its in vitro and in vivo activity, underlying mechanisms, and its influence on fungal pathogenicity, including virulence, biofilm formation, and resistance. Additionally, the antifungal potential of BBR extracts, derivatives, and nanoformulations is examined in detail. BBR demonstrates fungicidal effects through multiple mechanisms. It targets critical fungal components such as mitochondria, cell membranes, and cell walls, while also inhibiting enzymatic activity and transcription processes. Furthermore, it suppresses the expression of virulence factors, effectively diminishing fungal pathogenicity. Beyond its direct antifungal activity, BBR exerts beneficial effects on the host by modulating gut microbiota, thereby bolstering host defenses against fungal infections and reducing potential adverse effects. BBR’s interaction with conventional antifungal drugs presents a unique complexity, particularly in the context of resistance mechanisms. When used in combination therapies, conventional antifungal drugs enhance the intracellular accumulation of BBR, thereby amplifying its antifungal potency as the primary active agent. These synergistic effects position BBR as a promising candidate for combination strategies, especially in addressing drug-resistant fungal infections and persistent biofilms. As antifungal resistance and biofilm-associated infections continue to rise, the multifaceted properties of BBR and its advanced formulations highlight their significant therapeutic potential. However, the scarcity of robust in vivo and clinical studies limits a full understanding of its efficacy and safety profile. To bridge this gap, future investigations should prioritize well-designed in vivo and clinical trials to thoroughly evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of BBR in diverse clinical settings. This approach could pave the way for its broader application in combating fungal infections. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",NA,69

We measured biomarkers that included detoxification responses (glutathione S-transferase, GST), oxidative stress levels (lipid peroxidation, LPO, and catalase, CAT), DNA damage (comet assay), energy reserves (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and immune response (lysozyme activity, LYS). The absence of significant differences in catalase and lipid peroxidation levels suggested no oxidative stress due to fungicide exposure. However, the foliar fungicide Amistar®Xtra induced the highest GST activity and DNA fragmentation, suggesting synergistic effects between its active ingredients and undisclosed co-formulants. Similar effects observed with the Amistar®Xtra-Prosaro® mixture confirmed the greater toxicity of Amistar®Xtra.

Particularly, 3D GrNFs/DWCNTs-CeO2NPs porous films were fabricated via thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method by using sodium deoxycholate (SDC) surfactant as a carbon source. The use of 3D GrNFs/DWCNTs-CeO2NPs porous film has much improved electrical conductivity, charge transfer kinetics, and the electroactive surface area of the modified electrodes. Consequently, the proposed sensor showed great performances for detection of MAL in the concentration range from 10−4 ppb to 1 ppb with the detection limit (LOD) as low as 2.06 × 10−4 ppb (0.620 pM) (DPV mode) and 2.07 × 10−4 ppb (0.623 pM) (SWV mode).

There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective new acaricidal agents. Essential oils and their volatile compounds are promising alternatives. Ensuring the use of optimal solvents or surfactants that do not compromise the acaricidal activity of these compounds during testing is crucial. This study aims to evaluate how compounds thymol, carvacrol and eugenol interact with xylol, methanol, ethanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, castor oil, propylene glycol, vaseline, and Tween 80® to enhance (or to worse) their acaricidal efficacy against R. microplus. Larval mortality time were compared against one negative control (soybean oil) and two positive controls (commercial pour-on products). The experiments were conducted in 48-well polyethylene plates, with around 100 larvae immersed in 200 μl of each solvent at 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.56% and diluted in soybean oil or water, according to solubility. Each volatile compound (Thymol, carvacrol and eugenol) was diluted in the tested solvents to assess larval mortality time. Xylol demonstrated the shortest larval mortality time, even at a minimum concentration (p < 0.05). In contrast, liquid vaseline exhibited the longest larval mortality time. When thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol were combined with xylol, they achieved the shortest larval mortality time. Conversely, when diluted in liquid vaseline they exhibited synergistic effects decreasing the mortality time. Tween 80® worsen the efficacy of thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, resulting in prolonged larval mortality times.

It describes a comprehensive classification of EPF, revealing their taxonomy and mechanisms of infection with insect pests, after providing a brief historical context. Isolation techniques for EPF, common mass production of conidia, formulation types, and commercial EPF products are also discussed to provide basic guidelines on the development of a mycopesticide. Challenges and advantages in developing EFP products are also discussed to reduce the risk of failure. The chapter also shares the results of a case study on the development of a wettable powder (WP) formulation of mycoinsecticide using Metarhizium anisopliae. It describes the vital processes of product development, starting from the preparation of the inoculum until the application of the formulation in the fields. In the study, a diphasic approach involving liquid media and solid-state incubations of the fungus was selected to mass produce the active ingredient. The formulation was prepared by using 40% of the fungal conidia, 60% of inert ingredients, and 0.1% UV protectant. Field trials conducted in medicinal plant plantations of Eurycoma longifolia demonstrated that the formulation was practically and effectively used for the control of the plant’s most destructive insect pest, Atteva sciodoxa larvae. The mortality of the pest larvae due to the fungal infection was 69.0%–75.5%.

However, pyrethroid resistance by stored product insects has become widespread. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate whether a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), could rescue efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin LLIN against a field strain and pyrethroid-resistant strain of maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) in the laboratory. Adult S. zeamais were first exposed to the vials treated with PBO or acetone (solvent control) for 1 h or 3 h, then exposed to either alpha-cypermethrin LLIN or control netting for 1 h or 3 h. Immediate mortality was recorded directly after exposure, as well as delayed mortality at 24, 48, 72, and 168 h later with adult conditions recorded as alive, affected, or dead. At 1-h exposure, the addition of PBO significantly reduced the percentage of field strain S. zeamais adults alive by 7–42% after subsequently exposed to LLIN compared to the control, but PBO did not significantly affect the percentage of alive pyrethroid-resistant adults. After a 3-h exposure, there were significantly fewer field strain (by 24–47%) and pyrethroid-resistant (by 13–36%) individuals alive when exposed to PBO compared to the control. PBO elicited quicker mortality for the pyrethroid-resistant strain. We confirmed in a separate assay that our susceptible laboratory strain was more susceptible than our field and pyrethroid-resistant strain of S. zeamais. Our results suggest that the addition of a synergist to LLIN formulations may improve efficacy against stored product insects and support resistance management. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2025.",NA,74

The properties of nanopesticides make their drift and environmental behavior more unpredictable than traditional formulations. Our aim was to compare the ecotoxicity of two insecticides with λ-cyhalothrin as a.i.: a nano-based one and a traditional emulsified, considering the incidence of temperature according to climate change prospections (20 and 24 °C). We evaluated their effects on Daphnia magna survival, body stores, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Although after 24 h the traditional formulation had greater lethality than the nanopesticide, after 48 h this pattern was reversed. At 24 °C the lethality of both pesticides increased. BChE activity was inhibited at 24 °C by both pesticides. In general, the increase in temperature negatively affected protein and glycogen content. The traditional formulation reduced glycogen content at 24 °C. A decrease in lipid content and the whole energy budget was observed in organisms exposed to the traditional formulation at both temperatures. Although the nano-based pesticide developed a delayed toxicity, it was more lethal than the traditional one in the long term. The temperature rise worsened the pesticides effects in terms of decreased survival, BChE activity inhibition, and energy reserves depletion. The development and regulation of new eco-safer nanopesticides needs to be complemented by their ecotoxicological assessment.

As there is a need to develop less toxic, and environmentally friendly surfactants, therefore, amino acid-based biosurfactants that are produced from renewable raw materials are of great demand nowadays and can be used as an alternative to conventional chemical surfactants. The negative effects of chemical surfactants present in agrochemicals and modern detergents can damage human health and the environment, thus there is a crucial requirement to explore innovative, well planned, as well as cost-effective natural products for the welfare of humanity. Biodegradable surfactants created through green chemistry, specifically amino acid-based surfactants, are a favourable alternative to avoid these risks. Since amino acids (AAs) are inexhaustible compounds, therefore biosurfactants based on AAs have abundant potential as eco-friendly and environmentally friendly substances. Their higher biodegradation ability, low or even no toxicity, temperature stability, and tolerance to pH fluctuations make these biosurfactants preferable over chemical surfactants. In modern agriculture, most chemical pesticides and fertilizers used are frequently associated with numerous environmental issues. Hence, the development of green molecules as biosurfactants has a promising role in this regard to ensure agricultural sustainability. Biosurfactants can be harnessed for plant pathogen management, plant growth elevation, improving the quality of agricultural soil by soil remediation, degradation of complex hydrocarbons, increasing bioavailability of nutrients for advantageous plant-microbe interactions, and improving plant immunity, hence, they can supersede the grim synthetic surfactants which are presently being used. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025.",NA,78

At a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1, BSAW exhibited notable larvicidal activity, leading to structural impairments and cellular dysfunctions in A. aegypti larvae while also disrupting their associated bacterial microbiota. Moreover, BSAW effectively deterred oviposition in adult mosquitoes.

Herein, we aim to evaluate the impacts of chronic ecologically relevant 2,4-D exposure on reproductive systems of fathead minnow. Juvenile fathead minnows were exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D in DMA4 herbicide under laboratory conditions in a flow through system. Male plasma testosterone concentrations, testicular and ovarian histology, and differential gene expression along the HPGL axis in three tissue types (brain, liver, and gonad) were assessed after a chronic 120 day exposure period. We observed significantly decreased plasma testosterone concentration in male fish exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.50, 2.00, and 4.00 mg/L) of 2,4-D. We observed a significant increase in ovarian severity grading and oocyte atresia in female fish exposed to 4.00 mg/L.

The main objective is to improve the ingredient concentrations maximizing the insecticidal activity of the biofilm and to study the desorption of Calothrixin A according to the diffusion parameters. Eight biofilm formulations were prepared with different concentrations of the components and tested on Sitona lineatus and Bruchus pisorum. The results show that a high concentration of Calothrixin A tended to increase insecticidal activity, although this increase was not always significant, while a higher concentration of collagen and chitosan reduced insecticidal activity, probably by limiting the diffusion of the active ingredient. The prediction models for insecticidal activity showed that the interaction of the factors had no significant impact on the responses, but the model for Sitona lineatus presented better accuracy. The diffusion tests revealed that the CB3C-5 biofilm, with high diffusion parameters, correlated with insecticidal activity. The characterization of the CB3C-5 biofilm showed adequate physical, mechanical, thermal, and structural properties for agricultural seed storage application. Moreover, the computational approach showed that Calothrixin A interacts more efficiently with the OR5-Orco complex than with the small OBP, disrupting the olfactory detection of insects. This mechanism highlights the targeting of the olfactory complex as a potential strategy to control insect pests.

Most producers rely heavily on the application of chemical pesticides to control pests and diseases of grapes and grapevines. With increasing rates of fungicide use, active ingredients may decrease in efficacy or become inefficacious due to the emergence of resistance in the organism targeted by the treatment. This research was conducted with the aim of assessing the sensitivity of Botrytis cinerea to five fungicide formulations (active ingredients: boscalid, cyprodinil + fludioxonil, fenpyrazamine, fenhexamid, and pyrimethanil), four of which have been registered and used for more than 10 years in Croatia. Even at the highest concentrations tested, pyrimethanil, boscalid and fenhexamid caused fungal inhibition at a rate significantly lower than 90%. Conversely, cyprodinil + fludioxonil had inhibition rates greater than 90% for 72% of the isolates. Finally, the fungicide fenpyrazamine, which is not registered for use in Croatian viticulture, resulted in fungal inhibition rates of less than 40%. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies conducted in the Slavonia region of Croatia on the potential emergence of resistance to chemically active ingredients in B. cinerea populations. The results of the present study show that B. cinerea resistance to several active ingredients is of significant concern due to the small number of registered products available in Croatia to combat the disease this fungus causes on grapes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Società Italiana di Patologia Vegetale (S.I.Pa.V.) 2024.",NA,84

During the past decade, biosurfactants are widely applicable as emulsifiers, foaming and vetting agents and are useful for food additives, foods, agrochemicals, cosmetics, beverages and pharmaceuticals. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistant pathogens has highlighted the urgent need for new approaches in pharmaceuticals to address these growing concerns, microbial surfactants have now emerged as safe and potential drug molecules. Biosurfactants possess antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties which makes them promising alternatives for use in the treatment of various diseases. Additionally, microbial surfactants are useful for controlling formation of biofilm, healing of wounds, treatment of skin and oral infections, target site delivery of drugs and treatment of cancer. Moreover, biosurfactants can also prevent the adhesion of substance to the surfaces, for medical insertional materials results in decreased infections in hospitals without using any synthetic anti-microbial drugs. The objective of this chapter is to observe the role and function of microbial released biosurfactants accompanying their advantages over chemically synthesized equivalent in pharmaceuticals. © 2025 R.Z.

However, by foraging on agricultural crops, bees may become contaminated with compounds used for pest control. In this study, we exposed bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies to the insecticide imidacloprid (IMD) under field conditions to assess the occurrence of oxidative stress in larvae and pupae and investigate morphological changes in the fat body and midgut of larvae and midgut of adult bees. The apiary area was divided into three groups: control, commercial formulation containing IMD (Evidence® 700WG) (IMDCF), and IMD active ingredient (Sigma–Aldrich) (IMDAI). Treatment groups were fed syrup containing 1 µg L−1 IMD, whereas the control group was fed syrup only. Compared with the control, larvae exposed to IMDCF or IMDAI for 42 days exhibited morphological changes in the external body, midgut, and fat body. The midgut of adult bees contaminated with IMDCF showed only structural remnants of the peritrophic membrane and absence of regenerative cell nests. Oxidative stress analyses revealed that IMDCF-exposed larvae had higher nitrite and carbonylated protein contents and lower catalase and superoxide dismutase activity than control individuals. In pupae, IMDAI decreased catalase activity while increasing superoxide dismutase activity. These findings indicate that IMD has the potential to significantly impact the development of bees and their colonies by disrupting vital organs responsible for normal physiological functioning and overall activities of individuals. Oxidative stress, which was detected at different stages of bee development, may induce lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation, leading to cell death. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,86

Mortality, hatching rate, spontaneous contraction, heartbeat, morphological changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), skeletal development, and locomotor behavior of zebrafish were analyzed. Embryos were exposed to imidacloprid (IMI) and β-cyfluthrin (β-CYF) in the following ratios: 0.001 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.000125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C1); 0.01 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.00125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C2); 0.1 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.0125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C3); 1.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C4); 10.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 1.25 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C5) for 144 h. The results showed a mortality of 50 % of organisms in the C5 concentration. Embryos exposed to C1 and C3 showed tachycardia and hatched early compared to the negative control, indicating cardiotoxic and embryotoxic effects. The two highest concentrations tested (C4 and C5) induced evident morphological changes (yolk sac and pericardial edema, and spine alterations), and skeletal toxicity (absence of cartilage and bone formation), along with decreased larval swimming behavior. Also, the formulated insecticide (C1) increased ROS levels in zebrafish larvae. Results showed that the formulated insecticide containing IMI and β-CYF induces several toxic effects on developing zebrafish, indicating its environmental risk to aquatic organisms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",NA,87

Exploring the intricate interplay between surfactants, pesticide formulations, and the evolving surface properties of banana leaves throughout their growth stages is critical to the enhancement of pesticide application methods and the elevation of agricultural productivity. RESULTS: Through investigating the regulatory impact of surfactants on the physicochemical properties of medicinal solutions, this study elucidates the interaction mechanism between the physicochemical properties of pesticides and the surface characteristics of banana leaves. The findings reveal that the energy dissipation rate of pesticide droplets exhibits a natural exponential rise in correlation with the increase in both the We number and the concentration of surfactant present. Comparatively, the adaxial surface of banana leaves demonstrates superior spreading and adhesion properties for droplets than the abaxial surface. Specifically, droplets containing the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate on the adaxial surface of banana leaves are found to spread well with a reduced retraction effect. Conversely, the application of the non-ionic surfactant fatty acid polyoxyethylene ether (AEO-3) on the abaxial surface of banana leaves is more beneficial for the wetting and retention of droplets. As banana leaves grow, there is a noted decline in the spreading and retraction properties of droplets. However, droplets have a higher propensity to wet and adhere to the surfaces of mature banana leaves. CONCLUSION: To bolster the adherence of pesticide droplets to leaf surfaces, it is imperative to ensure they possess superior spreading properties and a controlled retraction pace. This facilitates an extended period of contact and enhanced stability, thereby optimizing the spray's deposition efficacy. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,89

Polyoxyethylene tallow amines (POEAs) are surfactants most widely used in GBH formulations, making up to 5–15 % by weight. However, neither POEA exposure nor their toxicity has been well studied in the general population. This study leverages second trimester urine samples collected from 86 pregnant participants of a multi-center, US-based pregnancy cohort. We measured three POEA homologs, i.e., C16s(EO)2, C18u(EO)2, and C18s(EO)2, using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem with mass spectrometry. These homologs were detected in 79 %, 97 %, and 59 % of the samples (LOD: 0.1 ng/mL) at a mean concentration of 1.87, 1.88, and 1.65 ng/mL, respectively. While these homologs were highly correlated with each other (rho >0.7), their correlations with GLY and its breakdown product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), were moderate (rho <0.4). Compared to other races, the POEA level in urine was the lowest in White participants (p = 0.047). We observed an indication that a higher POEA level was associated with increased ano-genital distance (AGD), a marker of gestational androgen milieu, in male infants only (β = 2.46, p = 0.057); such relationship remained unchanged after adjusting for GLY (β = 2.45, p = 0.055) or AMPA (β = 2.46, p = 0.058). Despite the small sample size, our study provides the first population data on POEA exposure which demonstrates widespread exposure in the general population. Suggestive associations between urinary POEA and AGD in male newborns implicate potential endocrine disrupting property of POEA, which warrant further investigation in larger studies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",NA,90

This study investigates the impact of non-ionic surfactant alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) on the penetration of two pesticides, systemic thiabendazole and non-systemic phosmet, in apple and spinach. Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using two different detection methods, namely XZ depth mapping and XY area mapping, in conjunction with liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to investigate the penetration of various pesticide formulations over time. The SERS results showed that APEOs significantly increased the penetration depth of thiabendazole by 93.3 % in spinach and 21.4 % in apples, as well as enhanced the characteristic peak intensity by 73.52 % in spinach and 152.24 % in apples at the depth level of −60 µm after 3-day exposure. LC–MS/MS confirmed the consistent increases in internal thiabendazole residues in both fresh produce models due to APEOs. However, APEOs did not affect the penetration of the non-systemic phosmet in either apple or spinach. The combination of these two SERS mapping methods can provide a comprehensive understanding of the penetration profiles of different systemic pesticide formulations at various sensoria. This research advances the application of SERS mapping for studying the impact of nonionic surfactants on pesticide penetration which will aid the development of strategies to improve pesticide application efficiency and enhance food safety. © 2024",NA,91

However, they can impact non-target soil organisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of eight seed treatments (including two authorized for organic farming) on root colonization of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. One experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions, on a sterile substrate inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833 and one in field conditions, where winter wheat was colonized by native soil AM fungi. In greenhouse conditions, the six conventional seed treatments reduced root colonization five weeks after sowing. No difference with the control treatment was measured thereafter for a product containing triazole alone. In contrast, seed treatments containing fludioxonil (fungicide molecule alone or formulated with the triazole difenoconazole), and prochloraz formulated with the triazole triticonazole significantly reduced root colonization until 11 weeks after sowing. Notably, when formulated with sedaxane, the adverse effect of fludioxonil was reduced. The negative effect of seed treatments on AM fungal root colonization in field was smaller than in the greenhouse and generally not significant, with disparate results from one timestep to another. This may be related to the dilution or the degradation of the active ingredients in the soil during the winter period or AM fungal species/strain involved in symbiosis. Overall, our results outline that the direct effect of seed treatment is highly variable depending on the modes of action, half-lives and interactions between active ingredients. By contributing to highlight the undesired effects of pesticides on AM fungi (i.e., by delaying root colonization), this study pleads for a reduction of pesticide applications to encourage the rapid and efficient establishment of functional mycorrhizal symbioses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",NA,94

In line with this objective, we present green preparation of a colloidal pesticide formulation using optimized lysine-derived carbon dots (LysCDs)-modified CaCO3 (LysCDs/CaCO3) particles as the carrier and abamectin (Abm) as the active ingredient. The loading capacity of abamectin in this colloidal pesticide (LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm) is 1.7 to 2.1 times higher than that of its counterpart (CaCO3/Abm) prepared without LysCDs, which is attributed to the increased specific surface area and pore volume of LysCDs/CaCO3 particles. Due to the acid-induced degradation of CaCO3, the release of abamectin for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm is accelerated under weakly acidic conditions, which is accompanied by the release of Ca2+ ions and the fluorescence changes of LysCDs. The incorporation of LysCDs enhances the photostability and foliar adhesiveness of this colloidal pesticide, resulting in the highest degree of foliar retention when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or rainfall, compared to free-form abamectin and CaCO3/Abm. This results in the best performance of pest control on Plutella xylostella for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm in both indoor and outdoor tests. Nontarget biocompatibility evaluations show that LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm exhibits lower acute toxicity to zebrafish and earthworms than free-form abamectin. In addition, this colloidal pesticide is favored by the minimal residue of the adjuvant material after abamectin release, which is converted into harmless Ca2+ ions, CO2, and LysCDs. Therefore, this work designs a safer and more effective colloidal pesticide formulation to deliver abamectin with minimal adjuvant residue, realizing its trajectory as basically “circular and green”. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",NA,95

The Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary vector of DHF, has developed resistance to conventional chemical insecticides, necessitating the exploration of eco-friendly alternatives. Avocado seed (Persea americana) extract, rich in insecticidal compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, and saponins, presents a promising source for bioinsecticides. Granulated formulations offer advantages over liquid formulations, including enhanced stability, controlled release, and greater practicality in field applications. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the sustainable application of health management information systems and the role of health information technology strategies in supporting the continued use of such systems. Specifically, the focus is on the implementation of granulated bioinsecticide formulations derived from avocado seed extract as a sustainable solution for controlling Aedes aegypti larvae. Methods: An experimental laboratory study was conducted at the Phytochemical Pharmacy Laboratory, ITKES Muhammadiyah Sidrap, in September 2024. Granulated bioinsecticides were prepared from avocado seed extract and evaluated for their efficacy in controlling Aedes aegypti larvae. A total of 25 third-instar larvae were included in both experimental and control groups, with concentrations of 10, 15, 20, and 25 ppm administered. Larval mortality was assessed at 24 and 48-hour intervals. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, followed by post-hoc tests to determine significant differences. Results: The granulated bioinsecticide demonstrated a high level of efficacy, achieving a mortality rate of 94.2% at 25 ppm within 72 hours, compared to 58.5% at 10 ppm. ANOVA results indicated that both the concentration of the bioinsecticide and the exposure duration significantly affected larval mortality (p < 0.05). The granulated formulations exhibited prolonged effectiveness and a controlled release of active compounds, supporting their potential for large-scale applications. Conclusion: The granulated bioinsecticide formulated from avocado seed extract offers an eco-friendly and effective alternative for controlling Aedes aegypti larvae. The findings highlight its stability and scalability for use in vector control programs, contributing to sustainable public health initiatives. Further research should focus on optimizing the formulation, conducting field trials, and evaluating potential environmental impacts to maximize its practical applicability. © 2025 the Author(s).",NA,96

To better understand these processes, an accessible imaging-based experimental methodology is presented to precisely measure droplet spreading, evaporation, and potential uptake by a leaf within a controlled relative humidity environment. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effect of hydrocarbon surfactants, accelerators (light mineral oil), and humectants (high fructose corn syrup) on droplet spread, evaporation, and potential uptake when applied to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor ‘Tricker’) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) leaves. RESULTS: Experiments on cowpea leaves showed uniform spreading and no change in evaporation compared to the predicted rate. In contrast, on sorghum leaves, results suggest that the volume loss rate exceeds the predicted evaporation rate (up to 23%), indicating a potential uptake by the leaves. Some accelerated dynamics on sorghum can be attributed to the lateral spreading observed on hairy leaves along the veins, increasing the contact area by an average of 65%. However, samples containing light mineral oil, typically considered an accelerant to aid in uptake, demonstrated the highest rate but exhibited minimal spreading. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates how droplet composition affects droplet dynamics on waxy and hairy leaves by using an imaging-based methodology to measure evaporation rates, volume loss, contact angle, wetted area, and spreading behavior. The findings highlight some of the complex coupling between the crop protection product composition and droplet life cycle on a leaf. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study explores a novel approach using emamectin benzoate (EB) as a model pesticide, leveraging non-covalent molecular interactions to co-assemble nanocomplexes with cyclodextrin (β-CD) and polylactic acid (PLA) conjugates (β-CD-PLA-EB). Notably, these complexes were formulated without additional adjuvants. Optimal assembly occurred at an EB to β-CD to PLA ratio of 1:3, yielding stable beaded structures measuring 383.02 nm. These structures derive stability from electrostatic, hydrophobic, and π-π stacking interactions, ensuring excellent solubility and durability in aqueous environments. Importantly, the β-CD-PLA-EB formulation not only enhances the UV stability of EB but also extends its half-life significantly-nearly five times that of free EB. This formulation responds dynamically in alkaline conditions, intelligently releasing active ingredients within the alkaline intestinal microenvironment of lepidopteran pests. Rain-wash resistance tests demonstrated 50.03 % greater retention of β-CD-PLA-EB on corn leaves compared to EB WG suspension. Indoor and field trials further revealed enhanced residual activity and prolonged efficacy of β-CD-PLA-EB over EB WG, while also mitigating drug solution drift during application. Safety assessments indicated over a 26-fold reduction in acute toxicity to zebrafish compared to EB WG. These findings underscore β-CD-PLA-EB's potential as an advanced, environmentally sustainable solution for pesticide management, promising reduced environmental impact and enhanced efficacy. © 2025",NA,98

While these treatments are efficient for wood protection, leaching of both copper and azoles into the environment has deleterious impact on soils and surface waters. No bioremediation process is currently available for disposable of these wood wastes. Exploiting the natural ability of certain fungi to tolerate these active compounds, we propose that some ligninolytic fungi could serve as effective biocatalysts for detoxifying copper-azole formulations. Using the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium as a model, we demonstrated that these fungi engage multiple strategies to counteract the antifungal effect of azoles present in the preservatives. These include the modulation of the lipids and sterols content, the maintenance of DNA integrity, detoxification of azoles by extracellular degradation likely through the Fenton chemistry, biosorption at the cell wall, efflux, and intracellular detoxification by the three-step detoxification pathway. By using comparative transcriptomics between a copper-azole formulation and a copper-quaternary ammonium formulation, we identified genes specifically involved in azole resistance and detoxification within this complex system.

The knockdown due to VECTRON™ T500 was 7.08 % in the sixth month, while for Klypson 500 WG was 16.04-17.50 %. The monthly wall cone bioassay mortality with VECTRON™ T500 remained over 80 % for 6 months post-spraying for both laboratory and wild populations. The findings of this study have shown VECTRON™ T500 to have extended efficacy against malaria vector mosquitoes when applied to cement and mud walls. The evaluated new IRS formulation, VECTRON™ T500, performed equally with the positive control, Klypson 500 WG, regarding its impact on vector mortality. © 2024",NA,100

Herbicides with a longer retention and slow-release nature could allow Striga seeds to germinate and be killed before attaching to the host. Therefore, a graphene oxide based nanoformulation loaded with atrazine was synthesized and evaluated under controlled and field conditions for its release kinetics, Striga control efficiency (SCE), and cane yield for two years (2018–2019) at two locations. In-vitro assays on release kinetics showed that the release rate of active ingredient (a.i.) from the nanocomposite loaded with atrazine (NCA) was slower (64.5%) than conventional atrazine (82.1%) on the 30th day in water. Similarly, cumulative release percentage of a.i. with NCA was 4.4% compared to atrazine (16.2%) at the initial 0–3 days in soil. Further, field evaluation (deep application in 12 cm furrows) of NCA at 1.25 kg a.i./ha at 95 days after planting (DAP) found superior in delaying Striga emergence by 18–20 days over atrazine. Furthermore, NCA recorded the highest efficacy (∼ 21%) across two locations owing to reduced Striga density (66.7–68.2%) and dry weight (39.3–48.9%). Consequently, NCA at 95 DAP produced higher cane (30.6–31.0%) and sugar (30.7–36.7%) yields. Therefore, carbon-based graphene oxide with a greater surface area and low production cost would offer an environmentally benign and alternative option in controlling Striga before its haustorium attaches to sugarcane roots. This formulation represents a novel direction for developing herbicides with enhanced performance and reduced environmental impact. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,101

Using these drugs may cause irritation and adverse reactions. Moreover, there is a short exposure time to reach the lesion, which may result in low effectiveness of the treatment. Therefore, the research group aimed to develop mouthwash solutions that can form gel at oral temperature containing Zingiber zerumbet rhizome extracts, which work as an active substance inhibiting fungi. Methods: The development process began with the extraction of substances from Zingiber zerumbet rhizome using hexane and the analysis of the active substance by HPLC. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were evaluated. Hydrogel mouthwash was prepared by varying the type and concentration of polymer, solvent, and mucoadhesive agent. The optimized formulation was then evaluated for its properties. Results: Zingiber zerumbet rhizome extracts, containing 16.29±0.39 % zerumbone, demonstrated both antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities against Candida albicans. The extract also had anti-inflammatory activity when tested by the proteinase inhibitory test, with a percentage inhibition of 86.15±10.96 %. Two thermosensitive hydrogels, poloxamer P407 and P188, were applied and compared as gel-forming agents. It was found that the optimized formulation is composed of 15 % (w/w) poloxamer P407, 0.05 % (w/w) carbopol as a mucoadhesive agent, and 5 % (v/v) ethanol. Transition time and transition temperature of the optimized thermosensitive hydrogel formula were 27.76±1.25 s and 36±1.00 °C, respectively. The viscosity at shear rate 1 S-1 and 25 °C of the optimized formulation was 0.13±0.06 Pa.s, which is suitable for pouring out of the bottle and gargling. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a novel approach to developing thermosensitive hydrogel mouthwash formulations, leveraging Zingiber zerumbet rhizome extracts for enhanced therapeutic efficacy against oral candidiasis. These formulations offer prolonged contact time with affected areas, potentially improving treatment outcome. © 2024 The Author(s)",NA,102

Yet a limited number of insecticide classes are available for treating larval development sites for dipteran pest species. The most recently introduced class of insecticides in the United States (US) is the isoxazolines, including fluralaner. In the US, fluralaner is currently exclusively labeled for use against ectoparasites in companion animals. However, research has shown that it has a wider effective target range beyond ectoparasites and could be developed as an insecticide for vector control. Here we tested a novel, proprietary, yeast microencapsulated (YME) formulation of fluralaner against the larvae of three pest species: Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae), and Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). These species all naturally consume microorganisms as larvae, including yeasts. Fluralaner was successfully microencapsulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. YME fluralaner was reconstituted in water at concentrations of 0.00001–0.1 mg/mL (Aedes and Culicoides) or 1–50 mg/mL (Musca) for use in dose-response assays. For each species, the LC50 at 24 h was estimated using probit analyses. YME fluralaner was highly effective against all species tested (Ae. albopictus LC50 = 0.000077 mg/mL; C. sonorensis LC50 = 0.00067 mg/mL; M. domestica LC50 = 2.58 mg/mL). Additionally, laboratory assays were conducted to determine product reapplication rates using LC50 rates. Reapplication rates to maintain <50 % emergence were five weeks (Ae. albopictus) and greater than eight weeks (C. sonorensis). The results presented here indicate YME fluralaner is a promising candidate for controlling larval insects that naturally feed on detritus, thereby bypassing cuticular penetration barriers and safely delivering the active ingredient to the target species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,103

In recent decades, resistance of C. beticola to fungicides belonging to different groups of active substances has been described in many countries worldwide, including Hungary. The picolinamides are a new distinct group of fungal respiration inhibitors (QiI – FRAC Group 21) promise to be a good alternative in the management of fungicide resistance in crops. The florylpicoxamid fungicide were tested and evaluated over two seasons, in vegetation period of 2020 and 2021 for controlling CLS of sugar beet in Hungary. This fungicide was applied as straight formulated product at a range of dose rates, and they showed very effective control of CLS compared to the untreated control check plots and the reference fungicide products difenoconazole and epoxiconazole. All tested dose rates of florylpicoxamid provided effective control of against CLS of sugar beet. The area under the disease progress curve values (AUDPC) was significantly correlated with yield decrease, but AUPDC did not correlated with sugar content of the roots.

The near ubiquitous use of the broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate, in farming operations globally has necessitated a more expansive evaluation of the impacts of the agent itself and formulations containing glyphosate on important components of the plant phyllosphere, including Methylobacterium. This study provides an investigation of the sensitivity of 18 strains of Methylobacterium to glyphosate and two commercially available glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH). Nearly all strains of Methylobacterium showed signs of sensitivity to the popular GBH formulations WeatherMax® and Transorb® in a modified Kirby Bauer experiment. However, exposure to pure forms of glyphosate did not show a significant effect on growth for any strain in both the Kirby Bauer test and in liquid broth, until polysorbate-20 (Tween20) was added as a surfactant. Artificially increasing membrane permeability through the introduction of polysorbate-20 caused a 78–84% reduction in bacterial cell biomass relative to controls containing glyphosate or high levels of surfactant only (0–9% and 6–37% reduction respectively). Concentrations of glyphosate as low as 0.05% w/v (500 µg/L) from both commercial formulations tested, inhibited the culturability of Methylobacterium on fresh nutrient-rich medium. To better understand the compatibility of important phyllospheric bacteria with commercial glyphosate-based herbicides, this study endeavours to characterize sensitivity in multiple strains of Methylobacterium, and explore possible mechanisms by which toxicity may be induced. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,105

The excessive use of synthetic chemicals has resulted in the development of resistance to insecticides and negative consequences for the environment and insect biodiversity. Hence, three common weed species, namely Ageratum conyzoides, Chromolaena odorata, and Mallotus paniculatus, were evaluated on the comparative extraction yield in different solvents, as well as the toxicity potential in the selected methanol extract. Further, the bioactive compounds in C. odorata were characterized, and potential bio-insecticide formulations were developed and evaluated on the BPH. Methanol extract displayed higher efficiency, yielding 17.29% compared to only 3.19% in hexane extract. Insecticidal activity evaluation demonstrated that C. odorata exhibited the highest toxicity (77.50% at 10,000 ppm), having a median lethal concentration (LC50) value of 977 ppm, while A. conyzoides (55.20% at 10,000 ppm) and M. paniculatus (60.0% at 12,000 ppm) produced LC50 values of 6,549 ppm and 21,940 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, a plant-based bio-insecticide was formulated using the crude methanol extract of C. odorata as the active ingredient. A mixture of surfactant (Emersense® AM 8025), oil (palm kernel oil ester), and water resulted in a stable macroemulsion called Emersense® AM 8025/palm kernel oil ester/water (EM-PKOE). The formulated macroemulsion displayed enhanced toxicity and efficacy against BPH nymphs, with an LC50 value of 220 ppm, outperforming the unformulated crude methanol extract (977 ppm). Chemical composition analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that C. odorata primarily contained sesquiterpenes (24.14%).

Surfactants combine to form micelles that surround and break down or remove oils, making them ideal for detergents and cleaners. Two of the most important classes of nonionic surfactants are alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) and alcohol ethoxylates (AEOs). APEOs and AEOs are high production-volume chemicals that are used for many industrial and residential purposes, including laundry detergents, hard-surface cleaners, paints, and pesticide adjuvants. Commensurate with better appreciation of the toxicity of APEOs and the base alkylphenols, use of AEOs has increased, and both sets of compounds are now ubiquitous environmental contaminants. We recently demonstrated that diverse APEOs and AEOs induce triglyceride accumulation and/or preadipocyte proliferation in vitro. Both sets of contaminants have also been demonstrated as obesogenic and metabolism-disrupting in a developmental exposure zebrafish model. While these metabolic health effects are consistent across models and species, the mechanisms underlying these effects are less clear. This study sought to evaluate causal mechanisms through reporter gene assays, relative binding affinity assays, coexposure experiments, and use of both human cell and zebrafish models. We report that antagonism of thyroid hormone receptor signaling appears to mediate at least a portion of the polyethoxylate-induced metabolic health effects. These results suggest further evaluation is needed, given the ubiquitous environmental presence of these thyroid-disrupting contaminants and reproducible effects in human cell models and vertebrate animals. © The Author(s) 2024.

The aim of the study was to assess the sorption capacity of microplastics that were present in both untreated and aged form using standard and modified Fenton methods. In addition, impact on toxicity and stress adaptation of the model soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was measured. Upon ageing, ABS microplastics underwent a fivefold increase in BET surface area and total pore volume (from 0.001 to 0.004 cm3/g) which lead to a dramatic increase in adsorption of the cations on ABS microplastics from 40 to 45% for virgin ABS to 75–80% for aged ABS. Toxicity was mainly attributed to hydrophobic cations in ILs (EC50 ∼ 60–65 mg/dm3), which was also mitigated by sorption on ABS. Furthermore, both cations and anions behaved similarly across different ILs, corresponding chlorides, and substrates used in the ILs synthesis. These findings highlight microplastics potential as hazardous sorbents, contributing to the accumulation of xenobiotics in the environment. © 2024 The Authors",NA,111

While regulatory risk assessments primarily focus on the active ingredients, recent research indicates ecotoxicological impacts of commercial preparations on non-target organisms, particularly within the soil ecosystem where key species such as earthworms play a vital role in maintaining soil quality and fertility. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the long-term effects of the following respective commercial preparations: the insecticides Sumialfa (esfenvalerate) and Calypso (thiacloprid), as well as the herbicides Frontier (dimethenamid-p) and Filon (prosulfocarb) on the earthworm Eisenia andrei in standardized soil during long-term exposures of 7, 14, and 28 days. To study the possible effects on different levels of biological organization, enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES) glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx); non-enzymatic biomarkers: multixenobiotic resistance activity (MXR), levels of glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as reproductive success were investigated. While Calypso appeared to be the least toxic substance, all pesticides showed significant effect on multiobiomarker response in E. fetida. That being said, the response of MXR activity was significantly altered by all tested pesticides indicating MXR being the most sensitive endpoint of the present research. Recovery of MXR was observed after 28 days, however, only in case of exposure to Filon, while the recovery of CAT activity was recorded after 28 days as well, subsequent to Sumialfa exposure. Reproductive success was negatively impacted regarding the Frontier and Sumialfa exposure at the highest concentration (100 mg/kg) reflected in reduced number of cocoons, while only the exposure to Frontier (100 mg/kg) reduced the number of juveniles. Based on the results, it is important to include commercial pesticide formulations in pesticide risk assessments. The toxicity classifications of the studied pesticides suggest the potential detrimental consequences to the key soil species in terrestrial ecosystems at various concentrations. Future studies should include other soil species as well as investigation of higher levels of biological organization, i.e., behavioral endpoints, to determine the potential risks to terrestrial ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,112

Bacteria were isolated from potato and strawberry plants, and their respective rhizosphere soils. The bacterial isolates were subjected to antifungal activity testing. Twenty-four of the isolates with antifungal activity were further subjected to an antifungal activity assay against Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria alternata, and Fusarium oxysporum. These bacterial isolates were identified using microscopic, phenotypic, and biochemical tests. The identity of the four bacteria with strong antifungal activity was confirmed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 374 strains of bacteria were isolated, with 24 having antagonistic activity.

Currently, herbicides are primarily applied for weed management. However, the effectiveness of herbicide deposition and uptake on barnyardgrass is limited as a consequence of the high wax content on leaves, low water solubility and extreme lipophilicity of herbicides. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel formulations for efficient delivery of herbicides to improve herbicidal activity and reduce dosage. RESULTS: We successfully prepared nanosuspension(s) (NS) of quinclorac through the wet media milling technique. This NS demonstrates excellent physical stability and maintains nanoscale during dose transfer. The deposition concentration and uptake concentration of NS on barnyardgrass were 3.84–4.47- and 2.11–2.58-fold greater than those traditional formulations, respectively. Moreover, the NS exhibited enhanced herbicidal activity against barnyardgrass at half the dosage required by conventional formulations without compromising rice safety. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that NS can effectively facilitate the delivery of hydrophobic and poorly water-soluble herbicide active ingredients, thereby enhancing their deposition, uptake and bioactivity. This study expands the potential application of NS in pesticide delivery, which can provide valuable support for optimizing pesticide utilization, improving economic efficiency and mitigating environmental risks. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,114

This review provides a state of the art of this quickly developing area from the material design perspective and examines cocrystallized products for emerging applications in sustainable agriculture, such as novel fertilizer formulations that incorporate essential nutrients, as well as cocrystals for other applications, such as pest control. The chemical and crystal structures, bonding mechanisms, and the resulting properties of these cocrystals are discussed. Special attention is given to urea-based cocrystals.

The results showed that the optimum formulation for P. lilacinum ZJPL08 wettable powder (WP) was as follows: 10.00% conidial spore powder of ZJPL08 (active ingredient), 3.00% sodium dodecyl sulfate (wetting agent), 5.00% sodium lignosulfonate (dispersant), 0.25% humic acid (UV protectant), 0.10% CaCl2 (promoter of spore germination), 0.05% xanthan gum (adhesive), and 81.60% diatomite (carrier). Under these conditions, the P. lilacinum ZJPL08 WP achieved a spore concentration of 3.25×1010 spores/g, a suspension rate of 85.67%, a wetting time of 86.22 s, a fineness of 95.39% powder passing through a 300 mesh sieve and a pH value of 6.65; all the indexes met the requirements of national pesticide formulation products. The semi-field control efficiency test results showed that the 1 500-fold dilution of P. lilacinum ZJPL08 WP could effectively control D. citri, with a control efficiency of 97.78%, which was not significantly different from the 1 000-fold dilution of the control insecticide, 30% thiamethoxam WP (100% control efficiency), but was significantly greater than the 1 500-fold dilution of 1.80% avemectin emulsion (78.33% control efficiency). In conclusion, the P. lilacinum ZJPL08 WP developed in this study presented excellent control efficiency for D. citri, which probably has important application prospects in replacing chemical pesticides. © 2024 Zhejiang University.

Specifically, triazole fungicides are widely used in agriculture to manage fungal diseases and are known to disrupt mammalian CYP450 and liver microsomal enzymes. This research establishes a framework for risk characterization of human exposure to triazole fungicides by internal-dose biomonitoring, biochemical marker measurements, and integration of high-throughput screening (HTS) data via computational toxicology workflows from the Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE). Volunteers from the southern region of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were divided into two groups: farmworkers and spouses occupationally and environmentally exposed to pesticides from rural areas (n = 140) and individuals from the urban area to serve as a comparison group (n = 50). Three triazole fungicides, cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and triadimenol, were detected in the urine samples of both men and women in the rural group. Androstenedione and testosterone hormones were significantly reduced in the farmworker group (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001). The data show a significant inverse association of testosterone with cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides, and glucose and a direct association with HDL (Spearman's correlation, p < 0.05). In the ICE workflow, active in vitro HTS assays were identified for the three measured triazoles and three other active ingredients from the pesticide formulations. The curated HTS data confirm bioactivities predominantly related to steroid hormone metabolism, cellular stress processes, and CYP450 enzymes impacted by fungicide exposure at occupationally and environmentally relevant concentrations based on the in vitro to in vivo extrapolation models. These results characterize the potentially significant human health risk, particularly from the high frequency and intensity of exposure to epoxiconazole. This study showcases the critical role of biomonitoring and utility of computational tools in evaluating pesticide exposure and minimizing the risk. © 2024",NA,117

This study specifically developed nanoemulsions of frankincense, turmeric, and sesame oil to assess their impact on paddy rice. Notably, there is a lack of research examining both the efficacy and long-term effects of nanoemulsion treatments on rice quality, as most existing studies focus primarily on immediate harmful effects or repellent capabilities without considering prolonged impacts. This research is pioneering in exploring how nanoemulsion treatments influence the physical and chemical properties, nutritional value, and overall quality of paddy rice, as well as their effects on the rice weevil, (Sitophilus oryzae L., Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Nanoemulsions were prepared using a high-energy ultrasonication process and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, revealing spherical particles ranging from 27 to 34 nm in diameter. The formulations exhibited kinetic stability, slight acidity (pH 5.0–6.33), and favorable physicochemical properties including zeta potential (−31.6 to −15.2 mV), viscosity (27–34 cP), and surface tension (28.12–53.59 dyne/cm). The nanoemulsions were applied to paddy rice of the Sakha 108 cultivar at concentrations of 500, 1500, and 2000 μL/kg. Over 9 months of storage, the sesame nanoemulsion at 2000 μL/kg significantly improved milling quality (71.78% vs 70.23% in controls), hardness (7.25 N vs 5.40 N), and cooking properties. It also enhanced nutritional content, increasing vitamin B3 to 51.12 mg/kg (vs 44.63 mg/kg in controls), potassium to 1149 mg/kg (vs 1113 mg/kg), and phosphorus to 1133 mg/kg (vs 1064 mg/kg). The nanoemulsions demonstrated robust insecticidal effects against S. oryzae. The turmeric formulation at 2000 μL/kg achieved 100% adult mortality after two weeks and complete inhibition of progeny emergence over 9 months. Sesame and frankincense nanoemulsions at the same concentration resulted in 90% and 83.33% mortality, respectively, after two weeks. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanoemulsion technology as an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical treatments for maintaining rice quality and providing effective pest control during long-term storage. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,118

Pesticides like the herbicide glyphosate have garnered considerable attention due to their well-documented harmful effects on non-target species. During application, the active ingredient glyphosate is utilized in various formulations, each containing different additive adjuvants. However, the possible effects of these formulations on amphibians - the group with the highest decline rates among vertebrates - remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of four glyphosate formulations (Glyphosat TF, Durano TF, Helosate 450 TF, Kyleo) on the embryonic development of the model organism Xenopus laevis (South African clawed frog). Embryos at the 2-cell stage were exposed to various concentrations of glyphosate formulations (glyphosate: 0.01–100 mg/L), and mortality as well as sublethal effects on different organs and tissues were analyzed. The results indicated that the formulations had different effects, particularly on the mortality of Xenopus laevis embryos. At sublethal concentrations, the formulations altered the embryos' external appearance, leading to malformations such as reduced eye and head size. In addition, exposure to formulations impaired heart morphology and function, and the expression of heart-specific genes was altered at a molecular level. Our results confirmed that glyphosate formulations had a stronger effect on Xenopus laevis embryogenesis than pure glyphosate. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the active ingredient and the co-formulations independently, as well as the combined, commercially available products, during pesticide risk assessments and renewal procedures of agrochemicals. The severe global decline of amphibians, partly due to herbicide use, highlights the need for strict and efficient monitoring of environmental pesticide loads and application areas. © 2024 The Authors",NA,119

We evaluated ecotoxicological endpoints, behavioral and developmental alterations, and the biochemical detoxifying, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress responses, covering a wide concentration range from environmental to high application levels. Both pyrethroid preparations displayed similar ecotoxicity (median lethal concentration of ~0.5 mg/L), with the lethal effect of Zero® being more pronounced than that of the active ingredient. Sublethal behavioral alterations in natatory activity were observed at 1000 times lower concentrations, indicating the ecological hazard of tadpole exposure to this pyrethroid at environmentally relevant concentrations. Biochemical endpoints in B. pulchella larvae showed significant responses to lambda-cyhalothrin in the ng/L range; these responses were different for the pure or the formulated product, and they were variable at higher concentrations. Principal components analysis confirmed the prevalence of biochemical responses as early endpoints at the lowest lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations; the Integrated Biomarker Response Index proportionally increased with pyrethroid concentration in a similar way for the pure and the formulated products. We conclude that lambda-cyhalothrin is of concern from an environmental perspective, with particular emphasis on autochthonous anuran development. The battery of biochemical biomarkers included in our study showed a consistent integrated biomarker response, indicating that this is a potent tool for monitoring impacts on amphibians.

Pesticide adjuvants (PAs) are added to pesticides but can be as toxic as pesticides’ active ingredients. Ongoing experiments have identified sodium alginate (SA) as a drift-reducing PA less toxic to honeybees. Hence, SA and fenugreek polymer (FP) have been tested as drift-reducing PAs for aerial applications using the Remotely Piloted Aerial Application System (RPAAS). Two spray experiments were carried out in the field: (i) water only (W) and (ii) water and adjuvant (WA). Droplet spectrum and on-target coverage were collected using a VisiSize P15 image analyzer and kromekote cards, respectively. The drift reduction potentials (DRPs) of the adjuvants were analyzed based on droplet size (diameters of 10%, 50%, and 90% volume) and the proportion of driftable volume with droplets < 200 µm. Compared to the W only, the W-A treatment produced larger droplets, suggesting the presence of DRP. There were 14.5%, 8.3% to 14.4%, and 2.3% to 7.7% driftable fines in the W, WA (SA), and WA (FP) treatments, respectively. The FP treatment improved the on-target coverage (3.0% to 3.1%) compared to water (2.7%).

In this study, we investigated the physicochemical properties of bio-based nanoemulsions (CNs) containing several concentrations of caraway (Carum carvi) essential oil stabilized with Eco Tween 80, as a surfactant, maintaining 1:1 proportions. Detailed physicochemical characteristics of the CNs revealed that their properties were most desired at 2% of the oil and surfactant, i.e., the smallest droplet size, polydispersity index, and viscosity. The CNs caused biochemical changes in maize and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) seedlings, however, to a different extent. Barnyard grass has overall metabolism (measured as a thermal power) decreased by 39–82% when exposed to the CNs. The CNs triggered changes in the content and composition of carbohydrates in the endosperm of both species' seedlings in a dose–response manner. The foliar application of CNs caused significant damage to tissues of young maize and barnyard grass plants. The effective dose of the CN (ED50, causing a 50% damage) was 5% and 17.5% oil in CN for barnyard grass and maize tissues, respectively. Spraying CNs also decreased relative water content in leaves and affected the efficiency of photosynthesis by disturbing the electron transport chain. We found that barnyard grass was significantly more susceptible to the foliar application of CNs than maize, which could be used to selectively control this species in maize crops. However, further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis under field conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,122

A micellar solution of Poloxamer 407 was selected as a cosmetic base because of the good washing ability, easy application, and high tolerability of this polymeric surfactant. The solubilization capacity of a 5% micellar solution with respect to α-bisabolol was investigated by applying varying solubilization techniques and increasing concentrations of the oily active substance. The test samples were subjected to an accelerated physical stability test, viscosimetry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), foamability test, and antimicrobial screening. Over the course of this research, the advantage of the film-hydration method over direct solubilization was demonstrated by the narrower size distribution and smaller hydrodynamic size of the micellar nano-carriers (ranging from 29.02 to 116.5 nm) and the respective higher physical stability of the dispersions. The optimized composition was found to be suitable for application on large skin areas in terms of viscosity in the temperature range from 20 °C to 40 °C (3.4–2.3 mPa.s). Preservation of the washing capacity of the micellar solution in the presence of solubilized α-bisabolol was established. The active composition demonstrated inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and fungicidal activity against Candida albicans. This study concludes that the optimal concentration of α-bisabolol to be solubilized in a 5% Poloxamer 407 micellar solution by the film-hydration technique is 1%, considering the desirable physical endurance and antimicrobial activity. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,123

Managing the disease with fungicides can harm health and the environment and can lead to the selection of pathogens resistant to their active ingredients. The use of essential oils (EOs) represents an alternative control method due to their richness in antimicrobial compounds, such as rosemary EO (Rosmarinus officinalis). However, the high volatility of several components of these oils makes commercial use difficult, and nanoencapsulation presents a technology to increase stability. In the present study, three formulations containing rosemary EO—nanoemulsion (NE), nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), and nanocapsules with chitosan (NC)—were evaluated on strawberry fruits and against the fungus. The nanoformulations retained their characteristics (mean values: size 142 nm; polydispersity index 0.131; pH 4.99; zeta potential -20.2 mV for NE and NLC, and 19.1 mV for NC) when stored at 40 °C for 60 days. All nanoformulations had a direct effect on spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea, possibly due to damage caused to the cell wall and plasma membrane, and changes in the pathogen's oxidative balance. NE containing 2 % EO, when applied by immersion, reduced the incidence and severity of the disease by around 40 % and 70 %, respectively, 6 days after treatment. The fruits treated with this formulation maintained their physicochemical characteristics for longer. Thus, the use of rosemary oil from NE can be an option for managing gray mold and increasing the shelf life of the fruits. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,124

The analytical parameters that affect the sensitivity of the DME and RME-PIF methods were optimized. Fenvalerate exhibited a primary excitation and emission band in the 278–317 nm and 325–365 nm regions, respectively. The optimum pH conditions for each medium are as follows: water and Brij-700 (pH = 12), CTAOH (pH = 10), CTAC (pH = 8), SDS (pH = 7). However, the optimal irradiation time varies between 2 and 14 min depending on the solvent. The micellar association constant (Km) of surfactants was determined at different temperatures (298 to 348 K). The Km values increase with temperature, indicating more favorable micellization at higher temperatures. In all cases, a negative value of ΔG° was obtained, indicating that the association reactions of fenvalerate with the surfactants used are spontaneous. Additionally, the RME-PIF method was used to establish the calibration curves of fenvalerate in all micellar media including CTAOH-CH3CN. The linearity of the calibration curves was evaluated by variance analysis (p-value ≤ 5 %), which indicates a significant regression. The RME-PIF method showed significantly enhanced sensitivity with LOD values ranging from 0.006 to 48 ng mL−1. The mixture CTAOH-CH3CN produced the lowest LOD value (0.006 ng mL−1). The SPE procedure yielded satisfactory recovery rates varying between 84.2 and 104.3 % in natural waters.

European legislation mandates that chemical manufacturers provide data for the environmental risk assessment of substances to obtain registration. Endocrine disruptors, substances that interfere with the hormone system, are not granted marketing authorization due to their adverse effects. Current methods for identifying disruptors targeting the thyroid hormone system are costly and require many amphibians. Consequently, alternative methods compliant with the 3R principle (replacement, reduction, refinement) are essential to prioritize risk assessment using reliable biomarkers at non-protected life stages. Our study focused on detecting robust biomarkers for thyroid-disrupting mechanisms of action (MoA) by analyzing molecular signatures in zebrafish embryos induced by deiodinase inhibitor iopanoic acid and thyroid peroxidase inhibitor methimazole. We exposed freshly fertilized zebrafish eggs to these compounds, measuring lethality, hatching rate, swim bladder size and transcriptomic responses. Both compounds significantly reduced swim bladder size, aligning with prior findings. Transcriptome analysis revealed specific molecular fingerprints consistent with the MoA under investigation. This analysis confirmed regulation directions seen in other studies involving thyroid disruptors and allowed us to identify genes like tg, scl2a11b, guca1d, cthrc1a, si:ch211-226h7.5, soul5, nnt2, cox6a2 and mep1a as biomarker genes for thyroid disrupting MoA in zebrafish embryos as per OECD test guideline 236. Future screening methods based on our findings will enable precise identification of thyroid-related activity in chemicals, promoting the development of environmentally safer substances. Additionally, these biomarkers could potentially be incorporated into legally mandated chronic toxicity tests in fish, potentially replacing amphibian tests for thyroid disruption screening in the future. © 2024 The Authors",NA,126

Fluralaner (Bravecto®) is a novel acaricide that has recently been utilised for treating mange in wombats. The topical ‘spot-on’ formulation of fluralaner can limit treatment delivery options in situ, but dilution to a volume for ‘pour-on’ delivery is one practicable solution. This study investigated the in vitro acaricidal activity of Bravecto, a proposed essential oil-based diluent (Orange Power®), and two of its active constituents, limonene and citral, against Sarcoptes scabiei. Methods: Sarcoptes scabiei were sourced from experimentally infested pigs. In vitro assays were performed to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) and survival time of the mites when exposed to varying concentrations of the test solutions. Results: All compounds were highly effective at killing mites in vitro. The LC50 values of Bravecto, Orange Power, limonene and citral at 1 h were 14.61 mg/ml, 4.50%, 26.53% and 0.76%, respectively. The median survival times of mites exposed to undiluted Bravecto, Orange Power and their combination were 15, 5 and 10 min, respectively. A pilot survival assay of mites collected from a mange-affected wombat showed survival times of < 10 min when exposed to Bravecto and Orange Power and 20 min when exposed to moxidectin. Conclusions: These results confirm the acaricidal properties of Bravecto, demonstrate acaricidal properties of Orange Power and support the potential suitability of Orange Power and its active constituents as a diluent for Bravecto. As well as killing mites via direct exposure, Orange Power could potentially enhance the topical delivery of Bravecto to wombats by increasing drug penetration in hyperkeratotic crusts. Further research evaluating the physiochemical properties and modes of action of Orange Power and its constituents as a formulation vehicle would be of value.

Antimicrobial activity was determined in in-vitro tests where pure TPEO successfully inhibited the development of different Phytophthora species.

FTIR spectra analysis confirmed the formation of electrostatic interaction between these polymers, and hydrogen interactions between active components of TPEO and polymer chains. The stability of the emulsions was confirmed by zeta potential measurements, with a value of about 30 mV, even after 14 days of aging. UV‐Vis spectra analysis revealed that >60 % of TPEO remained in the emulsion after 14 days of exposure to ambient conditions, whereas pure TPEO evaporated faster, and around 20 % remained after 6 days. Encapsulated TPEO almost completely inhibited the growth of Phytophthora species during the ten-day day's exposition being statistically significantly improved compared to fungicide treatment. It was demonstrated that the emulsion exhibited a prolonged antimicrobial effect and successfully suppressed the growth of Phytophthora species, and can be considered as a means of protection in forests and crops. © 2024",NA,128

Currently, multiple formulations of 2,4-D and dicamba are available on the market. Even though the active ingredient is the same, the chemical formulation may vary, which can influence the volatility potential of these herbicides. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the response of soybean, cotton, and tobacco plants exposed to vapors of 2,4-D and dicamba formulations alone or mixed in humidomes for 24 h. Humidome studies were conducted in an open pavilion at the Lake Wheeler Turfgrass Field Lab of the North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. Dicamba and mixture treatments injured and caused a reduction in the height of soybean. Injury varied from 55% to 70%, and average plant height was 8.8 cm shorter compared with untreated control plants. Treatments with 2,4-D caused the least injury to soybean (≤21%), and differences among formulations were identified (dimethylamine > choline > dimethylamine-monomethylamine). However, soybean height was not affected by 2,4-D treatments. No differences between treatments were observed when herbicides were applied to cotton. The greatest injury to tobacco (23.3%) was caused by dicamba dimethylamine. Overall, the effect of 2,4-D and dicamba vapor was species-specific and formulation-dependent. Additionally, environmental conditions in the humidomes may have played a major role on the outcome of this study.  © The Author(s), 2023.

BCT/SB-LDH-LAP, BCT/DCB-LDH-LAP, BCT/SB-DCB-LDH-LAP and IMP/DCB-LDH-LAP had larger interlayer distances of 4.29, 4.33, 4.33 and 4.61 nm, which were bigger than those of SB-LDH-LAP (3.87 nm), DCB-LDH-LAP (3.83 nm) and LDH-LAP (1.65 nm). The FT-IR and TGA/DTA results further confirmed the existence of SB, DCB, BCT and IMP into LDH-LAP. The pesticide releases were investigated and analyzed in pH 5.0 and 6.8 buffer solutions. The release behaviors can be fitted by pseudo second-order and parabolic diffusion models. The composites based on LDH-LAP could be suggested to potential application for controlled-release of the pesticide. © 2024",NA,131

In the current study, the sublethal effects of deltamethrin, λ-cyhalothrin, α-cypermethrin, etofenprox, and the mixture of acetamiprid with d-tetramethrin and piperonyl butoxide on the mobility of O. surinamensis in the presence or the absence of a food source was investigated. RESULTS: Lethal concentrations (LCs) were lower for deltamethrin, α-cypermethrin, and λ-cyhalothrin (LC10 = 0.000233, 0.000211, and 0.000271 mg active ingredient (a.i.) cm−2, LC30 = 0.000413, 0.000398, and 0.000447 mg a.i. cm−2, respectively), followed by etofenprox, and the mixture of acetamiprid with d-tetramethrin and piperonyl butoxide (LC10 = 0.00228 and 0.003267 mg a.i. cm−2, LC30 = 0.00437 and 0.01188 mg a.i. cm−2, respectively). Deltamethrin and λ-cyhalothrin negatively impacted adult walking behavior, increasing stop durations compared to controls. Adults exposed to LC10 and LC30 of λ-cyhalothrin, and LC30 of deltamethrin exhibited prolonged periods on their backs compared to the remaining treatments and the controls. The α-cypermethrin LC30-exposed adults exhibited significantly shorter walking and stopping durations than controls but demonstrated prolonged climbing on the arena walls compared to adults exposed to the remaining a.i. and the control. A similar trend was observed for etofenprox. CONCLUSIONS: Under sublethal concentrations, λ-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin increased stop intervals and reduced the duration of climbing attempts of O. surinamensis versus α-cypermethrin. These findings advance comprehension of the underexplored sublethal impacts of the tested a.i. on O. surinamensis adults, holding potential for leveraging insecticide-induced behavioral effects to enhance warehouse pest management. © 2024 The Author(s).

Due to its low solubility in aqueous media, high volatility, and a high propensity for physicochemical degradation, the search for nanostructured systems to promote the stability of this phytocomplex is necessary. Nanoemulsion is an alternative method to stabilize and preserve this type of active ingredient, especially when generated by a low energy method and using Syagrus coronata (licuri) oil as an active carrier and stabilizer of this nanostructure. The objective of the present investigation was to formulate a stable nanoemulsion with Lippia origanoides essential oil carried through licuri oil with antifungal action by the low energy method. For this, we began with the extraction of the essential oil and the phytochemical characterization obtaining the chemotype B of this Lippia (carvacrol: 49.12%). Then, using the pseudoternary phase diagram, the optimal ratio of the oil phase 6:4 (essential oil: Syagrus coronata oil) was established, adding 15% of surfactant (polysorbate 80) and 75% of the aqueous phase. Then, with the formulated nanoemulsion, the physical-chemical characterization and evaluation of preliminary and accelerated stability were carried out. In addition, cytotoxicity, Franz cell permeation and antifungal activity against dermatophytes were evaluated. A stable nanoemulsion was obtained by the low energy method with the characteristic appearance of a nanoemulsion and a characteristic odor of essential oil. The average size of the nanoparticles was around 167.5 nm, narrow PDI (<0.2 nm), zeta potential below −10.0 mV, acidic pH (5.1), average conductivity 134.4 μSm/cm, refractive index characteristic of a translucent system and low viscosity (<6.0 mPa.S). Regarding cytotoxicity, it proved to be safe at dosages below 90 μg/mL, efficient in terms of permeation (76.7% in 24h) and effective in terms of antifungal activity as it had a minimum inhibitory concentration between 234.4/156.3 μg/mL and 11.2/7.5 μg/mL against the tested dermatophytes. In view of the results, a nanoemulsion containing the essential oil of L. origanoides carried by the oil of Syagrus coronata was shown to be a potential product for the topical treatment of fungal infections like dermatophytosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,133

Argentina is one of the main producers and exporters of corn globally. Post-harvest pests, such as the insect Sitophilus zeamais, can cause losses of more than 10%, representing a very important negative economic impact on the industry. For pest control many synthetic insecticides are used. Nevertheless, these insecticides show toxicity to mammals and environmental contamination and cause resistance. For this, there is a constant need to introduce new substances used in the protection of crops and the plant extracts and their volatile products are an interesting alternative. In this work we evaluate the effectiveness of natural VACs for the control of S. zeamais and the prolonged effect of the more toxic alcohol incorporated in a paint on its survival. 1-heptyn-3-ol was the most toxic alcohol tested (LC50 = 0.74 μL/L). In the presence of food, the fumigant toxicity of 1-heptyn-3-ol was lower (LC50 = 14.73 μL/L). Also, the non-phytotoxic effect of 1-heptyn-3-ol was determined. When the 1-heptyn-3-ol was included in the polyvinyl paint, the toxic effect was prolongated in the time, causing even 80% mortality at 14th day. Regarding the repellent effect of 1-heptyn-3-ol, it was observed that this alcohol included in the bioactive paint, in the presence of food, presented a repellency similar to that determined for the pure compound, in the absence of food, and greater than the repellency determined for the pure compound in the presence of food. In conclusion, compounds such as 1-hetpyn-3-ol is a potential candidate for insecticidal formulations that allow adequate management of S. zeamais in stored grain.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the CRFs. FTIR and XRD spectral data provide evidence for pesticide-matrix interactions fundamental to observed matrix surface binding and pesticide release behaviour in water and soil environments. Properties evaluation of the CRFs reveal similar magnitudes of loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of CDA- and STA-based CRFs of both pesticides, while the order CDA > STA prevails in matrix porosity and swelling ability. Technical grade (TG) and the CRF-encapsulated pesticides exhibit “burst” release profiles in water; pesticide quantities released at similar lengths of time follow the order TG >> STA-CRF > CDA-CRF, thus revealing the capacity of the CRFs to constrain the active ingredients from free mobility, with CDA-CRF being the more slightly efficacious. The Korsmeyer-Peppas equation reasonably models pesticide release from both CRFs into water, giving n values consistent with both water diffusion into the matrix and matrix relaxation as kinetically important in both matrices. Soil column experiments demonstrate the potential of the CFRs to mitigate ground water pollution. Overall, the results show that CDA- and STA-based CRFs of both pesticides have roughly the same potency for pesticide controlled release and ground water pollution mitigation. Deployment of these CFRs can contribute to the drive for agro-environmental sustainability, while the use of CDA, a waste material, as a matrix in controlled pesticide delivery would resonate with sustainable bioresource utilization. © 2024 The Authors",NA,135

Calibrating the PT can be time-consuming, and the dosing of surfaces may not be as accurate or uniform as previously assumed. Methods: To address these limitations, the Micron Horizontal Track Sprayer with Spray Cabinet (TS) was developed to provide higher efficiency, ease of operation and deposition uniformity equal to or better than the PT. A series of studies were performed using a fluorescent tracer and three IRS formulations (Actellic® 300CS, K-Othrine WG250 and Suspend PolyZone) sprayed onto surfaces using either the PT or the TS. Results: Deposition volumes could be accurately calibrated for both spray systems. However, the uniformity of spray deposits was higher for the TS compared to the PT. Less than 12% of the volume sprayed using the PT reaches the target surface, with the remaining 88% unaccounted for, presumably vented out of the fume hood or coating the internal surfaces of the tower. In contrast, the TS deposits most of the spray on the floor of the spray chamber, with the rest contained therein. The total sprayed surface area in one run of the TS is 1.2 m2, and the operational zone for spray target placement is 0.7 m2, meaning that 58% of the applied volume deposits onto the targets. The TS can treat multiple surfaces (18 standard 15 × 15 cm tiles) in a single application, whereas the PT treats one surface at a time and a maximum area of around 0.0225 m2. An assessment of the time taken to perform spraying, including the setup, calibration and cleaning, showed that the cost of application using the TS was around 25–35 × less per tile sprayed. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for calibration and use of both the Potter Tower and Track Sprayer have been developed. Conclusions: Overall, the TS represents a significant improvement over the PT in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of IRS formulation applications onto test substrates and offers a useful additional tool for researchers and manufacturers wanting to screen new active ingredients or evaluate the efficacy of IRS or other sprayable formulations for insect control.

In light of current environmental concerns, organic products have gained popularity, with essential oils emerging as potential natural herbicides. A systematic review of 100 studies from 2000 to 2024 highlights increasing interest in weed control through essential oils, particularly in Europe. Eighteen studies included in meta-analysis revealed that essential oil treatments significantly reduced weed shoot and root length and weight, achieving 45–92% growth control. Key terpenes such as 1,8-Cineole, ρ-Cymene, and α-Pinene were identified as the primary phytotoxic compounds. Modifying formulations through encapsulation and emulsification enhanced the stability, efficacy, and retention time of essential oils. The meta-analysis indicated moderate to high heterogeneity (I2 values of 0.58 and 0.98), attributed to factors like active compounds, weed species, climatic conditions, and assay types. The review concludes that further in-depth studies are necessary to develop sustainable, eco-friendly herbicides from essential oils. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",NA,137

The information was collected through a systematic search in Research Gate, Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed, using keywords such as production, Beauveria bassiana, solid fermentation, liquid fermentation and metabolites. The results affirm that B. bassiana is one of the microorganisms with great potential to produce biopesticides, due to the entomopathogenic mechanism of action and secondary metabolites, which can be used for the biological control of phytophagous insects. Likewise, for the formulation of B. bassiana it should be considered a profitable culture medium for large-scale production, also the control of environmental variables such as temperature at 25 ◦C, relative humidity 65-70%, pH of 5.4, propagation time between 4 to 8 days, and for the liquid fermentation process, a constant agitation between 200 to 400 rpm must be maintained.

It damages plants by secreting large amounts of oxalic acid and cell wall-degrading enzymes. To meet this challenge, we designed a new pH/enzyme dual-responsive nanopesticide Pro@ZnO@Pectin (PZP). This nanopesticide uses zinc oxide (ZnO) as a carrier of prochloraz (Pro) and is encapsulated with pectin. When encountering oxalic acid released by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the acidic environment promotes the decomposition of ZnO; at the same time, the pectinase produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can also decompose the outer pectin layer of PZP, thereby promoting the effective release of the active ingredient. Experimental data showed that PZP was able to achieve an efficient release rate of 57.25% and 68.46% when pectinase was added or under acidic conditions, respectively. In addition, in vitro tests showed that the antifungal effect of PZP was comparable to that of the commercial Pro (Pro SC) on the market, and its efficacy was 1.40 times and 1.32 times that of the Pro original drug (Pro TC), respectively. Crucially, the application of PZP significantly alleviated the detrimental impacts of Pro on wheat development. Soil wetting experiments have proved that PZP primarily remained in the soil, thereby decreasing its likelihood of contaminating water sources and reducing potential risks to non-target organisms. Moreover, PZP improved the foliar wettability of Pro, lowering the contact angle to 75.06°. Residue analyses indicated that PZP did not elevate prochloraz residue levels in tomato fruits compared to conventional applications, indicating that the nanopesticide formulation does not lead to excessive pesticide buildup. In summary, the nanopesticide PZP shows great promise for effectively managing Sclerotinia sclerotiorum while minimizing environmental impact. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,141

In this work, two biosurfactant extracts were produced successfully at a pilot scale using CSL. One was more hydrophobic and was obtained through liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate (BS-ACT). The other was more hydrophilic, obtained through solid–liquid extraction with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (BS-PBS). RESULTS: The biosurfactant extracts (BS-ACT and BS-PBS) were included in biocide formulations to assess their impact on enhancing the suspensibility and solubility of different metallic active substances. The BS-PBS extract exhibited superior properties in suspending biocides in comparison with BS-ACT, despite BS-ACT demonstrating a higher solubility capacity. Moreover, in comparison with chemical surfactants, BS-ACT displayed significantly greater ability to solubilize biocides in water, whereas BS-PBS showed suspensibility results that were comparable with synthetic surfactants.

Globally, more than 2000 commercial GLY-based herbicides (GBHs) are used to control weeds. Non-target organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real environmental conditions, but the co-formulants contained in GBHs are classified as so-called inert and inactive ingredients in terms of their biological effects. The main objective of this comprehensive review is to compile the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies on the side-effects of GLY, GBHs, and their formulating agents. Based on the results demonstrated for a variety of plant and animal aquatic organisms, oxidative stress appears to be a major trigger for these adverse effects, affecting the integrity of DNA and other biochemical functions. Furthermore, there is evidence of impairment of various physiological and behavioral functions. Adverse effects of GLY and GBHs have been observed even at very low concentrations. There are also differences in the sensitivity of the aquatic organisms tested, even with similar lifestyles, habitats or identical taxa. The studies typically investigate the short-term effects of a single exposure to GLY/GBH on a single species, whilst in reality multiple applications of GBHs together with other pesticides are common during a cropping cycle. Moreover, the interactions between GLY/GBHs and other aquatic contaminants are rarely studied. Higher toxicity of GBHs compared to GLY alone has often been observed, demonstrating that co-formulants can be highly toxic on their own and markedly increase the toxicity of the GBH formulation. The possible impurities in GBHs, such as heavy metals, can cause additional problems for the environment and food safety. The widespread and massive use of GBHs leads to increased exposure and environmental hazards. In addition, the need for a revision of the risk assessment system is emphasized. According to the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies, the current use and pollution of the aquatic environment by GLY/GBHs is highly problematic and cannot be considered environmentally sustainable. It is, therefore, necessary to at least tighten the permitted forms of use. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,143

Losses from spray drift mean that these potentially toxic ingredients can contaminate the environment and pose significant risks to human health. There is therefore a need for natural ingredients to formulate agrichemical sprays that are non-toxic to humans and less harmful to the environment to ensure greater safety and sustainability. Essential oils are promising candidates as natural biopesticides, but their application is limited due to their phytotoxicity at biocidal-effective dosages. A novel alternative approach utilizes essential oils as dilute oil-in-water emulsion spray adjuvants. This strategy can potentially reduce the usage of conventional pesticide ingredients by synergistically enhancing their effectiveness and reducing losses from spray drift. In this study, we evaluated the anti-drift potential of using plant-derived essential oils and quillaja saponin (a natural surfactant) to prepare dilute oil-in-water emulsions for use as safe and sustainable agrichemical adjuvants. In this study, we evaluated the potential of plant-derived essential oils and quillaja saponin, a natural surfactant, to create dilute oil-in-water emulsions as safe and sustainable agrichemical adjuvants. We found that emulsions made with methylated seed oil (MSO) and quillaja saponin showed similar drift reduction performance to those made with MSO and Tween 80, a synthetic non-ionic surfactant. Carvacrol (oregano and thyme essential oil) in water emulsion was found to increase the spray droplet size, thereby making it a promising ingredient for drift reduction. However, we found that limonene (citrus fruits essential oil) in water emulsion had no drift reduction abilities at the same specifications. The different performances of the two essential oils likely arise from differences in their physicochemical properties, which influence the spray atomization mechanism, specifically the ability of the oil droplets entering and spreading on the water–air interface to form perforations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,144

Spatial chemical monitoring of the active mobility of an agrochemical is essential to this agrochemical development process and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is proposed as a safer, easier alternative to the existing standard of autoradiography for the same. With desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI) using leaf imprints, we were able to visualize the active agrochemical mobility of a commercial fungicide formulation with the active ingredient Azoxystrobin in whole tomato leaves. The leaf-imprinting method was optimized with precise control over the pressure conditions and time of imprinting to yield highly consistent samples for imaging. The reproducibility of this method was tested with the Azoxystrobin formulation applied to tomato leaves and was compared to the mobility of the unformulated Azoxystrobin standard in similar application conditions. The xylem mobility and the lateral-leaf lamina spreading of the fungicide were visualized with mass spectrometry imaging and validated using complementary LC-MS studies. The necessity and importance of the agrochemical application as a formulation were re-iterated by the limited mobility observed in Azoxystrobin standard studies compared to the Azoxystrobin formulation.

One possible substitute among the compounds already in use in Brazil is the larvicide Diflubenzuron (DFB). The equation that defines the proportion of oviposition sites (habitats) contaminated by the auto-dissemination strategy was modified to account for the number of visits required to reach the necessary concentration of DFB for contamination, considering scenarios with varying numbers of oviposition sites and mosquito densities. The dissemination was evaluated in oviposition sites of 2 L, 1.5 L, 1 L, 0.5 L, 0.2 L, and 0.1 L. The minimum concentration of active ingredient (a.i) of DFB required for a commercial product to contaminate at least 50% of oviposition sites was also investigated, along with the impact of other vector control methods, such as the removal/destruction of oviposition sites and the use of insecticides to kill adult ‘females, on the auto-dissemination approach. The use of pure DFB compounds enabled contamination efficiency of more than 50% in oviposition sites with a volume of less than 2 L in scenarios with fewer oviposition sites. On the other hand, with the use of the commonly used concentration of the product, similar efficacy was only achieved in oviposition sites of 0.1 L and 0.2 L in medium and high infestation scenarios. Strategies that reduce the number of available oviposition sites work synergistically with the auto-dissemination strategy, making it possible to use less concentrated products and contaminated sites of larger volume. The strategy proved to be resilient in situations of insecticide application according to the concentration of DFB used, abundance of females, and low number of oviposition sites. Increasing the number of dissemination traps on the field also contributes to better results, especially for oviposition sites of 0.5 L and 1 L. The results of the model obtained under the stipulated conditions provide further support for the potential use of DFB as a substitute for PPF in the auto-dissemination strategy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,146

Suspension Concentrate formulations are one of the safest and most commonly utilized type in agrochemical industry. In this study, a suspension concentrate was developed and compared using a novel melt suspension technique alongside the conventional milling process. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of the new technique in terms of particle size reduction, processing time, and storage stability. In the melt suspension process, the low melting active ingredient(fungicide), was melted along with suitable surfactants and antifreeze in water and homogenized at high rotation per minute (2000). The same fungicide suspension concentrate was also prepared using milling process for comparison. Stability studies were conducted following the Food and Agricultural Organization procedure for both suspensions concentrate products. The storage stability results showed that particle size variation was just 0.8 ± 0.84% (w/v), antifungal content variation during storage stability studies was (±3.12 g/L) only, all other physical parameters results variations were < ± 0.5% w/v. Prepared suspension concentrates were further analyzed using three analytical techniques, Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The study suggests that the melt suspension technique can be an alternative to the normal milling process for preparing stable suspension concentrate, particularly for low melting point compounds. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,147

Modern insect-repellent technologies have greatly benefited from the development of plant essential oils, in particular. As a result, it appears that plant chemicals may one day be used in place of or in addition to chemical insecticides to protect agricultural products. These compounds do not harm the environment and are safer than chemical insecticides. One of the most important plant compounds that is currently getting much attention is plant essential oils. To decrease reapplications, toxicity, and cost, research efforts have concentrated on formulations with lower concentrations of active substances and sustained-release technologies. Currently, there is a remarkable interest in the development of eco-friendly, secure, and effective pesticides using intelligent, responsive, biodegradable, and biocompatible materials.

To this end, natural plant essential oils and their active ingredients are commonly employed as eco-friendly preservatives. However, in many cases, these substances require different formulations or materials to enhance their physicochemical properties. A promising approach to address this issue is the utilization of cocrystallization technology, which is emerging as a valuable tool for developing innovative agrochemicals. By forming self-assembled cocrystals comprising essential oil components, various benefits can be achieved, such as enhanced thermal stability, controlled release of volatiles, improved persistence during food storage, and ultimately, the extension of food shelf life. Scope and approach: This mini-review discusses the recent progress in food preservation research using essential oil cocrystals in terms of the design and synthesis, structural characterization, physicochemical properties, and application effects of essential oil cocrystals. Based on the reports of cocrystallization of essential oil components, it highlights the advantages, shortcomings, and future exploration trends of this technology according to the current research status and practical needs in the field. Key findings and conclusion: The cocrystallization of essential oil components presents novel opportunities for applied research involving these active ingredients. By creating cocrystals with controlled-release properties, a promising avenue emerges for utilizing them as an innovative resource in the food industry. This approach has the potential to contribute to the creation of novel food preservatives and innovative active packaging.

This study investigates potential mechanisms of action, analyzing uterine preparation towards the receptive state. Pregnant Wistar rats (F0) were treated orally with GBH or Gly (3.8 and 3.9 mg Gly/kg/day, respectively) from gestational day (GD) 9 until weaning. Adult F1 females became pregnant and uterine samples were collected on GD5 (preimplantation period). Histomorphological uterine parameters were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was applied to evaluate cell proliferation and protein expression of estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), cell cycle regulators (PTEN, cyclin G1, p27, and IGF1R-α), and the Wnt5a/β-catenin/FOXA2/Lif pathway. Both GBH and Gly females showed increased stromal proliferation, associated with a high expression of ERs. Dysregulation of PTEN and cyclin G1 was also observed in the Gly group. Reduced gland number was observed in both groups, along with decreased expression of Wnt5a/β-catenin/FOXA2/Lif pathway in the glandular epithelium. Overall, GBH and Gly perinatal exposure disrupted intrinsic uterine pathways involved in endometrial proliferation and glandular function, providing a plausible mechanism for glyphosate-induced implantation failure by compromising uterine receptivity. Similar effects between GBH and Gly suggest the active principle mainly drives the adverse outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,151

This review documents a comparative database of plant-based green pesticidal products developed and registered in different countries. Although Pakistan is far behind in this regard, a substantial number of green pesticides have been developed in other countries. Here we present a comprehensive list of these botanical pesticides developed and registered against different insect pests in Canada, China, and Greece. Analysis of these botanical pesticidal products has shown about 16 plant species used as active ingredients of green pesticides for controlling various insect pests in agriculture, household, personal, urban and veterinary sectors. Products based on lemon-scented gum tree Corymbia citriodora (66%), garlic Allium sativum (6%), pyrethrum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium (6%) and camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (5%) are the most common among total 161 products being manufactured and marketed by 76 companies in above mentioned three countries. All the listed products are currently registered by their respective national ministries. Insect pests belonging to 23 families of orders Diptera, Phthiraptera, Lepidoptera, and Siphonaptera are the major targets of these botanical pesticidal products. Similarly, two technical grade active ingredients and 16 formulation types were identified among these products. The most common formulation types are the any other liquid (AL) (36.02%) and vaporizing products (VP) (11.18%). In Pakistan, there should be more focus on the green pesticidal research and development and the Government should support such initiatives by taking all the stockholders onboard in order to promote organic plant protection strategies as biorational alternatives of hazardous synthetic pesticides. © 2025 by the authors.

About 60% of all biological fungicides have Trichoderma species as the active ingredient, with T. harzianum as the most common species in these products. However, the name T. harzianum has often been used incorrectly in culture collections, databases, and scientific literature due to the division of the Harzianum clade (HC) into more than 95 cryptic species, with only one being named T. harzianum. In this study, 49 strains previously identified as T. harzianum in three surveys of Trichoderma species from soils in South and Central America were re-identified using phylogenetic analyses based on tef1α, rpb2, and ITS sequences obtained from GenBank. These were combined with the HC species from two other studies, which were identified based on the current taxonomy. Based on the results of the five surveys of the total 148 strains in HC, 11 species were identified. T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, and T. endophyticum, followed by T. azevedoi and T. harzianum, were the dominant species of the HC in South and Central America. This is the first report to identify dominant Trichoderma species within the HC in South and Central American soil based on multiple studies.

This presents a concern for the efficacy of clothianidin, an agricultural neonicotinoid prequalified for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS). Methods: Using standard bioassays, we tested if reduced susceptibility to clothianidin can affect the efficacy of SumiShield® 50WG, one of four new IRS formulations containing clothianidin. We simultaneously monitored susceptibility to clothianidin and to SumiShield 50WG, testing adults of Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii and Culex sp sampled from urban, suburban and agricultural areas of Yaoundé, Cameroon. Results: We found that in this geographic area, the level of susceptibility to the active ingredient predicted the efficacy of SumiShield 50WG. This formulation was very potent against populations that reached 100% mortality within 72 h of exposure to a discriminating concentration of clothianidin. By contrast, mortality leveled off at 75.4 ± 3.5% within 7 days of exposure to SumiShield 50WG in An. gambiae adults collected from a farm where the spraying of the two neonicotinoids acetamiprid and imidacloprid for crop protection is likely driving resistance to clothianidin. Conclusions: Despite the relatively small geographic extend of the study, the findings suggest that cross-resistance may impact the efficacy of some new IRS formulations and that alternative compounds could be prioritized in areas where neonicotinoid resistance is emerging. © 2024, The Author(s).",NA,154

Here, we investigated under in vitro conditions, the impact of defoliation practices, i.e., mechanical defoliation or chemical defoliation with a contact herbicide (Reglone®, containing the active ingredient diquat) or systemic herbicide (RoundUp®, containing the active ingredient glyphosate), on the dynamics of spore production of Rhizophagus irregularis and Rhizophagus intraradices associated with Solanum tuberosum and/or Medicago truncatula. Glyphosate affected the spore production rate more rapidly and severely than diquat or mechanical defoliation. We hypothesize that this effect was related to disruption of the C metabolism in the whole plant combined with a possible direct effect of glyphosate on the fungus within the roots and/or perhaps in soil via the release of this active ingredient from decaying roots. No glyphosate could be detected in the roots due to technical constraints, while its release from the roots in the medium corresponded to 0.11% of the active ingredient applied to the leaves. The three defoliation practices strongly affected root colonization, compared to the non-defoliated plants. However, the amount of glyphosate released into the medium did not affect spore germination and germ tube growth. These results suggest that the effects of defoliation on the dynamics of spore production are mainly indirect via an impact on the plant, and that the effect is faster and more marked with the glyphosate-formulation, possibly via a direct effect on the fungus in the roots and more unlikely on spore germination. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",NA,155

In this study, effects of typical adjuvants (i.e. hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) and p-Octyl polyethylene glycol phenyl ether (TX-100)) on the photodegradation of four selected neonicotinoid insecticides (NIs), including thiamethoxam (TMX), dinotefuran (DIN), imidacloprid (IMP) and acetamiprid (ACP) were systematically investigated. Specifically, CTAB and CTAC exhibited minimal or no impact on the photolysis of four NIs, while TX-100 significantly inhibited their decay. Such inhibitory effect could mainly be attributed weakening the formation of key transient intermediates, such as the corresponding radical cation (NI•+), radical anion (NI•-) as well as hydrated electron (eaq-). Photoproducts identification revealed a novel transformation pathway of NIs in the presence of TX-100, characterized by de-chain reactions, resulting in the formation of photostable dimeric photoproducts. These dimers exhibited varying toxicity: for TMX, DIN and IMP, their corresponding dimers showed increased toxicity compared to their parent compounds, whereas for ACP, they displayed decreased toxicity. These provide important information for the evaluation the environmental fates and toxicology of formulaic NIs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,156

Most commercial compound formulations are open systems with non-adjustable released rates, resulting in a high frequency of applications. Meanwhile, although nano pesticide delivery systems constructed with different carrier materials have been extensively studied, realizing their actual scale-up production still has important practical significance due to the large-scale field application. In this study, a boscalid and pyraclostrobin dual-loaded nano pesticide system (BPDN) was constructed with industrial-grade carrier materials to facilitate the realization of large-scale production. The optimal industrial-scale preparation mechanism of BPDN was studied with surfactants as key factors. When agricultural emulsifier No.600 and polycarboxylate are used as the ratio of 1:2 in the preparation process, the BPDN has a spherical structure with an average size of 270 nm and exhibits superior physical stability. Compared with commercial formulation, BPDN maintains rate-stabilized release up to 5 times longer, exhibits better dispersion and spreading performance on foliar, has more than 20% higher deposition amounts, and reduces loss. A single application of BPDN could efficiently control tomato gray mold during the growing period of tomatoes due to extended duration and combinatory effectiveness, reducing two application times and labor costs. Toxicology tests on various objects systematically demonstrated that BPDN has improved safety for HepG2 cells, and nontarget organism earthworms. This research provides insight into creating safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly pesticide production to reduce manual operation times and labor costs.

Data collection included strategically selected farm and field data, pesticide records and farming practices. Results involved more than 1700 recorded PPP applications across various crops with more than 170 different active substances from PPP in organic, integrated pest management and conventional farming practices. We explored differences in application patterns (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides and non-PPP, e.g. adjuvants, growth regulators, and fertilizers) between and within crops, countries and farming systems and calculated the costs of PPP use. The pesticide dosages applied during the crop season varied up to a factor of 20 around recommended doses. Regarding the costs of PPPs use perennial crops had the highest costs per ha crop production area. Finally, we analysed the active substances applied in different farming systems in terms of their hazard statements. Our results shed light on how PPPs are used across different crop and farming types and will help elucidate how pesticide application patterns can be changed in the future.

Therefore, finding antibiotic alternatives is considered of vital importance. Investigation of the antimicrobial properties of several plant substances and extracts is of great value to replace antibiotics. With this objective, this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of an ethanolic extract prepared from olive mill wastewater (OMWW), which is a by-product of olive oil production with considerable environmental burden, against 38 bacterial strains, including fish-associated pathogens, non-pathogenic isolates, collection strains, and one yeast strain, Candida albicans. Disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) tests were used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the OMWWE. According to the results, OMWWE provoked strong inhibitory effects against Shewanella baltica strain SY-S145. It also showed a moderate inhibitory effect on Plesiomonas shigelloides strain SY-PS16 and Vibrio anguillarum strain SY-L24. The MIC and MBC of OMWWE on Shewanella baltica SY-S145, Vibrio gigantis strain C24, and V. anguillarum strain SY-L24 were 500 µg/mL.

The interaction and functional properties of them, and their potential as fungicidal agents for agricultural products and as organic preservatives for cosmetics were assessed in this paper. The SF addition makes the RLs aggregation easier through the complexes formation, which decreases the applied concentration of surfactant. The results of spectroscopic analyses and molecular docking suggest that hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces are significant contributed to the binding mechanism between the two substances. The addition of SF notably enhances the foaming capacity and stability of RLs. The certain antibacterial and antifungal properties of RLs are basically not affected by the SF addition, even the SF-RLS system demonstrates an unobvious synergistic inhibitory impact on Glomerella cingulate (GC).

However, the application of these chemicals detrimentally affected the non-target organisms including soil biota. Fipronil (FIP), a broad-spectrum insecticide, is extensively used to control pests across the globe. The frequent usage calls for attention regarding risk assessment of undesirable effects on non-target microorganisms. Here, laboratory-based experiments were conducted to assess the effect of FIP on plant-beneficial bacteria (PBB); Rhizobium leguminosarum (Acc. No. PQ578652), Azotobacter salinestris (Acc. No. PQ578649) and Serratia marcescens (Acc. No. PQ578651). PBB synthesized growth regulating substances were negatively affected by increasing fipronil concentrations. For instance, at 100 µg FIPmL−1, a decrease in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis by bacterial strains followed the order: A. salinestris (95.6%) S. marcescens (91.6%) > R. leguminosarum (87%). Also, exposure of bacteria cells to FIP hindered the growth and morphology of PBB observed as distortion, cracking, and aberrant structure under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, FIP-treated and propidium iodide (PI)-stained bacterial cells displayed an insecticide dose-dependent increase in cellular permeability as observed under a confocal laser microscope (CLSM). Colony counts (log10 CFU mL−1) and growth of A. salinestris was completely inhibited at 150 µg FIPmL−1. The surface adhering ability (biofilm formation) of PBB was also disrupted/inhibited in a FIP dose-related manner. The respiration loss due to FIP was coupled with a reduction in population size. Fipronil at 150 µgmL−1 decreased cellular respiration in A. salinestris (72%) S. marcescens (53%) and R. leguminosarum (85%). Additionally, biomarker enzymes; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and oxidative stress (catalase; CAT) induced by FIP represented significant (p ≤ 0.05) toxicity towards PBB strains. Conclusively, fipronil suggests a toxic effect that emphasizes their careful monitoring in soils before application and their optimum addition in the soil–plant system.

Therefore, we studied transcriptomic changes in barley leaves induced in response to spraying leaf surfaces with two alcohol ethoxylates (AEs). As model surfactants, we selected the monodisperse tetraethylene glycol monododecyl (C12E4) ether and the polydisperse BrijL4. Barley plants were harvested 8 h after spraying with a 0.1% surfactant solution and changes in gene expression were analysed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq). Gene expression was significantly altered in response to both surfactants. With BrijL4 more genes (9724) were differentially expressed compared to C12E4 (6197). Gene families showing pronounced up-regulation were cytochrome P450 enzymes, monooxygenases, ABC-transporters, acetyl- and methyl- transferases, glutathione-S-transferases and glycosyltransferases. These specific changes in gene expression and the postulated function of the corresponding enzymes allowed hypothesizing three potential metabolic pathways of AE detoxification in barley leaves. (i) Up-regulation of P450 cytochrome oxidoreductases suggested a degradation of the lipophilic alkyl residue (dodecyl chain) of the AEs by ω- and β- oxidation. (ii) Alternatively, the polar PEG-chain of AEs could be degraded. (iii) Instead of surfactant degradation, a further pathway of detoxification could be the sequestration of AEs into the vacuole or the apoplast (cell wall). Thus, our results show that AEs lead to pronounced changes in the expression of genes coding for proteins potentially being involved in the detoxification of surfactants. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,163

The surface of the modified CPE was constructed by electrodepositing the copper layer at the accumulation step in 1-mM CuSO4.5H2O, PBS at pH 6.6, E accumulation: − 0.8 V, and Taccumulation 240 s. The determining step was performed by adding different concentrations of malathion pesticide and applying the potential toward more positive potential at (− 0.8–+ 1.4 V) to enhance the oxidation of Cu0 metal. It was noticed that the malathion concentration gradient enhances the oxidation peak current of copper at + 0.03 V gradually. SW-ASV method validation was performed at a linearity range confined in (1–10 µM). An analytical curve was constructed and R2 was equal to 0.99995 with good fitted linear relationship. LOD and LOQ were calculated to be 0.0247 and 0.08236 µM, respectively. ANOVA for two sets of measurements using the standard gas chromatographic method and the suggested SW-ASV method was demonstrated via the calculations of F-value and t-value. F and t-values were calculated to be 1.698 and 0.289, respectively, which did not exceed the tabulated F and t-values resulting in the great similarity of results and ensuring the reliability of the suggested test method. This valid SW-ASV method was used to perform the routine analysis of the 95% technical grade and the pesticide formulation 57% emulsion concentrate of the malathion. Valid results were achieved with satisfactory limits of accuracy and precision. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,164

Laccases are a class of poly-copper oxidoreductases that retain significant biotechnological relevance owing to their notable oxidative capabilities and their application in the elimination of synthetic dyes, phenolic compounds, insecticides, and various other substances. This study investigates the impact of surface active ionic liquids (SAILs), namely, decyltrimethylammonium bromide [N10111][Br] and 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C10mim][Cl] as cationic surfactant ionic liquids and cholinium decanoate [Chl][Dec], an anionic surfactant ionic liquid, on the structure and function of laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor (TvL) by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method. In summary, this study showed that laccase solvent-accessible surface area increased in the ionic liquid [Chl][Dec] while it decreased in the other two ionic liquids. Interestingly, [Chl][Dec] ionic liquid components formed hydrogen bonds with laccase, while [N10111][Br] and [C10mim][Cl] components were unable to form hydrogen bonds with laccase. The quantity of hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and the enzyme was also diminished in the presence of [Chl][Dec] in comparison to the other two ionic liquids. especially at a concentration of 250 mM. In 250 mM concentrations of [N10111][Br] and [C10mim][Cl], clusters of long-chain cations are likely to form near the copper T1 site. However, even at low [Chl][Dec] concentrations, long [Dec]- chains were observed to penetrate the enzyme near the copper T1 site, and at 250 mM [Chl][Dec], a large cluster of anions occupied the opening of the active site. The results of the analysis also show that the interaction between the [Dec]- anion and the enzyme is stronger than the interaction between [N10111]+ and [C10mim]+ with laccase; in addition, the [Dec]- anion, compared to [Br]- and [Cl]- has a much greater tendency to bind with the enzyme residues. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,165

However, biological assays using model organisms to evaluate their cytogenotoxic and mutagenic potential are still scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the commercial product Cultar® 250 SC (CP) and the pure substance (PBZ) on the germination and initial seedling development of Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce), in addition to evaluating the effects of CP on the mitotic activity and DNA, as we believe that PBZ has a greater toxic potential than CP on seed germination, and that the latter has cytogenotoxic and mutagenic effects on L. sativa. Lettuce seeds treated with CP and with PBZ in the doses of 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, and 2 g L−1 showed significant reductions in germination rate, as well the CP reduced the root and initial development seedling development. PBZ showed greater inhibition of germination compared to CP. In direct exposure to PBZ, there was not sufficient seedling development for analysis, while in discontinuous treatment, there was inhibition of root growth (except for doses of 0.25 and 0.50 g L−1) and in the development of the aerial part. While no mitodepressive effect was observed in meristematic cells treated with CP, increased frequencies of chromosomal alterations, including condensed nuclei and micronuclei, were evident in both meristematic cells and the F1 region. The Comet assay further demonstrated higher levels of DNA damage at higher paclobutrazol doses, supporting the findings of increased micronucleus frequencies. Consequently, it can be concluded that the CP exhibits greater toxicity towards seed germination compared to lettuce seedlings, and PBZ has a greater toxic potential than CP in relation to these parameters. However, the impact of CP on seedlings was relatively minimal, as evidenced by their limited effects on development, cell proliferation, and DNA, suggesting a slight toxicity of this agent. Therefore, we infer that Cultar® 250 SC should be used with caution. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of employing joint analyses to better elucidate and correlate the mechanisms of action of potentially toxic substances. Furthermore, it provides a basis for discussing the application of Cultar® 250 SC and seeking more sustainable alternatives in food production.

Control methods primarily rely on chemical pesticides, which pose environmental risks and potential hazards to human health. There is a need for sustainable management alternatives such as biologically-based slug control options. However, the efficacy of nonchemical measures for controlling pest slug populations remains limited, particularly in the context of variable outdoor conditions. Neuropeptides and their corresponding receptors have been proposed as promising biological targets for the development of new pest management strategies. RESULTS: A total of 23 bioactive peptides belonging to the PRX family, previously identified from the grey garden slug, D. reticulatum, were injected into or fed to this species. The detrimental effects of these peptides, including a reduction in body weight and an inhibition of feeding activity, were evaluated in feeding choice tests with D. reticulatum. Furthermore, the bioactive peptide formulated with a lipid particle demonstrated a feeding deterrent effect. One of the myomodulin (MM) peptides, APPLPRY, demonstrated a significant reduction in feeding activity, resulting in a reduction in slug weight or mortality in just 30 min. CONCLUSION: The results represent the first evidence of a bioactive peptide having detrimental effects on D. reticulatum including causing feeding deterrent for this slug pest. The in vivo results provide insights into the potential development of active ingredients for managing slugs in the field. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,167

The present research aims to obtain by gas chromatography, the chemical profile of Prunus armeniaca L. kernel volatile fractions. The evaluation of the in vitro antifungal activities of the sterilized powder and volatile fractions of the plant P. armeniaca L. kernels was performed. Diffusion in a solid medium and broth microdilution methods were applied on fungi with medical importance (dermatophytes, yeasts and Aspergillus spp.). P. armeniaca L. powder based antidermatphyte cream has been formulated. Hydro-distillation generated two volatile fractions (VF1 and VF2) and chromatographic analysis showed the presence of three compounds for VF1 (98.7 % benzaldehyde, 1.0 % benzyl alcohol and 0.3 % 1,8-cineole) and two compounds for VF2 (90.3 % benzaldehyde and 9.3 % benzyl alcohol). The 2.5 % to 5 % concentrations in powder showed antifungal activities against dermatophytic strains. 1.25 to 2 mg/mL concentrations in volatile fractions were efficient against yeast strains, with a better efficiency for the VF1. The creams formulated were stable, cosmetically attractive with satisfactory pH, viscosity and spread ability.

The advancement in insecticidal paint technology has steered toward the development and evaluation of such formulations for use against arthropod vectors. The improved insecticidal paint formulations may contain two or more active agents, hence could display different type of activity against the target vectors. In the present study, optimum concentrations of deltamethrin (1%), chlorpyriphos (0.5%) and pyriproxyfen (0.075%) were used as active ingredients (AIs) to develop flame retardant slow-release insecticides paint (FRSRIP) formulation. The developed formulation was tested for physico-chemical properties, toxicity and efficacy against two important mosquito vectors. The formulation was glossy, smooth, uniform and scratch proof. Furthermore, the formulation was flame retardant and conformed to class-A according to the guidelines. Acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity suggested that the formulation is safe for use in human dwellings. The formulation was evaluated against Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi mosquitoes in laboratory upto four years. It was found that KDT50 after 24 months (T24) was 14.8 ± 0.8 min and 17.1 ± 1.0 min, while after 48 month (T48) was 21.3 ± 2.0 min and 22.4 ± 1.4 min in both Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi respectively. KDT50 was found varying during the different time intervals (T6 to T48) in both Ae. aegypti (p = 0.01) and An. stephensi (p = 0.0003). Furthermore the corrected mortality (CM) also found statistically declined during the period of evaluation (T6 to T48) in both the test species (F ≥ 42. 4; p ≤ 0.0001). Ae. aegypti mosquitoes that survived FRSRIP exposure exhibited overall decline in total eggs laid, eggs hatched, pupae formed and adult emerged at different time intervals upto T21. Behavioural experiments showed that both the tested species elicited negative response to the test formulation. The concentrations of all the three active agents were estimated by HPLC after different time intervals, however only deltamethrin (0.24%) was found after T48. The developed formulation was stable, safe and effective against mosquito vectors for a considerably longer time. In the pretext of continuous toll of vector borne diseases and trans-boundary expansion of mosquito vectors into new geographical areas, the idea of using insecticidal paint could be a game changer. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,170

While non-ionic surfactants are generally low-toxic, stable, and excellent dispersants with high solubilization capabilities, they may be less effective than cationic surfactants, which offer superior surface activity, transport properties, and antimicrobial action. This study investigates the efficacy of new piperidinium surfactants with carbamate fragments as adjuvants in insecticide formulations containing imidacloprid. The efficacy of these formulations is being assessed against greenhouse whitefly, a pest known to harm cultivated and ornamental flowering plants. RESULTS: The aggregation behavior of piperidinium surfactants containing carbamate fragments was investigated, and their wetting effect was evaluated. Synthesized surfactants have lower CMC values compared to their methylpiperidinium analogue. The effect of piperidinium surfactants on the insecticide concentration on the surface and inside tomato leaves was assessed using spectrophotometric methods. It was found that the introduction of piperidinium surfactants with carbamate fragment at a concentration of 0.1% wt. allows for decrease in lethal concentration of imidacloprid up to 10 times, thereby testifying the marked increase in the effectiveness of imidacloprid against the greenhouse whitefly insect pest (Trialeurodes vaporariorum). It was shown that the main factors responsible for the enhanced efficacy of the insecticide were the ability of the surfactant to increase the concentration of imidacloprid on the leaf surfaces and improve their penetration into the plant. CONCLUSION: The presented work employed a comprehensive approach, which significantly increases the generalizability of the results obtained and provides the ability to predict the effect and target selection of adjuvants. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,171

Environmental concerns surrounding such fungicides necessitate sustainable alternatives like grape cane extracts. However, studies into their efficacy and effects on the product remain limited. This study aimed to assess the open-field efficacy of a novel grape cane extract formulation, alone and combined with a copper agent, against downy mildew, and to examine its impact on berry and must composition. The results were compared to standard fungicides frequently used in integrated and organic viticulture. In 2022, the grape cane extract formulation reduced downy mildew severity by 78 % on berry clusters, comparable to the maximum acceptable dose of copper for organic farming in Germany (3 kg/ha/a). Combining the grape cane extract with the copper agent was more effective than the copper agent alone, but not more effective than the grape cane extract alone. In 2023, disease development was marginal, despite artificial inoculation. Compositional differences detectable by FTIR were insignificant between musts derived from all treatments, increased copper levels were observed whenever copper had been applied. The phenolic content in freeze-dried, de-seeded berries of 2022 was significantly lower after copper (14.6 mg/g dry weight DW) and grape cane extract treatments (6.6 mg/g DW) when compared to the control (36.1 mg/g DW), with discrepancies in stilbenoid and flavan-3-ol levels in particular, as analysed by HPLC-DAD. However, these differences were not confirmed in 2023, with results showing no correlations between different treatments and phenolic contents. These findings suggest that applications of the phenolic grape cane extract do not lead to artificially altered levels or relevant residues of the active constituents; i.e., the phenolic compounds in the product. In brief, grape cane extracts might represent a promising natural alternative to controlling grapevine downy mildew, particularly in organic viticulture, which, to date, heavily relies on (eco-)toxic copper-pesticides. Further multi-year studies including wine analyses are warranted to follow the entire flow towards the final product. © 2024, International Viticulture and Enology Society.

To maximise the effectiveness of CRFs however, it is crucial to understand the herbicide-releasing behaviour at play, which predominately depends on the interaction mechanisms between active ingredients and carrier materials during adsorption. In this study, we investigated and modelled the adsorption characteristics of model herbicide 2,4-D onto two organo-montmorillonites (octadecylamine- and aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified) to synthesise polymer-based CRFs. Herbicide-releasing behaviour of the synthesised CRF microbeads was then analysed under various experimental conditions, and weed control efficacy determined under glasshouse conditions. Results revealed that adsorption of 2,4-D onto both organo-montmorillonites follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and is predominately controlled by the chemisorption process. However, multi-step mechanisms were detected in the adsorption on both organoclays, hence intra-particle diffusion is not the sole rate-limiting step for the adsorption process. Both organoclays followed the Elovich model, suggesting they have energetically heterogeneous surfaces. Herbicide-releasing behaviours of synthesised beads were investigated at various pH temperatures and ionic strengths under laboratory and glasshouse conditions. Furthermore, weed control efficacy of synthesised beads were investigated using pot studies under glasshouse condition. Desorption studies revealed that both synthesised microbeads have slow releasing behaviour at a wide range of pHs (5–9), temperatures (25–45 °C), and ionic strengths. The results also revealed that synthesised microbeads have excellent weed control efficacy on different broad-leaf weed species under glasshouse conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,173

Evaluation of dry neonicotinoid residues on treated filter paper is a commonly used method to determine the toxicity of active ingredients towards target and non-target organisms. Dry residues of four neonicotinoids, acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, on filter paper did not cause significant levels of mortality in Hippodamia convergens (Guérin-Méneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) when compared to paired untreated groups. Conversely, nearly 100% mortality was observed when test insects were exposed to dry neonicotinoid residues on leaf discs and glass plate surfaces. On the other hand, dry residues of the pyrethroid bifenthrin on filter paper, leaf disks, and glass plates killed significantly more test insects when compared to untreated groups. Additional bioassays tested the toxicity of acetamiprid and thiamethoxam by evaluating the toxicity of dry residues on (1) the upper and (2) lower surfaces of treated filter paper, (3) on a glass plate underneath treated filter paper, (4) on the upper surface of treated filter paper treated with insecticide and adjuvant, and (5) dried residues on a glass plate after dipping treated filter paper in water and letting the solvent dry on the inert test surface. The results indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides applied to filter paper were adsorbed. Toxic compounds possibly move in between and binding to paper fibers so that no toxic residues were left on treated surfaces. However, adsorbed insecticides were still biologically active when washed out of filter paper and dried on an inert glass surface.

Itraconazole, terbinafine,and amphotericin B are the most used antifungals for treating sporotrichosis. However, many strains of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii have shown resistance to these agents, highlighting the importance of findingnew therapeutic options.

Two forms of phase-different nanodelivery systems of layered double hydroxide LDH and oil/water nanoemulsions were formulated. The synthesized nanoemulsions showed particle sizes of 199 and 333 nm for AJ-NE and PP-NE, with a polydispersity index of 0.249 and 0.198, respectively. Chemical and physiochemical analysis of TEM, SEM, XRD, zeta potential, drug loading capacity, and drug release measurements were done to confirm the synthesis and loading efficiencies of essential oils' active ingredients.

The mortality rate reached 100% for 2nd and 4th instar larvae. The relative toxicities revealed that PP nanoemulsion (MA-NE) was the most effective larvicide, followed by AJ nanoemulsion (AJ-NE). There was a significant increase in defensive enzymes, phenoloxidase, and α and β-esterase enzymes in the treated groups.

To address the critical scientific problem of how BAC affects the efficiency of EGSB reactors, this research uniquely evaluated the long-term stress response to BAC by systematically comparing continuous and discontinuous inhibitor exposure scenarios. The novel comparison demonstrated that inhibitor concentration is of minor relevance compared to the biomass-specific cumulative inhibitor load in the reactor. After exceeding a critical biomass-specific cumulative inhibitor load of 6.1–6.5 mg BAC/g VS, continuous and discontinuous exposure to BAC caused comparable significant deterioration in reactor performance, including accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), decreased removal efficiency, reduced methane production, as well as the wash-out, flotation, and disintegration of anaerobic granules. BAC exposures had a more detrimental effect on methanogenesis than on acidogenesis. Moreover, long-term stress by BAC led to an inhibition of protein production, resulting in a decreased protein-to-polysaccharide ratio of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that promoted destabilizing effects on the granules. Finally, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was triggered. Reactor performance could not be restored due to the severe loss of granular sludge. © 2024 The Authors",NA,178

Nanopesticide research, introduced relatively recently, is an emerging field that can be defined as application of nanotechnology for crop protection. Nanopesticides have been proven to be more effective in reducing pest populations and plant infestation levels than bulk chemical pesticides.Some of the advantages that nanopesticide formulations present are increased solubility of water-insoluble active ingredients, increased formulation stability, elimination of toxic organic solvents when compared to conventional pesticides, the ability to release active ingredients gradually, enhanced stability to prevent early degradation, increased mobility and higher pesticidal activity due to smaller particle size, and a larger surface area that may lengthen their shelf life. Furthermore, the nanopesticides we're interested in are synthesized using plant-based substances, making them promising alternatives to traditional pest control chemicals. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) play an important role in human nutrition due to their high nutritional value. However, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, harmful insect species and mites can limit and reduce their production. In the current paper, we present the framework on which plant based nanopesticide technology is based, as well as the various techniques for determining nanoparticle properties. We highlight the potential for several medicinal and aromatic plants from the Khenifra region in Morocco to be used in the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles. We also reviewed the use of metal nanoparticles in crop protection, emphasizing the control of green bean’s pests and disease, while compiling numerous research that demonstrate their effectiveness. After comparing plant-based nanopesticides to chemical pesticides used to treat green beans in Morocco, it is clear that they have enormous potential for treating pests and diseases with fewer negative effects on the environment and human health. © Articles by the authors;.",NA,179

Then, peat extract (Pe) and surfactants with different ratios were single- and multi-modified on CGS, respectively, to prepare Pe-modified CGS (Pe-CGS) and multi-modified CGS, respectively. The microscopic morphology of multi-modified CGS was studied using various testing methods. The de-risking effect on Cd(II) and hymexazol in wastewater was investigated, and the effects of temperature, pH, and ionic strength were compared. The spheroidal structure of S was destroyed after carbonization, and Pe and surfactants were modified on the surface and changed the surface properties of CGS. The adsorption processes of Cd(II) and hymexazol were suitable to be described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities (qm) of Cd(II) and adsorption capacity parameter (k) of hymexazol on different modified CGSs presented the peak value at BS/Pe-CGS. With the increase in the modification ratio of Pe, BS, and SDS, qm and k increased, which showed a high value at 100 % modification. Increases in temperature and pH were beneficial to Cd(II) adsorption but were not conducive to hymexazol adsorption. The adsorption amount decreased for Cd(II) and increased first and then reduced for hymexazol with the rise in ionic strength. The adsorption process exhibited spontaneity, endothermic behavior for Cd(II), exothermic behavior for hymexazol, and an entropy-increasing reaction. The adsorption amount of Cd(II) and hymexazol by multi-modified CGS maintained approximately 81 % of the original sample after three rounds of regeneration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,180

However, there are no efficient strategies available for screening low-toxicity surfactants, and traditional toxicity studies rely on extensive experimentation which are not predictive. Herein, a commonly used agricultural adjuvant Triton X (TX) series was selected to study the function of amphipathic structure to their toxicity in zebrafish. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transcriptomics, metabolomics and machine learning (ML) were used to study the toxic effects and predict the toxicity of various TX. The results showed that TX with a relatively short hydrophilic chain was highly toxic to zebrafish with LC50 of 1.526 mg/L. However, TX with a longer hydrophilic chain was more likely to damage the heart, liver and gonads of zebrafish through the arachidonic acid metabolic network, suggesting that the effect of surfactants on membrane permeability is the key to determine toxic results. Moreover, biomarkers were screened through machine learning, and other hydrophilic chain lengths were predicted to affect zebrafish heart health potentially. Our study provides an advanced adjuvants screening method to improve the bioavailability of pesticides while reducing environmental impacts. © 2024",NA,181

Reliance on synthetic pyrethroid insecticides and limited availability of diverse modes of action (MoAs) has increased insecticide resistance selection in regional T. picirostris populations, emphasizing the need to evaluate novel chemistries and rotational strategies for effective insecticide resistance management (IRM). The efficacy of 8 foliar insecticide formulations for managing T. picirostris adult and larval life stages was determined in small and large-plot field trials across 2 crop years. In both years, bifenthrin (Brigade 2EC), the grower's standard, showed negligible adult and larval suppression. Insecticide formulations with isocycloseram and cyantraniliprole active ingredients reduced adult and larval populations when applied at BBCH 59-60 (prebloom) and BBCH 65-66 (full bloom) growth stages, respectively. While differences in T. picirostris abundance were observed among insecticide treatments, seed yield differences were not detected in large-plot trials. Larval abundance was correlated with reduced seed yield, and an economic threshold of ≥3 larvae per 30 inflorescences was determined as a conservative larval threshold to justify foliar applications of diamide insecticides. Additional commercial white clover seed fields were surveyed to compare larval scouting techniques, including a standard Berlese funnel and a grower's do-it-yourself funnel. Both larval extraction techniques were correlated and provided similar estimates of larval abundance. These findings demonstrate new MoAs, optimal insecticide application timing, and larval monitoring methods that can be incorporated into an effective T. picirostris IRM program in white clover seed crops. © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,182

Therefore, the extracts of invasive silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav.) weeds using their berries parts (seeds, peels and mucilage) supported by bioassay-guided fractionation were tested against both the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) and Erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora causes of the blackleg of potatoes. The seeds and peels of S. elaeagnifolium were successively extracted by maceration using dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and ethanol (EtOH), respectively. While, its mucilage was extracted using EtOAc. The successive EtOH extract of the plant seeds had promising inhibition efficacy and the best minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 50 µg/ml against E. Carotovora amongst other extracts (DCM and EtOAc of the plant berries parts). Depending on dose response activity, EtOH extract had G. mellonella larval mortality and pupal duration rates (LC50; 198.30 and LC95; 1294.73 µg/ml), respectively. Additionally, this EtOH extract of seeds was fractionated using preparative TLC to three characteristic bands. The insecticidal and bacterial activities of these isolated bands (SEA, SEB, and SEC) were evaluated at a dose of 100 µg/ml, causing mortality by 48.48, 62.63 and 92.93% (G. mellonella larvae) and inhibition by 15.22, 0.00 and 31.66 mm (E. carotovora), respectively. Moreover, the separated major three bands were tentatively identified using LC-ESI-MS analysis revealing the presence of two phenolic acids; chlorogenic acid (SEA) and dicaffeoyl quinic acid (SEB) in addition to one steroidal saponin (SEC) annotated as borassoside E or yamoscin. Finally, the plant seeds’ successive EtOH extract as well as its active constituents, exhibited potential broad-spectrum activity and the ability to participate in future pest management initiatives.

Plant protection products are applied to achieve high crop yield, but residues of their active substances are frequently detected in bee matrices and could affect honey bee colonies. In addition, intensified agriculture could lead to resource limitation for honey bees. This study aimed to compare the response of full-sized and nucleus colonies to the combined stressors of fungicide exposure and resource limitation. A large-scale field study was conducted simultaneously at five different locations across Germany, starting in spring 2022 and continuing through spring 2023. The fungicide formulation Pictor® Active (active ingredients boscalid and pyraclostrobin) was applied according to label instructions at the maximum recommended rate on oil seed rape crops. Resource limitation was ensured by pollen restriction using a pollen trap and stressor responses were evaluated by assessing colony development, brood development, and core gut microbiome alterations. Furthermore, effects on the plant nectar microbiome were assessed since nectar inhabiting yeast are beneficial for pollination. We showed, that honey bee colonies were able to compensate for the combined stressor effects within six weeks. Nucleus colonies exposed to the combined stressors showed a short-term response with a less favorable brood to bee ratio and reduced colony development in May. No further impacts were observed in either the nucleus colonies or the full-sized colonies from July until the following spring. In addition, no fungicide-dependent differences were found in core gut and nectar microbiomes, and these differences were not distinguishable from local or environmental effects. Therefore, the provision of sufficient resources is important to increase the resilience of honey bees to a combination of stressors. © 2024 The Authors",NA,184

Studies on Gly and glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) exposure in different experimental models have suggested that the nervous system represented a key target for its toxicity, especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, it is still unknown whether exposure to GBH affects higher brain functions dependent on PFC circuitry. The present work aimed to examine the effects of subtoxic doses of GBH on social cognition and cognitive flexibility as two functions belonging to higher brain function in mice. To do so, adult male mice were exposed daily to GBH by gavage at doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg for a sub-chronic period lasting 6 weeks. Then, mice were subjected to behavioral testing using the three-chamber and the Barnes maze paradigms. Our results indicate that GBH did not affect sociability. However, we found that GBH affects social cognition expressed by a lower discrimination index in the three-chamber test. Moreover, spatial memories evaluated during the probe trial, and cognitive flexibility evaluated during the reversal probe, were affected in mice exposed to GBH. Based on these results, exposure to subtoxic doses of GBH led to neurobehavioral alterations affecting the integrity of social cognition and cognitive flexibility functions. Finally, these data urge a thorough investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations. © 2024 The Authors",NA,185

Spontaneous spreading involves a surface tension gradient (Marangoni stresses), which enhances spreading over a large area. Experimental observations reveal that the spreading rate and surfactant concentration have an optimum substrate wettability of 60 ± 5° ( Hill, R. M. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 1998, 3, 247).This paper discusses why the optimum for surfactant-enhanced spreading requires an initial macroscopic three-phase contact angle of 60 ± 5°. An equation based on experimental evidence allows for the calculation of the surface tension gradient over time using data on the spreading rate, spreading macroscopic contact angle, and droplet spreading radius. This novel approach for estimating the surface tension gradient and explaining the optimum substrate wettability underscores the role of the surface tension gradient, viscosity, and substrate wettability in surfactant-enhanced spreading on solids. The roles of the spreading three-phase contact angle and surface tension gradient in surfactant-enhanced spreading were analyzed, demonstrating that the surface tension gradient contributes more significantly to the spreading rate than the contact angle. Fingering instability formation, an instability at the droplet spreading edge caused by the Marangoni stresses, also serves as evidence of the role that the surface tension gradient plays in surfactant-enhanced spreading. Furthermore, applications of surfactant-enhanced spreading were demonstrated, suggesting potential uses in oil spill removal, leaf pesticide delivery, and oil spill remediation. The goal of the proposed study is to use experimental evidence to develop a model for calculating the optimum spreading rate during the first several seconds of surfactant-enhanced spreading on a solid substrate. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",NA,186

Previously, plant virus nanoparticles have been shown to penetrate soil and deliver agrochemicals for the treatment of plant parasitic nematodes. For example, tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) can be functionalized with agrochemicals through bioconjugation, infusion at the coat protein interface, or encapsulation through thermal shapeshifting (rod-to-sphere). There continues to be a need to expand approaches for agrochemical display and delivery with a need for plug-and-play technology to be applicable for multiple nanoparticle platforms and agrochemicals. Toward this goal, we turned toward a bio-specific coupling strategy making use of the biotin-(strept)avidin system. Herein, we conjugated TMGMV with either avidin or biotin using azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The avidin/biotin-functionalized TMGMV nanoparticles were then characterized by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy to confirm cargo loading and the nanoparticle’s structural integrity. Soil column assays confirmed that soil mobility was maintained upon chemical modification. Ivermectin modified with biotin or streptavidin linkers was then introduced to the TMGMV-avidin/biotin nanoparticles and binding propensity and loading were validated by QCM-D and a competitive ELISA. Finally, the ivermectin-loaded TMGMV nanoparticles were used to treat C. elegans in a gel burrowing assay, demonstrating that either pesticide loading strategy resulted in active TMGMV nanoparticle formulation that significantly reduced the mobility of nematodes, even after passing through soil. In stark contrast, free ivermectin only exhibited efficacy when applied directly to nematodes; the free pesticide was lost in the soil column—highlighting the need for a delivery system. The presented approach provides a facile plug-and-play approach for pesticide loading onto TMGMV nanoparticles. In particular, biotinylated TMGMV with streptavidin-conjugated ivermectin served as the most effective formulation. Importantly this method does not require heat, which contrasts our previous method of thermal reshaping that requires sample and pesticide exposure to temperatures > 96 °C. We envision the bio-specific loading strategy could be extended to other protein or inorganic nanoparticles to advance soil treatment strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,187

It was found that fluchlordiniliprole's adsorption and desorption in these soils were consistent with the Freundlich isotherm, exhibiting adsorption capacities (KF-ads) ranging from 8.436 to 36.269. Temperature fluctuations, encompassing both high and low extremes, impaired the ability of soil to adsorb fluchlordiniliprole. In addition, adsorption dynamics were modulated by several other factors, including soil pH, ionic strength, amendments (e.g., biochar and humic substances), and the presence of various surfactants and microplastics. Although capable of leaching, fluchlordiniliprole exhibited weak mobility in most soils. Therefore, it appears that fluchlordiniliprole seems to pose a threat to surface soil and aquatic biota, but a minimal threat to groundwater. Synopsis Statement: This research examines the dynamics of fluchlordiniliprole in soil, an will aid in maintaining ecological safety and managing agricultural pesticides.

These liquid colloidal systems are distinguished by their tiny size, usually less than 100 nm. They are less viscous, optically transparent, thermodynamically most stable formulations and facilitate to administer both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs of interest because of their enhanced bioavailability, absorption behavior, capacity to emulsify weakly water-soluble compounds, and enhanced shelf life. Phytogenic microemulsions address the limitations of conventional insecticides, which typically have poorly water-soluble active ingredients, harm the environment, human health, and non-target organisms, and foster resistance in targeted species. Therefore, phytogenic microemulsions are regarded as excellent and safe delivery systems for insecticidal formulations. This instructional review offers a thorough insight of the current status of the MEs as novel drug delivery systems against the vectors, agricultural pests, and insects of major concern thereby addressing global challenges.

Many adjuvants which modify the emulsion or extensional viscosity of the tank-mixture have been found to offer benefits in drift management, primarily by eliminating or reducing the ‘Fine’ droplets included in the spray with diameters <100–200 μm that can move off-target in unfavorable conditions during ground, airblast and aerial pesticide applications. Among wind tunnel and field studies conducted around the world, there is consensus that while some adjuvants are effective for drift management, the performance varies on a case-by-case basis, requiring verification for each adjuvant which could be achieved through a programme such as certification based on showing a reduction in Fine droplets and/or a reduction in airborne drift. These can be measured in wind tunnel studies according to international standards. This article provides a review of the current science in this subject area, from the approaches to data collection to a review of existing data and regulatory application for encouraging and rewarding the use of appropriate adjuvants that have been demonstrated to reduce airborne spray drift potential and therefore the size of no-spray buffer zones appropriate to protect nontarget sensitive areas from drift exposure. Some adjuvants can offer the same reduction in drift as offered by hooded sprayer retrofits. A drift reduction programme based on adjuvant use could include testing candidate adjuvants for their effect on droplet size and reduction in Fine droplets when sprayed through reference nozzles and compared against sprays without the adjuvant. Testing could also be based alternatively on measurements of drift potential on collectors such as monofilament line in wind tunnel or field studies. Once shown to be effective in reducing ‘Fines’ or spray drift, adjuvants could be certified and then referenced on pesticide labels and/or regulatory or best management practice schemes to encourage their use and offer reductions in use restrictions or no-spray buffer zone sizes based on drift management. Studies have shown that some adjuvants can reduce pesticide leaching into soils and contamination of groundwater, as well as runoff of active ingredients from plants into the environment. Performance depends on the adjuvant type, the pesticide with which it is used, the soil or plant type, the timing and mass of water input from rainfall and climatic factors. © 2024 The Author(s).

Even less-explored are the effects of commercial insecticides formulated with more than one active product. Short- and long-term lethal and sublethal effects were studied for the first time on the progeny of commercial formulations of spirotetramat, imidacloprid and a commercial mixture of these active ingredients on pupae of Diaeretiella rapae (M'ntosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), an endoparasitoid of aphids considered to be a potential biological control agent. Insecticides were exposed topically on aphid mummies in which the parasitoid was in the pupal stage. RESULTS: Imidacloprid reduced adult emergence by more than 30% and prolonged intra-host development time with respect to control from half the maximum recommended field dose (MFRD). Spirotetramat and commercial mixture only showed significant effects on these endpoints at doses above the MFRD. The tested formulations did not affect adult longevity, sex ratio, and percentage of parasitism in the exposed generation. At low concentrations the active ingredients in the commercial mixture behave synergistically, whereas at medium and high concentrations they behave antagonistically. Considering the 10% lethal dose (LD10), imidacloprid showed the highest hazard coefficient, whereas the commercial mixture was more hazardous when considering the LD50 and LD90. The commercial mixture and imidacloprid induced higher adult emergence and altered the sex ratio in the progeny. CONCLUSIONS: The following order of toxicity on D. rapae can be established: imidacloprid > commercial mixture > spirotetramat.

Sublethal exposure to pesticides is known to trigger hormetic responses in pests. However, the simultaneous effects of temperature and sublethal exposure to single or mixture-based insecticides on the insects’ stimulatory responses are not frequently considered in toxicological studies. Here we investigated the combined effects of temperature on the lethal and sublethal responses of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae after exposure to commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam) and a pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin) and their mixture. Firstly, the concentration-response curves of the insecticides were determined under four temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, and 28 °C) by the leaf dipping method. Subsequently, the sublethal concentrations C0, CL1, CL5, CL10, CL15, CL20, and CL30 were selected to assess sublethal effects on aphids’ longevity and reproduction under the same temperatures. The results showed that the mixture of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin caused greater toxicity to aphids compared to the formulations with each active ingredient alone and that the toxicity was higher at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the exposure to low concentrations of the mixture (thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin) and the separated insecticides induced stimulatory responses in the longevity and fecundity of exposed aphid females, but the occurrence of such hormetic responses depended on the insecticide type, its sublethal concentration, and the temperature as well as their interactions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",NA,192

These agrochemicals pollute the environment and can negatively impact human health, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Acetamiprid, an approved neonicotinoid pesticide in the EU, may exert sub-lethal effects on pollinators and other organisms. However, our knowledge on the scope and severity of such effects is still incomplete. Our experiments focused on the effects of the insecticide formulation Mospilan (active ingredient: 20% acetamiprid) on the peripheral olfactory detection of a synthetic floral blend and foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers. We found that the applied treatment did not affect the antennal detection of the floral blend; however, it induced alterations in their foraging behaviour. Pesticide-treated individuals started foraging later, and the probability of finding the floral blend was lower than that of the control bumblebees. However, exposed bumblebees found the scent source faster than the controls. These results suggest that acetamiprid-containing Mospilan may disrupt the activity and orientation of foraging bumblebees. We hypothesize that the observed effects of pesticide exposure on foraging behaviour could be mediated through neurophysiological and endocrine mechanisms. We propose that future investigations should clarify whether such sub-lethal effects can affect pollinators’ population dynamics and their ecosystem services. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,193

So in recent decades, biopesticides have gained traction in the pest management industry and have long been touted as potential substitutes for synthetic pesticides. Numerous characteristics of biopesticides, such as their host specificity, low levels of toxic residues, lack of phytotoxicity, and safety for humans, make them excellent choices for environmentally friendly agriculture. However, they find it challenging to compete with synthetic compounds in the marketplace due to their solubility, photolysis, relative instability, and greater price. To make biopesticides as effective as synthetic chemical pesticides, it is now essential to develop sophisticated biopesticide formulations. Recently, the creation of new nanomaterials has opened up new possibilities for creating innovative biopesticide formulations and enhancing their effectiveness in semi-field or laboratory settings. Most of the nanocomposites being researched for nano-biopesticides are designed to enhance formulation qualities such as permeability, controlled release, thermal and photostability, and crystallinity. Nano-biopesticides can be produced by loading active ingredients of biopesticides into nanocarriers through encapsulation, absorption, attachment, or entrapment. The various kinds of nanocarriers, including metal, metal oxides, non-metal oxides, polymers, carbon, lipids, etc., are employed in biopesticide formulations and create nano-biopesticides. In this connection, this review covers various aspects related to nanocarriers for nano-biopesticide formulations, such as preparation techniques and their value in controlling pests. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,195

The commercial formulation COLOSSO FC30, which contains three active ingredients (Cypermethrin, Chlorpyrifos, and Fenthion), stands out due to its efficiency. However, animals exposed to this product may become vectors of potentially toxic molecules, possibly causing contamination in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In light of this, this study evaluated the eco(geno)toxic potential of the commercial formulation COLOSSO FC30, using plants (Allium cepa L., Lactuca sativa L., Raphanus sativus L., Pennisetum glaucum L., and Triticum aestivum L.) and Artemia salina L. as model organisms. In the phytotoxicity test, the species were ranked in order of sensitivity to the commercial formulation as follows: P. glaucum > L. sativa > T. aestivum > R. sativus. The most sensitive parameters were root length (RL) and shoot length (SL) of seedlings. In the cytogenotoxicity test with A. cepa, cell division was decreased at concentrations from 0.351 mL L−1 in the meristematic region and root F1. Chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus were observed at all concentrations. In the test with A. salina, the IC50 after 24 h of exposure was 0.01207 mL L−1 of the commercial formulation.

Herein, a hydrophilic and lipophilic diblock polymer (HLDP) is designed and synthesized to prepare a series of HLDP nano-protectants to explore the best HLDP nano-protectant for anthracnose management. These results demonstrate that the HLDP-CS nano-protectant displays the best control effects on mango anthracnose via the direct pathogen inhibition and amplified plant immune responses. The HLDP can be spontaneously conjugated with CS into nanoscale spherical particles through hydrophobic interaction. The complexation of CS with HLDP remarkably improves the deposition and adhesion of CS droplets on mango leaves. The HLDP can interact with mycelium via electrostatic interaction to damage the cell wall/membrane, which can act as an AI to directly suppress the spore germination and mycelial growth. Meanwhile, HLDP can be applied as an adjuvant for CS to amplify the plant immune responses via accelerating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormones.

The aim of the PTs was to determine the amount of active ingredient in various formulations of PPPs. Overall, the type of formulations to be analysed were soluble concentrate (SL), suspension concentrate (SC), capsule suspension (CS), emulsion water oil (EW), soluble water granule (SG), dustable powder (DP), water dispersible granule (WDG) and emulsion concentrate (EC). In 2021, the ISS organised PTs for the determination of Imazamox, Fenhexamid and Trinexapac-ethyl in three different PPPs as soluble concentrate (SL), suspension concentrate (SC), and capsule suspension (CS), respectively. In 2022, PTs for the determination of Bentazone, Spinosad and Tau-Fluvalinate were organised. For this PTs, commercial PPPs were obtained from the Italian market as SC, emulsion oil water (EW) and soluble water granule (SG). In 2023, the PT was organised to determine the active ingredient Trifloxystrobin, Deltamethrin and Cyprodinil in the commercial product as water dispersible granule (WDG), dustable powder (DP) and emulsion concentrate (EC), respectively.

Early diagnosis and treatment of plant disease is necessary to achieve high yield and quality, as plant disease is the main cause of low yield and quality. However, standard methods (nucleic acid and antibody-based molecular assays etc.) for diagnosing plant disease still suffer from complex and laborious analysis procedures. Meanwhile, pesticides and fertilizers for treating plant disease also face concerns about low utilization rates. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel methods to address these concerns. Recently, nanotechnology has been attracting attention in plant disease management. Nanomaterials, as its integral portion, are expected to overcome the abovementioned application deficiencies. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in nanomaterials applied to plant health monitoring and disease treatment. First, the mechanism of nanosensors to monitor plant health is discussed and its advantages over traditional detection devices are highlighted. Then, the therapeutic effects of nanopesticides/fertilizers are discussed and their use to mitigate the loss of active ingredients (AIs) is emphasized. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for the development of nanomaterials in plant health monitoring for yield improvement are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,199

Nevertheless, there is a limited number of studies that address the actual toxic effects of herbicides on insects. This study investigated the side effects of herbicides on non-target organisms inhabiting agroecosystems and performing essential ecological and economic functions such as crop pollination. We analysed morphological alterations in the gut, Malpighian tubules and circulating haemocytes of Apis mellifera workers as markers of exposure effects. A commercial formulation of a pendimethalin-based herbicide (PND) was administered orally under laboratory conditions at a realistic concentration admitted in the field (330gL−1 of active ingredient., 4 L ha−1 for cereal and vegetable crops). The worker bees were exposed to a single application of PND for a period of one week, to simulate the exposure that can occur when foraging bees accidentally drink drops of contaminated water upon treatments. Histopathological analyses of the midgut, ileum and Malpighian tubules showed alterations over time (from 24 to 72 h after the beginning of exposure) such as loss of epithelial organisation, cellular vacuolisation and altered pyknotic nuclei as well as disruption of the peritrophic membrane over time. Semiquantitative analyses of the midgut showed a significant increase in the organ injury index 24 and 72 h after the initial exposure in PND-exposed bees compared to control bees. In addition, a change in positivity to Gram staining was observed in the midgut histological sections. A recovery of cytotoxic effects was observed one week after the initial exposure, which was favoured by the periodic renewal of the intestinal epithelium and the herbicide dissipation time. Cytochemical staining with Giemsa of haemocytes from PND-treated workers over 24 and 72 h showed significant nuclear alterations such as lobed or polymorphic nuclei and micronuclei compared to bees in the control group. These results show that the dose of PND used to protect crops from weeds can lead to significant cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in non-target organisms such as honey bees. In croplands, the sublethal effects on cell morphology can impair vital physiological processes such as nutrition, osmoregulation, and resistance to pathogens, contributing to the decline in biodiversity and abundance of species that play a prominent ecological role, such as pollinators. © 2024",NA,201

However, the size effect of nanopesticides remains unclear, and its underlying mechanisms of influence have become a major obstacle in the design and application of pesticide nanoformulations. In this research, the noncarrier-coated emamectin benzoate (EB) solid dispersions (Micro-EB and Nano-EB) were produced under a constant surfactant-to-active ingredient ratio by a self-emulsifying-carrier solidification technique. The particle size of Micro-EB was 162 times that of spherical Nano-EB. The small size and large specific surface area of Nano-EB facilitated the adsorption of surfactants on the surface of the particles, thereby improving its dispersibility, suspensibility, and stability. The pinning effect of nanoparticles significantly suppressed droplet retraction and rebounding. Moreover, Nano-EB exhibited a 25% higher retention of the active ingredient on cabbage leaves and a 70% higher washing resistance than Micro-EB, and both were significantly different. The improvement of abilities in wetting, spreading, and retention of Nano-EB on crop leaves contributed to the increase in foliar utilization, which further resulted in a 1.6-fold enhancement of bioactivity against target Spodoptera exigua compared to Micro-EB. Especially, Nano-EB did not exacerbate the safety risk to the nontarget organism zebrafish with no significant difference.

Fungicide triazoles and strobilurins based are the most widely used and require a specific effort to investigate toxicological effects on non-target species. This study evaluates the toxic effects of four commercial fungicides Prosaro® (tebuconazole and prothioconazole), Amistar®Xtra (azoxystrobin and cyproconazole), Mirador® (azoxystrobin) and Icarus® (Tebuconazole) on Eisenia fetida using several biomarkers: lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), total glutathione (GSHt), DNA fragmentation (comet assay) and lysozyme activity tested for the first time in E. fetida. The exposure to Mirador® and AmistarXtra® caused an imbalance of ROS species, leading to the inhibition of the immune system. AmistarXtra® and Prosaro®, composed of two active ingredients, induced significant DNA alteration, indicating genotoxic effects. This study broadened our knowledge of the effects of pesticide product formulations on earthworms and showed the need for improvement in the evaluation of toxicological risk deriving from the changing of physicochemical and toxicological properties that occur when a commercial formulation contains more than one active ingredient and several unknown co-formulants. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,203

The GBH crop spraying, dedicated to genetically engineered GLP-resistant crops, has revolutionized modern agriculture by increasing the production yield. However, abusively administered GBHs’ ingredients, e.g., GLP, polyoxyethyleneamine, and heavy metals, have polluted environmental and industrial areas far beyond farmlands, causing global contamination and life-threatening risk, which has led to the recent local bans of GBH use. Moreover, preclinical and clinical reports have demonstrated harmful impacts of GLP and other GBH ingredients on the gut microbiome, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and endocrine, as well as reproductive, and cardiopulmonary systems, whereas carcinogenicity of these herbicides remains controversial. Occupational exposure to GBH dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, responsible for steroidogenesis and endocrinal secretion, thus affecting hormonal homeostasis, functions of reproductive organs, and fertility. On the other hand, acute intoxication with GBH, characterized by dehydration, oliguria, paralytic ileus, as well as hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, may occur fatally. As no antidote has been developed for GBH poisoning so far, the detoxification is mainly symptomatic and supportive and requires intensive care based on gastric lavage, extracorporeal blood filtering, and intravenous lipid emulsion infusion. The current review comprehensively discusses the molecular and physiological basics of the GLP- and/or GBH-induced diseases of the endocrine and reproductive systems, and cardiopulmonary-, nephro-, and hepatotoxicities, presented in recent preclinical studies and case reports on the accidental or intentional ingestions with the most popular GBHs. Finally, they briefly describe modern and future healthcare methods and tools for GLP detection, determination, and detoxification. Future electronically powered, decision-making, and user-friendly devices targeting major GLP/GBH’s modes of actions, i.e., dysbiosis and the inhibition of AChE, shall enable self-handled or point-of-care professional-assisted evaluation of the harm followed with rapid capturing GBH xenobiotics in the body and precise determining the GBH pathology-associated biomarkers levels. © 2024 The Authors.

In this work, the water/liquid crystal (W/LC) emulsion is obtained via dispersing an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and peroxidase from horseradish (HRP) into a water-immiscible nematic LC and employed as a sensing platform for the detection of dichlorvos (2, 2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate, DDVP) that is a typical OP with acute toxicity. Remarkably, the stepwise release of the encapsulated cargo HRP from the W/LC emulsion can be triggered upon the addition of the cationic surfactant myristoylcholine chloride (Myr) due to the strong interfacial charge interactions with the anionic surfactant SDS. The released HRP induces an obvious color change of the overlaying bulk aqueous solution via the H2O2-HRP-TMB reaction system. As Myr can be enzymatically cleaved by AChE, the detection of AChE is fulfilled successfully. This approach is also employed to detect DDVP that can irreversibly inhibit the activity of AChE. This assay shows a linear response between the absorbance of the oxidized TMB solution and the DDVP concentration in the range of 0.001–10 μg/mL (R2 = 0.99). The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantity (LOQ) of DDVP are determined to be 1.9 ng/mL and 6.3 ng/mL, respectively. In addition, this strategy also demonstrates excellent performance for the DDVP detection in real samples, the detection recovery rate of DDVP in water samples (lake water and tap water) and vegetables (tomatoes and cole) by this method is 88.0 % ∼112.6 %, the relative standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 7.5 %. These results suggest the W/LC emulsion-based sensing platform shows great potential for visual detection of DDVP in real samples. In conclusion, the proposed approach is scalable for practical application in food safety as well as environmental monitoring fields, and will provide promising solutions for the assay of pesticide residues. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,205

Here, we examined the interaction between the agricultural fungicide Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) and high temperatures on critical honeybee behaviours. We have previously shown that consumption of field-realistic levels of this fungicide shortens worker lifespan in the field and impairs associative learning performance in a laboratory-based assay. We hypothesized that Pristine would also impair homing and foraging behaviours in the field, and that an interaction with hot weather would exacerbate this effect. Both field-relevant Pristine exposure and higher air temperatures reduced the probability of successful return on their own. Together, the two factors synergistically reduced the probability of return and increased the time required for bees to return to the hive. Pristine did not affect the masses of pollen or volumes of nectar or water brought back to the hive by foragers, and it did not affect the ratio of forager types in a colony. However, Pristine-fed bees brought more concentrated nectar back to the hive. As both agrochemical usage and heat waves increase, additive and synergistic negative effects may pose major threats to pollinators and sustainable agriculture.  © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,206

There is evidence that some second-generation insecticide-treated nets, which combine insecticide formulations with different modes of action, are protective against malaria while the nets are new; however, evidence for their impact over 3 years is scarce. In this study, we report the third-year results of a cluster-randomised controlled trial assessing the long-term effectiveness of dual-active ingredient long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomised controlled trial, carried out between May 23, 2019, and April 30, 2023, in southern Benin. Restricted randomisation was used to assign 60 clusters (villages or groups of villages with a minimum of 100 households) to the three study groups (1:1:1) to evaluate the efficacy of pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLINs and chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLINs compared with pyrethroid-only LLINs (reference) against malaria transmission. The study staff and communities were masked to the group allocation. The primary outcome was malaria incidence measured over the third year after LLIN distribution, in a cohort of children aged 6 months to 9 years at the time of enrolment, in the intention-to-treat population. Here, we present the data of the third year post-LLIN distribution. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03931473. Findings: Study net use declined over the 3 years and was consistently lowest in the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group (at 36 months: 889 [39·4%] of 2257 participants vs 1278 [52·2%] of 2450 participants for the chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLIN group and 1400 [57·6%] of 2430 participants for the pyrethroid-only LLIN group). The cohort of children for the third year of follow-up (600 per group) were enrolled between April 9 and 30, 2022. Mean malaria incidence during the third year after distribution was 1·19 cases per child-year (95% CI 1·09–1·29) in the pyrethroid-only LLIN reference group, 1·21 cases per child-year (1·12–1·31) in the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·02, 95% CI 0·71–1·44; p=0·92), and 0·96 cases per child-year (0·88–1·05) in the chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLIN group (HR 0·80, 0·56–1·17; p=0·25). No adverse events related to study nets were reported by participants. Interpretation: During the third year, as was also observed during the first 2 years, the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group did not have superior protection against malaria cases compared with the standard LLIN group. In the third year, people living in the chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLIN group no longer benefited from greater protection against malaria cases and infections than those living in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group. This was probably influenced by lower study net use than previous years and the declining concentration of partner insecticides in the nets. Funding: UNITAID, The Global Fund.

Recently, interactive effects of multiple agrochemicals on bees have been highlighted, including fungicides, which increase toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we use a semi-field study across two seasons in controlled foraging tunnels to test the effects of a field application of a commercial fungicide product with two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin and metconazole) applied at label rates. We also examine its interactive effects with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, at a conservative field-realistic dose of 2.23 ppb, on 48 honey bee colonies. We found combined effects of pesticide exposure, including additive 2.93-fold increases in mortality, and an additional effect of increased infestation levels of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Pesticide treatments also reduced colony activity, reduced colony weight, and increased sugar consumption of whole colonies. These findings indicate that typical sublethal exposure levels to common, co-occurring agrochemicals in the field significantly affect the health of whole honey bee colonies, highlighting an unintended consequence of increasing pesticide applications. © 2024 The Author(s)",NA,208

Our work aimed to evaluate the acute (survival) and chronic (regeneration, locomotion, and reproduction) toxicity of chlorpyrifos to the non-target freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina. The 48 h lethal concentration (LC50) of the commercial formulation, containing 480 g L−1 of chlorpyrifos, the active ingredient, was determined to be 622.8 µg a.i. L−1 for planarians. Sublethal effects were translated into a significant reduction in locomotion and delayed head regeneration (lowest observed effect concentration—LOEC = 3.88 µg a.i. L−1). Additionally, chlorpyrifos exposure did not affect planarian fecundity or fertility. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of chlorpyrifos-based insecticides to harm natural populations of freshwater planarians at environmentally relevant concentrations. The observed toxicity emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and careful management of chlorpyrifos usage to mitigate its deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems.

Nevertheless, topical delivery of dsRNAs to sap-sucking insects is a major challenge due to the insufficient infiltration and translocation to plant vascular. Foliar sprayed layered double hydroxide (LDH) showed insufficient translocation in plant vascular and the supplement of surfactants caused phytotoxicity to plant. Thus, in the present study, LDH was transformed from hydrophilic to amphiphilic by fatty acids modification to obtain a surfactant-like LDH (LDHS) with good leaf adhesion, translocation and excellent biocompatibility. LDHS was synthesized via a mild hydrothermal method using MgCl2, FeCl3 and palm oil as the precursors, resulting in LDH coated with long-chained carboxylates as hydrophobic tails. LDHS showed good binding affinity with dsRNA and high affinity to rice leaves. Once loaded with dsRNA, LDHS were shown to enhance the uptake of dsRNA to rice brown planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens) through a direct spray. Moreover, in planta, dsRNA-LDHS exhibited translocation from rice leaves to vascular bundles and finally into the planthoppers, delivered 2.5-fold higher dsRNA and caused higher mortalities of planthoppers than hydrophilic LDH with adjuvants. Herein we generate and validate a platform that can deliver dsRNA through either direct sprays or sprayed living plant to brown planthoppers with high efficiency, low toxicity and adjuvant-free. Consequently, it is a green potential selection using amphiphilic LDHS agents instead of the conventional gene carriers to prepare biopesticide nanoparticles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,213

These have allowed us to evaluate the knockdown time affecting 50% of the individuals (KT50). In addition, the type of interaction between the components in each mixture was established in terms of the combination index (IC). The KT50 values were 6.07; 8.83; 7.17 and 27.23 h for linalool, 1,8 -cineole, eugenol, and thymol, respectively. For the eugenol:linalool mixtures, the efficacy was lower or equal to that obtained for the nanoformulations of the pure compounds, with values of KT50 about 13.33, 8.16 and 6.71 h for mixtures with ratios 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, respectively. These mixtures present IC > 1, evidencing antagonistic interaction, which is enhanced with eugenol content. In the case of the binary mixtures of 1,8 -cineole: linalool, KT50 values were similar to those obtained for eugenol:linalool mixtures with similar ratios. In this case, IC assumes values close to unity, suggesting additive interactions independently of the mixture composition. On the other side, mixtures of eugenol:thymol with 1:1 and 1:3 ratios showed values of 9.40 and 32.93 h, while the mixture with a 3:1 ratio showed the greatest effectiveness (KT50 of 4.42 h). Eugenol:thymol mixtures show synergistic interaction (IC < 1) for combinations 3:1 and 1:1, while no interaction was observed for 1:3 combination. This indicates that eugenol enhances thymol activity. These results must be considered an important step forward to the development of effective pediculicidal nanoformulations based on botanical compounds. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,214

Skin decontamination is essential to avoid irreversible effects. Fuller's earth (FE), a phyllosilicate conventionally employed in powder form, has demonstrated decontamination capacity against OPs. The aim of this study was to develop a formulation that forms a film on the skin, with a significant OP removal capacity (>95 %) coupled with sequestration capabilities, favorable drying time and mechanical properties to allow for easy application and removal, particularly in emergency context. Various formulations were prepared using different concentrations of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), FE and surfactants. Their removal and sequestration capacity was tested using paraoxon-ethyl (POX), a chemical that simulates the behavior of VX. Formulations with removal capacity levels surpassing 95 % were mechanically characterized and cell viability assays were performed on Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast (NHDF). The four most promising formulations were used to assess decontamination efficacy on pig ear skin explants. These formulations showed decontamination levels ranging from 84.4 ± 4.7 % to 96.5 ± 1.3 %, which is equivalent to current decontamination methods.

We hypothesize that a continuous flow of oil through nanopores into water in combination with a given ultrasound energy can generate stable free standing oil emulsions in water in the absence of surfactants. Experiment: An oil solution was pumped through a membrane with 100 nm pores at a controlled flow rate and introduced into an aqueous solution while being subjected to sonication. The resulting emulsion samples were collected at specific time intervals and characterized by dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis techniques. We evaluated the storage stability of the emulsions with and without surfactant at room temperature or 4 °C storage. Results: Introducing oil into an aqueous phase using our Nanopore system in conjunction with ultrasound gave rise to surfactant-free milky oil nanodroplet solutions. Dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that the produced surfactant-free oil nanodroplets were monodispersed in water at sizes less than 200 nm. Control experiments without the use of nanopores did not result in phase mixing. Nanoemulsions were also generated in a surfactant containing solution resulting in a similar size range of nanodroplets. This work demonstrates that our Nanopore system can generate stable nanoemulsions in the absence of a surfactant, persisting in phase separation for several days up to two weeks at room temperature and 4 °C storage. This work suggests that nanopores are effective in producing surfactant-free nanoemulsions, which offer a wide range of valuable applications varying from drug delivery and food engineering, to paints and pesticide development. © 2024 The Author(s)",NA,217

Novel bioproducts for crop management are called to guarantee sustainable antagonism activity of BCAs and increase the acceptance of the farmers. The encapsulation in polymeric matrices play a prominent role for providing an effective carrier/protector and long-lasting bioproduct. This research aimed to study the influence of biopolymer in hydrogel capsules on survival and shelf-life of T. koningiopsis. Thus, two hydrogel capsules prototypes based on alginate (P1) and amidated pectin (P2), containing conidia of T. koningiopsis Th003 were formulated. Capsules were prepared by the ionic gelation method and calcium gluconate as crosslinker. Conidia releasing under different pH values of the medium, survival of conidia in drying capsules, storage stability, and biocontrol activity against rice sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) were studied. P2 prototype provided up to 98% survival to Th003 in fluid bed drying, faster conidia releasing at pH 5.8, storage stability greater than 6 months at 18 °C, and up to 67% of disease reduction. However, both biopolymers facilitate the antagonistic activity against R. solani, and therefore can be incorporated in novel hydrogel capsules-based biopreparations.

Within this context, this study aimed at the interaction between a biological control agent such as Trichoderma harzianum CCT 2160 (BF-Th) and the biosurfactants (BSs) derived from the native Brazilian yeast Starmerella bombicola UFMG-CM-Y6419. Thereafter, their potential in germination of Oryza sativa L. seeds was tested. Both bioproducts were produced on site and characterized according to their chemical composition by HPLC-MS and GC-MS for BSs and SDS-PAGE gel for BF-Th. The BSs were confirmed to be sophorolipids (SLs) which is a well-studied compound with antimicrobial activity. The biocompatibility was examined by cultivating the fungus with SLs supplementation ranging from 0.1 to 2 g/L in solid and submerged fermentation. In solid state fermentation the supplementation of SLs enhanced spore production, conferring the synergy of both bioproducts. For the germination assays, bioformulations composed of SLs, BF-Th and combined (SLT) were applied in the germination of O. sativa L seeds achieving an improvement of up to 30% in morphological aspects such as root and shoot size as well as the presence of lateral roots. It was hypothesized that SLs were able to regulate phytohormones expression such as auxins and gibberellins during early stage of growth, pointing to their novel plant-growth stimulating properties.

In contrast, the photocatalytic method harnesses light energy to degrade pollutants, boasting low energy consumption and high efficiency. Nevertheless, traditional photocatalysts suffer from limited light responsiveness, inadequate adsorption capabilities, susceptibility to agglomeration, and hydrophilicity, thereby curtailing their practical utility. Consequently, integrating appropriate carriers with traditional photocatalysts becomes imperative. The combination of chitosan and semiconductor materials stands out by reducing band gap energy, augmenting reactive sites, mitigating carrier recombination, bolstering structural stability, and notably advancing the photocatalytic degradation of printing and dyeing wastewater. This study embarks on an exploration by initially elucidating the technical principles, merits, and demerits of prevailing printing and dyeing wastewater treatment methodologies, with a focal emphasis on the photocatalytic approach.

Traditional nematicides and other nematode control methods are being used against PPNs. However, stakeholders are searching for more sustainable and effective alternatives with limited side effects on the environment and mankind to face increased food demand, unfavorable climate change, and using unhealthy nematicides. This review focuses on upgrading the pre-procedures of PPN control as well as novel measures for their effective and durable management strategies on economically important crops. Sound and effective sampling, extraction, identification, and counting methods of PPNs and their related microorganisms, in addition to perfecting designation of nematode–host susceptibility/resistance, form the bases for these strategies. Therefore, their related frontiers should be expanded to synthesize innovative integrated solutions for these strategies. The latter involve supplanting unsafe nematicides with a new generation of safe and reliable chemical nematicidal and bionematicidal alternatives. For better efficacy, nematicidal materials and techniques should be further developed via computer-aided nematicide design. Bioinformatics devices can reinforce the potential of safe and effective biocontrol agents (BCAs) and their active components. They can delineate the interactions of bionematicides with their targeted PPN species and tackle complex diseases. Also, the functional plan of nematicides based on a blueprint of the intended goals should be further explored. Such goals can currently engage succinate dehydrogenase, acetylcholinesterase, and chitin deacetylase. Nonetheless, other biochemical compounds as novel targets for nematicides should be earnestly sought. Commonly used nematicides should be further tested for synergistic or additive function and be optimized via novel sequential, dual-purpose, and co-application of agricultural inputs, especially in integrated pest management schemes. Future directions and research priorities should address this novelty. Meanwhile, emerging bioactivated nematicides that offer reliability and nematode selectivity should be advanced for their favorable large-scale synthesis. Recent technological means should intervene to prevail over nematicide-related limitations. Nanoencapsulation can challenge production costs, effectiveness, and manufacturing defects of some nematicides. Recent progress in studying molecular plant–nematode interaction mechanisms can be further exploited for novel PPN control given related topics such as interfering RNA techniques, RNA-Seq in BCA development, and targeted genome editing. A few recent materials/techniques for control of PPNs in durable agroecosystems via decision support tools and decision support systems are addressed.

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS: We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION: We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and “inert” ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of “inert” ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Then, the application effect of the slow-releasing nanoparticles loading with the above two chemical pesticides was evaluated by field experiments for ultimately obtaining the control plan for A. citricola.【Methods】Indoor bioassay was carried out by leaf dipping method. Experimental insects were gathered from apple trees in the greenhouse of Dongyang Experimental Base, Shanxi Agricultural University, which were not treated with any pesticides. Four combinations of abamectin and dinotefuran were set up by the active ingredient ratios of 1∶2, 1∶4, 1∶8 and 1∶16. Firstly, fresh and tender leaves were immersed in the insecticide solutions for 5 seconds, and then moved back up into a petri dish covered with wet filter paper. Secondly, healthy adult aphids were chosen and placed to the leaf surface for incubation, and the mortality was recorded after 24 hours of feeding. The co-toxicity of abamectin and dinotefuran to A. citricola was evaluated by Sun Yunpei's co-toxicity coefficient method. Based on the co-toxicity results, two field trials were conducted to evaluate the control effects in April and June, 2021, in Yuncheng City, Shanxi province. Five treatments were set up in each experiment. There were three different doses of the compound (abamectin 5% EC and dinotefuran 20% SG) and two single insecticide (abamectin 5% EC or dinotefuran 20% SG). The three doses were 4, 9 and 13.5 mg. kg-1 at 1∶2 ratio, respectively; as well as 15, 20 and 22.5 mg. kg-1 at 1∶4 ratio, respectively. Water was set up as the control. Knapsack sprayer was used to evenly spray the apple tree with the amount of 2-3 L solution per tree. Each treatment had 4 replications, and there were 2 trees in each replication. The insect population number was investigated on the 3rd, 7th and 15th day after application. In addition, 2.25% abamectin. dinotefuran co-delivery nanoparticles formulation (2.25% DACNPs) at the ratio of 1∶4 was prepared and applied. The field experiment was carried out from May to June, 2022 in Linyi county, Shanxi province. Four treatments were designed for the experiment, including 2.25% DACNPs, the compound at 1∶4 ratio, and the addition of the additive GY-T1602 to both, respectively. It was applied twice during the occurrence period of aphids and the insect population was investigated on 7th and 15th day after each application. Finally, the population decline rates and the control effects were calculated. 【Results】When the compound ratio of abamectin and dinotefuran were at 1∶2, 1∶4 and 1∶8, the co-toxicity coefficients (CTC) on A. citricola were 251.61, 260.72 and 126.25, respectively. They were greater than 120, indicating that these ratios had synergistic effect on A. citricola. The LC50 of abamectin was 0.66 mg. L-1, while the dinotefuran was 106.44 mg. L-1. The LC50 of the combinations at the ratio of 1∶2 and 1∶4 were 0.75 and 1.28 mg. L-1, respectively. It showed that the combinations could enhance the toxicity of dinotefuran significantly. Field trials showed that, at the ratio of 1∶2, when the dosages were 4.5 and 9 mg. kg-1, the control effects against A. citricola in 7-15 days were only 51.69%-78.46%, significantly lower than those of any single agent. At the dosage of 13.5 mg. kg-1, the control effect was comparable to dinotefuran alone, but still lower than that of abamectin, and the difference among all of them was not significant. At the ratio of 1∶4, the control effects in 3 days were 91.44%-99.63% at the dosages of 15, 20 and 22.5 mg. kg-1, which were equivalent to or slightly higher than abamectin or dinotefuran alone. However, the combination could reduce the active constituent amount of abamectin or dinotefuran by the range of 10%-70%. Moreover, the control effect of 2.25% DACNPs against A. citricola in 7-15 days after the first application was 41.44%-64.58%, which was lower than that of the 1∶4 combination. After the secondary application, the control effect of 2.25% DACNPs in 7-15 days was 79.80%-91.65%, which was equivalent to the 1∶4 combination. The results also indicated that the 2.25% DACNPs had sustainable efficacy on the control against A. citricola. By adding adjuvant GYT1602, compared with the same treatment without the addition, the control effects were all improved to a certain degree, there were significant difference in the 7 days after the first application, but no significant difference existed in the other days. It indicated that adding adjuvant could improve the quick effect.【Conclusion】It is recommended to use 2.25% DACNPs in initial occurrence of A. citricola. However, the combination of abamectin and dinotefuran at the ratio of 1∶4 should be used in peak occurrence to reduce the insect population density quickly. Adding adjuvant GY-T1602 in the spray could obtain a higher efficacy, especially in the early control effect. © 2024 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica. All rights reserved.",NA,228

Despite rather high toxicity cationic surfactants are of importance as antimicrobial agents, gene nanocarriers and mitochondria targeted ligands. To minimize this limitation, cationic amphiphilic matrix undergoes modification with various functional groups. In this work, new piperidinium cationic surfactants containing one or two carbamate fragments were prepared; their aggregation behavior was systematically studied by tensiometery, spectrophotometry and fluorimetry. The presence of a carbamate fragment leads to a 2–3-fold decrease in critical micelle concentration and to a significant increase in solubilization capacity compared to unsubstituted analogue. Evaluation of the antimicrobial effect showed that all compounds exhibit high bactericidal and fungicidal activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, including their resistant forms. Importantly, the introducing carbamate moiety allows of decreasing hemolytic activity of cationic surfactants. The data obtained make it possible to recommend carbamate piperidinium surfactants as effective biocompatible and biodegradable nanocontainers for hydrophobic probes with high antimicrobial effect and moderate hemolytic activity. © 2023",NA,229

Although GLY/GBH was previously considered to be non-toxic, growing evidence indicates that GLY/GBH negatively affects some animal taxa. However, there has been no systematic analysis quantifying its toxicity to animals. Therefore, we used a meta-analytical approach to determine whether there is a demonstrable effect of GLY/GBH toxicity across animals. We further addressed whether the effects of GLY/GBH vary due to (1) taxon (invertebrate vs. vertebrate), (2) habitat (aquatic vs. terrestrial), (3) type of biological response (behavior vs. physiology vs. survival), and (4) dosage or concentration of GLY/GBH. Using this approach, we also determined whether adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) in commercial formulations of GBHs increased toxicity for animals relative to exposure to GLY alone. We analyzed 1282 observations from 121 articles. We conclude that GLY is generally sub-lethally toxic for animals, particularly for animals in aquatic or marine habitats, and that toxicity did not exhibit dose-dependency. Yet, our analyses detected evidence for widespread publication bias so we encourage continued experimental investigations to better understand factors influencing GLY/GBH toxicity to animals. © 2024 The Authors",NA,230

However, the efficacy of insecticide spraying is comparatively low, and adjuvants play a crucial role in optimizing insecticide performance. This study evaluated the impact of two adjuvants, sodium alginate (SA) and polyacrylamide (PAM), on enhancing the efficacy of bifenthrin and imidacloprid via laboratory spray bioassays. Both SA and PAM demonstrated insignificant variation in LC50 values with formulated bifenthrin and imidacloprid. However, SA and PAM exhibited synergistic effects with two technical-grade insecticides. High concentrations of PAM increased the efficacy of bifenthrin by 1.50- and 1.70-fold for L. lineolaris and P. guildinii, respectively. Conversely, no enhancement effect was observed for the SA–technical-grade bifenthrin combination against either insect pests. Additionally, both SA and PAM enhanced the effectiveness of imidacloprid in P. guildinii by up to 2.68- and 2.73-fold, respectively. While a high concentration of PAM had a 1.45-fold synergistic effect on technical-grade imidacloprid, no enhancement effect was observed for the SA/imidacloprid combination in L. lineolaris.

However, information regarding the use of these commonly practiced household insecticides is scarce in Sri Lanka. A questionnaire-based survey was directed to 600 households in Colombo, Gampaha, Kandy, Kalutara, Jaffna, and Galle districts in Sri Lanka. Household insecticides were used by the majority of the respondents (57.0%), and electric liquid vaporizers (46.7%) and mosquito coils (45.7%) were the commonly used forms. The active ingredients in mosquito coils were d-trans-allethrin (w/w 0.12%), metofluthrin (w/w 0.005%), and dimefluthrin (w/w 0.01%); in liquid vaporizers, they were prallethrin (w/v 1.24% and w/v 1.26%) and transfluthrin (w/v 0.9%). The majority of the household insecticide consumers were moderately satisfied with the effectiveness of the products (68.6%), and most of the participants used household insecticides daily (35.5%), especially during the evening (41.6%). Most of the consumers were unaware of the chemicals included in household insecticides (62.8%). Mosquito coils were abundantly used by rural area participants (75.8%), whereas liquid vaporizers were the most common among the urban participants (56.4%).

233,Lisa,NO,Straw E.A.,End co-formulant secrecy,2024,Environmental Science and Policy,154,NA,NA,10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103701,"Pesticides, widely used in modern agriculture, are applied in formulations that contain the main ingredient (active ingredient) and additional chemicals like solvents and surfactants (co-formulants). Both active ingredients and co-formulants can cause human and environmental toxicity. However, under European Union and United States law, the full details of the co-formulant composition are kept secret from the public and researchers. Only the producer and regulators know the full details. Here I argue that legislators should end ‘co-formulant secrecy’ and require all the ingredients in a pesticide be listed openly, including their concentrations. To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition. Further, patents are already utilised, so secrecy adds no additional benefit to industry. I argue that co-formulant secrecy only serves to stifle and limit the ability of independent scientists to conduct research. © 2024 The Authors",NA,233

Obtaining information regarding the fate of this a.i. in environmental matrices and its ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms is essential for the risk assessment of the herbicide. In this study, the effects of Merlin Flexx- and Merlin WG75 formulated isoxaflutole-based herbicide products and two selected additives (cyprosulfamide safener and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one antimicrobial agent) were investigated on Raphidocelis subcapitata in growth inhibition assays. In ecotoxicological tests, two conventional (optical density and chlorophyll-a content) and two induced fluorescence-based (Fv*/Fp: efficiency of the photosystem PSII and Rfd* changes in the observed ratio of fluorescence decrease) endpoints were determined by UV-spectrophotometer and by our FluoroMeter Module, respectively. Furthermore, dissipation of isoxaflutole alone and in its formulated products was examined by an HPLC-UV method. In ecotoxicological assays, the fluorescence-based Rfd* was observed as the most sensitive endpoint. In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole–safener–antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 ± 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i.

Silencing of genes essential for psyllids, or for Liberibacter, is anticipated to lead to mortality or impeded bacterial multiplication. Foliar delivery is preferred for biopesticide application; however, the cuticle impedes dsRNA penetration into the vasculature. Here, conditions were established for wounding tomato leaves using ultraviolet light amplification by stimulated emissions of radiation (UV-LASER) to promote dsRNA penetration into leaves and vasculature. RESULTS: UV-LASER treatment with application of select adjuvants/surfactants resulted in vascular delivery of 100-, 300- and 600-bp dsRNAs that, in general, were correlated with size. The 100-bp dsRNA required no pretreatment, whereas 300- and 600-bp dsRNAs entered the vasculature after UV-LASER treatment only and UV-LASER adjuvant/surfactant treatment, respectively. Of six adjuvant/surfactants evaluated, plant-derived oil combined with an anionic organosilicon compound performed most optimally. Localization of dsRNAs in the tomato vasculature was documented using fluorometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The biological activity of in planta-delivered dsRNA (200–250 bp) was determined by feeding third-instar psyllids on tomato leaves post UV-LASER adjuvant/surfactant treatment, with or without psyllid cdc42- and gelsolin dsRNAs. Gene knockdown was quantified by quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) amplification. At 10 days post the ingestion-access period, knockdown of cdc42 and gelsolin expression was 61% and 56%, respectively, indicating that the dsRNAs delivered to the tomato vasculature were mobile and biologically active. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that UV-LASER adjuvant/surfactant treatments facilitated the delivery of mobile, biologically active dsRNA molecules to the plant vasculature. © 2023 The Authors.

The efficacy of commercial products with two species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, was investigated against adults of the grey maize weevil under laboratory conditions. Nemastar®, containing S. carpocapsae was more effective on T. dilaticollis adults than Nematop® containing H. bacteriophora, when applied uniformly to the surface of the soil, on Petri dishes containing T. dilaticollis adults. Results showed that S. carpocapsae rates of 83–333 infective juveniles/adult caused > 94% mortality in T. dilaticollis adults, whereas H. bacteriophora caused 27–61%, adult mortality, after exposure of insects to the commercial products of EPNs for 15 days. The infection rates of EPNs increased with concentration applied and ranged from 70–83% and 19–64% for Nemastar® and Nematop®, respectively. Subsequent field and semi-field tests were conducted with Nemastar® (application rate of 50 million S. carpocapsae per 100 m2) in maize crops with biological (mycoinsecticide Naturalis®, biofungicides and fertilizers) and chemical seed treatment (Gaucho® FS 600; active ingredient: imidacloprid) in Knezha, Bulgaria. Nematodes were found only in the dead specimens, in open plots and cages sprayed with the commercial nematode product. Nematode sprayings contributed for higher maize yields in the open maize plots in the fields with different seed treatments. We suggest that the use of powder formulation of S. carpocapsae in combination with biologically treated maize seeds can contribute to minimize the use of chemical insecticides against the grey maize weevil. The results obtained can be used as a base to further tests to ascertain the efficacy of EPNs products before they can be recommended for use in the integrated approach to T. dilaticollis management.

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of S-methoprene alone and in combination with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), an adjuvant component of insecticides for synergy, against two strains, Lab-S (susceptible) and Met-R (Methoprene resistant) of an economically important pest species, the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae). Adults of both Lab-S and Met-R strains were exposed to wheat treated with multiple concentrations of S-methoprene ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 and 10 to 60 mg/kg, respectively, alone and in combination with PBO. A variety of concentrations, including 0.27, 0.53, 0.80, and 1.07 g/kg, were evaluated for PBO. Mortality of adults and percent reduction in progeny were assessed after 14 and 65 days of treatment, respectively. As anticipated, the adult mortality rates of both strains were not significantly affected by S-methoprene alone. However, the number of progeny produced confirmed that the Met-R strain exhibited a high level of resistance to S-methoprene alone, with over 50 F1 progeny adults surviving in wheat treated with the maximal rate, 10 mg/kg. In contrast, the toxicity of S-methoprene was increased against the same resistant strain (Met-R), by 0.80 or 1.07 g/kg of PBO in combination treatment, resulting in a significant reduction in progeny numbers (25 adults per container). Although the tested concentrations of S-methoprene and PBO were well above the currently registered rate globally, our results highlight the fact that PBO enhances the toxicity of S-methoprene to some extent, reaffirming that the mode of action of the latter involves the inhibition of mixed-function oxidases (MFOs) and highlights the need for further research into developing potential binary or triplet formulations containing these two active ingredients (AIs). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",NA,237

The results showed that, compared with a suspension concentrate of CF (CF-SC), a solution of CF@MIL-101-SL with the surfactant aerosol OT exhibited excellent wetting, deposition and adhesion with maize leaves. The CF@MIL-101-SL NPs exhibited bidirectional translocation in maize, which significantly enhanced the transport of CF to the target tissues. Field trials revealed that CF@MIL-101-SL maintained > 75 % control efficiency after 21 d of spraying, indicating significantly greater insecticidal activity and persistence than CF-SC. Spray application of CF@MIL-101-SL gave high initial deposition rates, long half-lives on tender and old leaves and significantly reduced pesticide drift into the environment. Based on a biosafety assessment, spraying with CF@MIL-101-SL reduced the negative effects of CF on plants during the growth period.

A major risk factor for infection is the use of contact lenses. Inadequate hygiene precautions and mold-growth permissive storage fluids are important risk factors for fungal keratitis. The aim of this study was to comparatively analyze contact lens storage fluids disinfection efficacy against Fusarium species. Methods: Eleven commercially available storage fluids were tested. The storage fluids were classified according to their active ingredients myristamidopropyldimethylamine (Aldox), polyhexanide and hydrogen peroxide. Efficacy was tested against isolates belonging to the Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum species complexes as the most common agents of mould keratitis. Tests were carried out based on DIN EN ISO 14729. Results: All Aldox and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based fluids were effective against Fusarium spp., while the majority of polyhexanide based storage fluids showed only limited or no antifungal effects. Efficacy of polyhexanide could be restored by the addition of the pH-regulating agent tromethamine - an additive component in one commercially available product. Conclusions: In summary, the use of Aldox- or hydrogen peroxide-based storage fluids may reduce the risk of Fusarium keratitis, while polyhexanide-based agents largely lack efficacy against Fusarium. © 2024 The Authors",NA,242

This study, simultaneous analysis of 39 TSEOn oligomers in citrus orchard soils in China was implemented by the modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) extraction coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The method detection limits (MDLs) and the method quantification limits (MQLs) for TSEOn were 0.003–0.07 μg/kg and 0.01–0.20 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries for TSEOn oligomers in soils ranged from 81 % ∼ 106 % with related standard deviations (RSDs) < 7 %. This newly developed UPLC-MS/MS method with high sensitivity and stability allows us to successfully trace the occurrence of TSEOn congeners in the citrus orchard soils from 3 provinces and 1 municipality in China. The detected concentrations of TSEOn-H oligomers in the sampled soils ranged from 0.02 to 0.288 μg/kg (dry weight). The congener profiles of TSEOn-H were dominated by TSEOn-H (n = 6– 8) in the soils. Additionally, the total concentrations of TSEOn-H congeners (ΣTSEOn-H) in the soils were in the range of 0.03 to 1.49 μg/kg. A comparison of ΣTSEOn-H distribution among the different citrus orchard soils indicated a higher level of ΣTSEOn-H in the soil samples collected from Zhejiang Province. Notably, TSEOn-CH3 or TSEOn-COCH3 oligomers were not detected in the tested soils. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence and distribution of TSEOn congeners in agricultural soils. © 2024",NA,244

With their diverse biological activities, biostimulants can contribute to crop growth, nutrient use efficiency, and abiotic stress resilience, as well as to the restoration of soil health. Biomolecules include humic substances, protein lysates, phenolics, and carbohydrates have undergone thorough investigation because of their demonstrated biostimulant activities. Here, we review the process of the discovery and development of extract-based biostimulants, and propose a practical step-by-step pipeline that starts with initial identification of biomolecules, followed by extraction and isolation, determination of bioactivity, identification of active compound(s), elucidation of mechanisms, formulation, and assessment of effectiveness. The different steps generate a roadmap that aims to expedite the transfer of interdisciplinary knowledge from laboratory-scale studies to pilot-scale production in practical scenarios that are aligned with the prevailing regulatory frameworks. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,245

However, it is difficult to directly identify the acute dermal toxicity of potential compounds through animal experiments alone. In our study, we separately integrated 1735 experimental data based on rabbits and 1679 experimental data based on rats to construct acute dermal toxicity prediction models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The best models for the two animal species achieved AUC values of 78.0 and 82.0%, respectively, on 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, we employed SARpy to extract structural alerts, and in conjunction with Shapley additive explanation and attentive FP heatmap, we identified important features and structural fragments associated with acute dermal toxicity. This approach offers valuable insights for the detection of positive compounds. Moreover, a standalone software tool was developed to make acute dermal toxicity prediction easier.

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al.

Granivorous birds like the Red-legged Partridge (Alectoris rufa) have high exposure risk because they ingest treated seeds that remain on the field surface. As triazole fungicides can act as endocrine disruptors, affecting sterol synthesis and reproduction in birds several months after exposure, we hypothesized that these effects could also impact subsequent generations of exposed birds. To test this hypothesis, we exposed adult partridges (F0) to seeds treated at commercial doses with four different formulations containing triazoles as active ingredients (flutriafol, prothioconazole, tebuconazole, and a mixture of the latter two), simulating field exposure during late autumn sowing. During the subsequent reproductive season, two to four months after exposure, we examined compound allocation of steroid hormones, cholesterol, vitamins, and carotenoids in eggs laid by exposed birds (F1), as well as the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis in one-day-old chicks of this F1. One year later, F1 animals were paired again to investigate the expression of the same genes in the F2 chicks. We found changes in the expression of some genes for all treatments and both generations. Additionally, we observed an increase in estrone levels in eggs from partridges treated with flutriafol compared to controls, a decrease in tocopherol levels in partridges exposed to the mixture of tebuconazole and prothioconazole, and an increase in retinol levels in partridges exposed to prothioconazole. Despite sample size limitations, this study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of action of the previously observed effects of triazole fungicide-treated seeds on avian reproduction with evidence that the effects can persist beyond the exposure windows, affecting unexposed offspring of partridges fed with treated seeds. The results highlight the importance of considering long-term chronic effects when assessing pesticide risks to wild birds. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,248

Using nano-pesticide formulations reduces the amount of pesticide applied, minimizing pest control expenses and environmental contamination. As a result, this study was conducted to develop a microemulsion formulation containing emamectin benzoate or beta-cyfluthrin with improved morphology, droplet size, emulsion stability, and persistence of foam. Moreover to assess the efficacy of the developed microemulsion in comparison to the convention alone against the Egyptian cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) under both laboratory and field conditions. The results showed that the optimum conditions for emamectin benzoate microemulsion was 2% active ingredient, 5% (w/w) ethyl acetate, and DMF (3:2), 3.5% (w/w) Geronol ff4 and Etocas 35 (6:1), 5% (w/w) ethanol, and 86.5% (w/w) water, while for beta-cyfluthrin, a 5.0% active ingredient, 15% (w/w) Solvesso 100 and ethyl acetate (2:1), 7.0% (w/w) Geronol ff4 and Etocas 35 (6:1), 10% (w/w) ethanol, and 68% (w/w) water. Under laboratory conditions, emamectin benzoate was more toxic than beta-cyfluthrin to Spodoptera littoralis second and fourth instar larvae. Emamectin benzoate was more effective that beta-cyfluthrin against Spodoptera littoralis in the field, whether as a microemulsion or a commercial product. Thus, microemulsions of tested insecticides with better formulation qualities may be more effective than traditional ones in controlling cotton leaf worm. © 2024 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",NA,249

Here, we use early stages of zebrafish to evaluate glyphosate as pure active ingredient and within a commercial formulation in terms of oxidative stress. Biomarkers involved in the oxidative status were evaluated along with other markers of neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, energy balance and motor performance, and the selected tools were evaluated by its sensitivity in determining early-warning events. Zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate active ingredient and glyphosate-based formulation were under oxidative stress, but only the commercial formulation delayed the embryogenesis, affected the cholinergic neurotransmission and induced DNA damage. Both altered the motor performance of larvae at very low concentrations, becoming larvae hypoactive. The energy balance was also impaired, as embryos under oxidative stress had lower lipids reserves. Although data suggest that glyphosate-based formulation has higher toxicity than the active ingredient itself, the most sensitive biomarkers detected early-warning effects at very low concentrations of the active ingredient. Biochemical biomarkers of defense system and oxidative damage were the most sensitive tools, detecting pro-oxidant responses at very low concentrations, along with markers of motor performance that showed high sensitivity and high throughput, suitable for detecting early effects linked to neurotoxicity. Alterations on morphology during embryogenesis showed the lowest sensitivity, thus morphological alterations appeared after several alterations at biochemical levels. Tools evaluating DNA damage and cell proliferation showed mid-sensitivity, but low throughput, thus they could be used as complementary markers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,250

Recent years have seen a surge in tick-borne diseases (TBD) resulting in a high demand for tick management products. Plants offer a valuable source of active compounds for the development of novel, eco-friendly tick control products, reducing potential risks to human and animal health. Essential oils (EOs) have emerged as potential acaricides and repellents against ticks providing an alternative to synthetic chemicals and aiding in the prevention of TBD by lowering the risk of tick bites. We investigated the acaricidal activity of EOs from lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), geranium (Pelargonium x asperum), savory thyme (Thymus saturejoides), and white thyme (Thymus zygis) on I. scapularis. The interactions (i.e., synergistic, antagonistic, or additive) of their binary mixtures were also evaluated. EO samples were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine their chemical composition. The adult immersion test was used to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) of each EO alone and in mixtures. Quantitative assessment of synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of the binary mixtures was performed by calculating the combination index. Strong acaricidal activity was recorded for savory thyme and white thyme EOs, with LC50 values of 28.0 and 11.0 μg/μL, respectively. The LC50 of lemongrass and geranium EOs were 49.0 and 39.7 μg/μL, respectively. Among the tested EOs, savory thyme and white thyme had a strong acaricidal effect on I. scapularis, which might be linked to the presence of carvacrol (26.05 % ± 0.38) and thymol (53.6 % ± 2.31), main components present in savory thyme and white thyme EOs, respectively. The tick killing efficacy of lemongrass and geranium EOs was lower when mixed than when used separately (LC50 of 65.3 µg/µL). The same happened with savory thyme and white thyme EOs, except at 9.75 µg/µL where they had a synergistic effect (LC50 of 58.3 µg/µL). Lemongrass and savory thyme EOs had a synergistic effect at low concentrations, and an antagonistic effect at higher concentrations (LC50 of 95.4 µg/µL). Lemongrass and white thyme EOs had a synergistic effect against ticks from 15 to 120 µg/µL (LC50 of 18.5 µg/µL) similar to white thyme EO. Geranium and savory thyme EOs had an antagonistic effect at all concentrations, with an LC50 of 66.8 µg/µL. Geranium and white thyme EOs also had an antagonistic effect, except at 12.7 µg/µL where they had a synergistic effect (LC50 of 66.8 µg/µL). The interaction observed when combining selected essential oils suggests promising potential for developing acaricidal formulations aimed at controlling ticks and curbing the transmission of tick-borne disease agents. © 2024 The Authors",NA,251

However, although many studies have demonstrated the toxic and repellent effect of EOs against harmful insects, some studies indicate that EOs can act, on the contrary, as attractants for harmful insects. In the practical use of EOs as active ingredients in insecticidal/repellent formulations, these contrasting effects may generate unexpected responses from insects. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that EOs may act in a hormesis biphasic concentration-response effect characterized by a low-concentration stimulation (attraction) and a high-concentration inhibition (repulsion) of the insect chemotaxis. For this purpose, the EOs obtained from twelve aromatic plant species belonging to eight botanical families were chemically characterized and tested for their toxicity (by fumigation) and attractiveness or repellence (by two-choice olfactometer bioassays) against the stored cereals pest Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). EO compositions were variable both qualitatively and quantitatively: while phenylpropanoids were the most represented chemical class in the EOs of Cinnamomum verum, Myristica fragrans, Ocimum basilicum, Piper aduncum, and Syzygium aromaticum, monoterpene hydrocarbons dominated the Citrus aurantium and Citrus reticulata EOs compositions, and they represented over 60% of the Schinus molle EO; the Clinopodium nubigenum and Clinopodium tomentosum EOs, as well as the Elettaria cardamomum EO, were mainly rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, while Piper nigrum was the only species among those studied whose EO composition was mainly represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Toxicity tests showed a wide range of activity among the tested EOs, with LC50 values ranging from 2.19 to 218.32 µL L−1 for C. nubigenum and C. verum EOs, respectively. Behavioral tests showed that C. aurantium, C. nubigenum, C. tomentosum, and O. basilicum EOs exerted an overall repellent effect, which was significant at concentrations ranging from 1.19 to 23.87 µL EO L−1 air. Conversely, C. verum and S. aromaticum EOs were predominantly attractive, with a significant attractiveness in the range of concentrations from 2.39 to 11.94 and at 23.87 µL EO L−1 air, respectively. However, half of the tested EOs (C. reticulata, E. cardamomum, M. fragrans, P. aduncum, P. nigrum, and S. molle) showed both negative and positive chemotaxis depending on the EO concentration. Overall, the results indicated that EOs can exert attractive and repellent activity depending on their chemical composition and concentration. Since EOs contain volatile substances whose concentration varies over time after the application, the implication of these results will be discussed in relation to their possible use as insect repellents for active packaging or as attractive lures for trapping. © 2024 The Authors",NA,252

This assay has recently gained interest because of its ease of studying the interactions of xenobiotics with different organisms. Chrysoperla externa (Hagen, 1861) is a species of great economic relevance because it is a predator of major agricultural pests during its larval stage. Neonicotinoids are the most important chemical class of insecticides introduced into markets. A previous imidacloprid toxicity assessment on C. externa showed that this neonicotinoid insecticide reduced the egg viability. The objective of this study was to analyze the genotoxicity of Confidor OD® (imidacloprid 20% a.i., LS, Bayer CropScience) on the biological control agent C. externa at DNA level using the comet assay as an ecotoxicological biomarker. A comet assay protocol has been developed for this species at first time. For the bioassays, the commercial product formulated Confidor OD® was used at two concentrations: 100 and 180 mg/l of the active ingredient. Selected eggs were dipped in a Confidor OD® solution for 15 s. Descriptors evaluated in the comet assay were damage index, % DNA damage, and tail length. The damage index did not show any significant differences between the different concentrations evaluated, but differences were observed for tail length, because at higher concentrations of Confidor OD®, there were greater DNA breaks. The DNA of the cells from treated eggs analyzed at 48 h and 96 h of development showed the same % DNA damage; that is, they had no recovery capacity. Application of Confidor OD® to C. externa eggs produced irreparable breaks at the DNA level. The technique adjusted for C. externa can be used in other beneficial insects to study pesticide genotoxicity using a comet assay. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,253

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world's most used pesticides, but until recent years they have been claimed to be safe for non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Using controlled arena experiments, we investigated the effects on the learning and long-term memory of buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), of a single field-realistic dose of glyphosate, both in its pure form and as a commercial herbicide (Roundup Gold) containing the active ingredient (a.i.) glyphosate and other co-formulants. We found that glyphosate in its pure form caused deterioration in the learning ability of bumblebees in a 10-color discrimination experiment; the glyphosate-treated bees discriminated colors over 10% worse than the untreated control bees. However, the commercially used GBH (Roundup Gold) had no observable effect on the learning ability of the bumblebees, despite the fact that this herbicide contained the same amount of glyphosate as its pure form. These findings shed light on the potential risks associated with agrochemicals previously considered safe for pollinators and emphasize the need for comprehensive risk assessments of pesticides, including evaluations of cognitive functions in pollinators. Therefore, we propose that future pesticide testing should incorporate broader assessments to ensure the safety of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. © 2024 The Authors.

Various approaches to weed management are commonly practiced by crop growers. Due to limitations in other control methods, farmers often choose herbicides as a cost-effective, rapid and highly efficient weed control strategy. Although herbicides are highly effective on most weeds, they are not a complete solution for weed management because of the genetic diversity and evolving flexibility of weed communities. The excessive and indiscriminate use of herbicides and their dominance in weed control have triggered the rapid generation of herbicide-resistant weed species. Moreover, environmental losses of active ingredients in the herbicides cause serious damage to the environment and pose a serious threat to living organisms. Scientific advances have enabled nanotechnology to emerge as an innovation with real potential in modern agriculture, adding a new dimension in the preparation of controlled release formulations (CRF) of herbicides. Here the required amount of active ingredients is released over longer periods of time to obtain the desired biological efficacy whilst reducing the harmful effects of these chemicals. Various organic and inorganic carrier materials have been utilised in CRF and researchers have a wide range of options for the synthesis of eco-friendly carrier materials, especially those with less or no toxicity to living organisms. This manuscript addresses the history, progress, and consequences of herbicide application, and discusses potential ways to reduce eco-toxicity due to herbicide application, along with directions for future research areas using the benefits of nanotechnology. © 2024 The Authors",NA,255

This study investigated the impact of a commercial non-ionic surfactant product containing alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEOs) on the persistence of thiabendazole on apple and spinach surfaces against the 30 kg m−3 baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) soaking, which was used to remove the active ingredient (AI) in the cuticular wax layer of fresh produce through alkaline hydrolysis. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) mapping method was used to quantify the residue levels on fresh produce surfaces at different experimental scenarios. Four standard curves were established to quantify surface thiabendazole in the absence and presence of APEOs, on apple and spinach leaf surfaces, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, the result showed that APEOs enhanced the persistence of thiabendazole over time. After 3 days of exposure, APEOs increased thiabendazole surface residue against NaHCO3 hydrolysis on apple and spinach surfaces by 5.39% and 10.47%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that APEOs led to more pesticide residues on fresh produce and greater difficulty in washing them off from the surfaces using baking soda, posing food safety concerns. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,256

To mitigate the invasion of indoor insect pests, behavioral modifications using spatial repellents containing natural products are emerging as alternatives to chemical insecticides especially around the kitchens and food storage areas. However, the absence of standardized testing methods for spatial repellency has undermined the reliability of these products. We introduced three distinct laboratory-scale repellency assays and their relevancy to simulated-use conditions. Out of eleven commercial products tested, five showed effectiveness in laboratory assays, and three of these were further proven effective in simulated-use tests as well. Another issue limiting the utility of commercially available spatial repellents was the lack of clear and comprehensive use instructions on product labels, potentially leading to ineffective applications. We observed that increasing the applied quantity improved the efficacy of one product that was initially determined to be ineffective in a simulated-use test. Based on our findings, we propose three strategies for regulations of spatial repellents: 1) consideration of mixture effects beyond single active ingredients especially using the natural products as their active ingredients, 2) the use of multiple testing systems, while acknowledging the limitations of laboratory assays in predicting real-world efficacy, and 3) ensuring product labels provide detailed and clear instructions for effective use. © 2024 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",NA,257

Despite their advantages in crop production and disease management, the use of pesticides poses significant hazards to the environment and public health. Pesticide elements have now perpetually entered our atmosphere and subsequently contaminated water, food, and soil, leading to health threats ranging from acute to chronic toxicities. Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The toxicity of a pesticide formulation may depend on the specific active ingredient and the presence of synergistic or inert compounds that can enhance or modify its toxicity. Safety concerns are the need of the hour to control contemporary pesticide-induced health hazards. The effectiveness and implementation of the current legislature in providing ample protection for human health and the environment are key concerns.

Treatment with this formulation of B. subtilis significantly reduced the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) by up to 52% compared to untreated control plants in greenhouse tests. Comparisons between applying the biocontrol weekly after seeding for 5 weeks versus a single application at transplanting (5 weeks) indicated no significant benefits of additional applications. The formulation of B. subtilis reduced disease caused by a mefenoxam-resistant isolate of P. capsici, while mefenoxam failed. The biocontrol efficacy of formulated strains was not affected in different soil types or potting media. However, disease was more severe in sandy soils. In field experiments that were conducted with a mefenoxam-sensitive isolate, disease incidence and severity of Phytophthora blight were significantly reduced at all rates of B. subtilis in 2019 except the 16.8 kg ha−1 rate. In both years, mefenoxam was more effective than B. subtilis in controlling disease in the field. B. subtilis did not affect the spatial dynamics of pathogen spread within rows. While the precise mechanism(s) of action is unclear, in vitro dual-culture tests suggest direct antagonism, as B. subtilis significantly inhibited colony growth of P. capsici. AgBiome has recently released a new formulation of the AFS032321 strain named Theia, with higher active ingredients for commercial applications and biocontrol of P. capsici. © 2024 The American Phytopathological Society.",NA,260

Most deaths result from self-poisoning by ingestion, rather than occupational or accidental exposures, which are typically topical or inhalational. Severe pesticide poisoning is more common in rural lower- and middle-income countries where pesticides are widely used in smallholder agricultural practice and therefore freely available. Significant acute poisoning is much less common in industrialized countries; here the long-term effects of low-dose chronic exposure most concern the population. Poisoning from organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides causes most severe cases and deaths worldwide, although numbers are falling as the most highly toxic compounds are withdrawn from agricultural practice. Severe organophosphorus poisoning requires urgent resuscitation and administration of oxygen, atropine and oximes. Paraquat and aluminium phosphide are major problems in some countries, with case fatality usually >50% and no effective treatments. Newer pesticides that have become widely used over the last 30 years, for example neonicotinoid and phenylpyrazole insecticides, are more selective in their toxicity to pests, resulting in far less acute human toxicity and few deaths. Toxicity can result from solvents rather than the pesticide's active ingredient. Acute poisoning with newer pesticides usually requires only careful supportive care. © 2024",NA,261

To evaluate the adverse effects caused in adults of Danio rerio species exposed to the pesticides abamectin, difenoconazole, and their commercial formulations (Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC®), both isolated and in mixtures, biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in the gills of organisms exposed to sublethal concentrations. To this end, the activities of the enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), lipid hydroperoxide (LH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were measured after 48 h of exposure to the different pesticide treatments. The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations. It is concluded that the commercial formulations Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC® and their mixtures cause significant alterations in the detoxification metabolism of exposed organisms and induce oxidative stress in fish. © 2024",NA,262

The biting midge Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is an important pest of livestock in much of the United States and larval midges utilize semi-aquatic habitats which are permissive for Bti product application. Reports suggest that Bti products are ineffective at killing biting midges despite their taxonomic relation to black flies and mosquitoes. Here, we investigate the toxicity of a Bti-based commercial insecticide and its active ingredient in larval Culicoides sonorensis. A suspected mechanism of Bti tolerance is an acidic larval gut, and we used a pH indicator dye to examine larval Culicoides sonorensis gut pH after exposure to Bti. RESULTS: The lethal concentration to kill 90% (LC90) of larvae of the commercial product (386 mg/L) was determined to be almost 10 000 times more than that of some mosquito species, and no concentration of active ingredient tested achieved 50% larval mortality. The larval gut was found to be more acidic after exposure to Bti which inhibits Bti toxin activity. By comparison, 100% mortality was achieved in larval Aedes aegypti at the product's label rate for this species and mosquito larvae had alkaline guts regardless of treatment. Altering the larval rearing water to alkaline conditions enhanced Bti efficacy when using the active ingredient. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Bti is not practical for larval Culicoides sonorensis control at the same rates as mosquitos but show that alterations or additives to the environment could make the products more effective. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,263

However, the key influencing factors for bioactivity enhancement of nanopesticides remain unclear, which not only limits the exploration of relevant mechanisms, but also hinders the precise design and development of nanopesticides. In this study, we explored the potential of SND in enhancing the bioactivity of nanopesticides, specifically focusing on abamectin SND prepared using a self-emulsifying-carrier solidifying technique combined with parameter optimization. Our formulation, consisting of 8% abamectin, 1% antioxidant BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol), 12% complex surfactants, and 79% sodium benzoate, significantly increased the pseudo-solubility of abamectin by at least 3300 times and reduced its particle size to a mere 15 nm, much smaller than traditional emulsion in water (EW) and water-dispersible granule (WDG) forms. This reduction in particle size and increase in surface activity resulted in improved foliar adhesion and retention, enabling a more efficient application without the need for organic solvents. The inclusion of antioxidants also enhanced photostability compared to EW, and overall stability tests confirmed SND's resilience under various storage conditions. Bioactivity tests demonstrated a marked increase in toxicity against diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella L.) with abamectin SND, which exhibited 3.7 and 7.6 times greater efficacy compared to EW and WDG, respectively. These findings underscore the critical role of small particle size, high surface activity, and strong antioxidant properties in improving the performance and bioactivity of abamectin SND, highlighting its significance in the design and development of high-efficiency, eco-friendly nanopesticides and contributing valuably to sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,264

Microbial spoilage and other factors such as physiological disorder, mechanical and physical damage, and fruit senescence are the major factors of postharvest loss to citrus industry. The postharvest losses in citrus are directly have negative impcats on the economy, environment and healths due to production of carbon emission gases. The fungal pathogens such as Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum and Geotrichum candidum are the major cause of postharvest spoilage in citrus fruits. These pathogens produce different mycotoxins such as citrinin, patulin, and tremorgenic. These mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of molds; they employ toxic effects on the healths. The acuteness of mytoxin on toxicity is dependings on the extent exposure, age and nutritional status of individual. The toxicity of mytoxins are directly related to the food safety and health concern including damage DNA, kidney damage, mutation in RNA/DNA, growth impairment in childs and immune system etc. Several attempts have been made to extend the shelf-life of citrus fruits by controlling physiological decay and fungal growth which has got limited success. In recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as a new strategy for shelf life prevention of citrus fruits. The biopolymer based nano-formulations functionalized with active compounds have shown promising results in maintaining the postharvest quality attributes of fruits and vegetables by retarding the moisture loss and oxidation. This review exclusively discloses the postharvest losses in citrus fruits and their causes. In addition, the use of biopolymer based nanoformulations functionalized with active agents and their developing technologies have been also discussed briefly. The effects of nano-formulation technologies on the postharvest shelf life of citrus is also described.The finding of this review also suggest that the natural biopolymers and bioactive compounds can be used for developing nanoformulations for extending the shelf-life of citrus fruits by minimizing the fungal growth and as an alternatives of fungicides. © The Author(s) 2023.",NA,265

This mode of action (MoA) is an important chemical control option for T. picirostris management. To evaluate insecticide resistance selection to pyrethroids (bifenthrin) and other MoAs labeled for T. picirostris management (malathion and chlorantraniliprole), adult populations were collected from 8 commercial white clover grown for seed fields in the Willamette Valley, OR, in 2022 and 2023. Among collected Oregon populations, very high resistance ratios (RR50=178.00-725.67) were observed to technical grade bifenthrin and low to high resistance ratios (RR50=7.80-32.80) to malathion in surface contact assays compared to a susceptible Canadian field population.

ANESPSAT activity was compared with spilanthol and derivatives (ANESPE and others). The compound was synthesized in a gram-scale by a 2-step process, comprising a direct ester amidation and a Horner-Wadsworth- Emmons reaction. The nanoemulsions were produced by coarse homogenization followed by high-energy ultrasonication, in which hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential remained stable. The spilanthol-eugenol hybrid derivatives did not show significant acaricidal activity. ANESPE killed 83% of the R. microplus larvae at 30 mg.mL−1, while ANESPSAT killed 97% at 0.5 mg.mL−1, showing to be the most active compound. Spilanthol and ANESPSAT had similar high mortality rates for tick larvae, with LC50 values of 0.10 and 0.14 mg.mL−1 for R. microplus larvae, and 0.04 and 0.48 mg.mL−1 for A. sculptum larvae, respectively. The efficacy of spilanthol was lower against R. microplus engorged females when compared with ANESPSAT, which was highly effective (>98%) against R. microplus engorged females. The nanoemulsion with ANESPSAT was effective against tick females, preventing egg laying and achieving 100% efficacy at 2.5 mg.mL−1. Spilanthol had only 59% efficacy at 10 mg.mL−1.

Though the application of mixtures containing several products is a common practice, interactions between microbial biopesticides and related effects on bees as non-target organisms have not been studied yet. In the current study, we exposed winter bees to five different microbial-based products and their combinations at the maximum recommended application rate to assess their responses. Laboratory oral exposure tests (acute/chronic) to single or binary products were conducted. Survival and food consumption of the tested bees were evaluated over the experimental duration. Our results show that some product combinations have potential additive or synergistic effects on bees, whereas others did not affect the bee’s survival compared to the control. Exposure of tested bees to the most critical combination of products containing Bacillus thuringiensis aizawai ABTS-1857 and B. amyloliquefaciens QST 713 strongly resulted in a median lifespan of 4.5 days compared to 8.0 and 8.5 days after exposure to the solo products, respectively. The exposure to inactivated microorganisms by autoclaving them did not differ from their respective uncontaminated negative controls, indicating effects on bee mortality might originate in the treatment with the different microorganisms or their metabolites.

Our aim was to estimate 48 h-LC50 and sub-chronic effects after the exposure to low concentrations of chlorpyrifos as commercial formulation (CF) and active ingredient (AI) on B. straminea adult, embryos and juveniles. Concentrations between 1 and 5000 μg L−1 were chosen for acute exposures and 0.1 and 1 μg L−1 for the sub-chronic one. After 14 days biochemical parameters, viability and sub-populations of hemocytes, reproductive parameters, embryotoxicity and offspring' survival were studied. Egg masses laid between day 12 and 14 were separated to continue the exposure and the embryos were examined daily. Offspring' survival and morphological changes were registered for 14 days after hatching. 48 h-LC50, NOEC and LOEC were similar between CF and AI, however the CF caused more sub-lethal effects. CF but not the AI decreased carboxylesterases, catalase and the proportion of hyalinocytes with respect to the total hemocytes, and increased superoxide dismutase and the % of granulocytes with pseudopods. Also CF caused embryotoxicity probably due to the increase of embryos' membrane permeability. Acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, hemocytes sub-populations, the time and rate of hatching and juveniles' survival were the most sensitive biomarkers. We emphasize the importance of the assessment of a battery of biomarkers as a useful tool for toxicity studies including reproduction parameters and immunological responses.

Nonetheless, the over-application of synthetic formulations can generate other problems, like phytotoxicity, or the pollution of water and soil. In this context, botanical extracts with antifungal properties can represent an environmentally friendly alternative to control fungal infections. The application of natural products in the form of crude extracts still requires the incorporation of toxic organic solvents to be used as vehicle. Nanotechnology allows the dispersion of hydroalcoholic extracts in water simply by the nanoencapsulation of the active molecules in a biodegradable polymer, with the advantage that no organic solvents are required while, at the same time, this polymer may protect the extract against photodegradation. The present study aims to encapsulate an antifungal Piper schlechtendalii crude extract in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid nanospheres, conferring good dispersion in water while protecting the active ingredients against degradation by solar irradiation. The particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency obtained were 170 nm,-37 mV, and 33.7 %, respectively.

Although co-formulants in pesticide formulations were considered inactive components from the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pesticide, several studies have proven the high individual toxicity of formulating agents, as well as the enhanced combined toxicity of the active ingredients and other components. Since the majority of active ingredients are present in the form of chemical mixtures in our environment, the possible combined toxicity between active ingredients and co-formulants is particularly important. To assess the individual and combined phytotoxicity of the components, glyphosate was tested in the form of pure active ingredient (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and herbicide formulations (Roundup Classic and Medallon Premium) formulated with a mixture of polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEA) or alkyl polyglucosides (APG), respectively. The order of acute toxicity was as follows for Roundup Classic: glyphosate < herbicide formulation < POEA. However, the following order was demonstrated for Medallon Premium: herbicide formulation < glyphosate < APG. Increased photosynthetic activity was detected after the exposure to the formulation (1.5–5.8 mg glyphosate/L and 0.5–2.2 mg POEA/L) and its components individually (glyphosate: 13–27.2 mg/L, POEA: 0.6–4.8 mg/L), which indicates hormetic effects. However, decreased photosynthetic activity was detected at higher concentrations of POEA (19.2 mg/L) and Roundup Classic (11.6–50.6 mg glyphosate/L). Differences were demonstrated in the sensitivity of the selected algae species and, in addition to the individual and combined toxicity of the components presented in the glyphosate-based herbicides.

During mating, this interference may alter the criteria deployed to assess potential mates as males and females find they must shift their focus and emphasize alternative sensory modalities. The wolf spider, Tigrosa helluo (Araneae, Lycosidae) is common in agricultural fields where commercial formulations of herbicides with glyphosate as the active ingredient are regularly applied. With the development of genetically resistant crops, glyphosate-based herbicides have become among the most widely used and heavily applied agricultural chemicals in the world. In a laboratory experiment, we explored the effects of this herbicide on male—female interactions during courtship, mating, and sexual cannibalism. We expected that it might impact assessment such that there was a shift in the features that were important to the outcome of mating interactions. When herbicide was present, female body condition, an indication of recent feeding success, became important to mating success. This result was, in part, due to higher rates of sexual cannibalism in parings of males and females with low body condition values. The leg raises and pedipalp waves that males perform in courtship were not affected by herbicide nor were they related to mating success but, across all treatments, they were negatively correlated with lytic activity of females as measured just prior to pairing. This result indicates that males detected this aspect of the female's physiology and that a strong immune response made the female less attractive, possibly because it indicated a current or recent infection. Taken together, these results verify that a common herbicide shifts mating criteria used by an agribiont spider and, separate from the herbicide, the immune status of females affects the reactions of courting males. © 2024 The Author(s).

While the innate metal binding and reducing ability of collagenous scales aided self-synthesis cum grafting of Cu2O, the selective binding potential of Cu2O to Gly facilitated its hand-retrieval; as assessed using optical characterizations, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Optimization studies revealed extractions of diverse pay-loads of Gly between 0.1 μg/mL to 40 μg/mL per 80 mg biotemplate grafted with ~6.354 μg of sub-5 nm Cu2O and was exponential to the number of Cu2O@biotemplates. Even though pH and surfactant didn't have any impact on the adsorption of Gly to the Cu2O@biotemplates, increase in the ionic strength led to a drastic increase in the adsorption. Density function theory simulations unveiled the involvement of phosphonic and carboxylic groups of Gly for interaction with Cu2O with a bond length of 1.826 Å and 1.833 Å, respectively.

(also known as Spanish jasmine) leaf extracts, providing valuable insights into its potential benefits. Our study performed a crude methanol (ME) extraction of Spanish jasmine leaves with acid-base solvent partitioning, resulting in an acidic fraction (AE), a neutral fraction (NE), and an aqueous fraction (AQ). The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the TPC of the extracts. The AE fraction displayed the highest TPC (79.8±0.61 mgGAE/g dry weight), followed by the NE and AQ fractions. The extracts were further evaluated for their antioxidant activity using the DPPH assay. The AE fraction had the highest antioxidant activity with an EC50 value of 4.6±0.40 µg/mL. The main active compound, oleuropein, was isolated and determined using spectral data. The isolated compound displayed excellent antioxidant activity with an EC50 value of 13.0±0.06 µg/mL. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of the Spanish jasmine leaf extracts was calculated using the disc diffusion method based on the minimum inhibitory concentration. The AE fraction exhibited activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, with a MIC value of 0.78 µg/mL. The AE fraction also displayed the highest degree of activity against Staphylococcus strains, including drug-resistant strains (MRSA and VRSA), with a MIC range of 0.39-12.5 µg/mL. It is important to highlight that the AE fraction demonstrated the highest level of activity against all VRSA strains tested despite their resistance to vancomycin and oxacillin. These findings strongly indicate that Spanish jasmine leaves possess potent natural antioxidant and antibacterial properties, positioning them as a highly promising plant source. © 2024, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

To remediate the soil contaminated with these pollutants, various methods have been proposed including coupled soil washing with Fenton or Sono-Fenton process. In this study, non-ionic surfactants [Tween 85 AND linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LASs)] were used for the removal of chlorpyrifos (organophosphate pesticide). The optimal conditions for LAS surfactant were found to be a concentration of 2.5 g/L with 20/1.5 ratio (liquid/solid), 360 min operation time and 120 rpm washing speed in room temperature; while 1 g/L Tween 85 concentration was more effective at 20:1 ratio (liquid solid), 360 min operation time and 60 rpm washing speed in room temperature, respectively. The results imply that combining both Tween 85 and LAS can be an effective way to remove large amounts of contaminants from soils quickly without damaging them further or harming humans who might come into contact with it afterward. The results of the experimental study on soil washing and Fenton/Sono-Fenton suggest that these two processes combined can be an effective way to remediate soils contaminated with chlorpyrifos. This combination was shown to provide superior results for both remediation and recovery of surfactants used in the cleaning process. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2023.",NA,277

The microspheres were encapsulated using polyethylene glycol and 1-hexadecanol to form a sustained-release SP tablet. Micromorphology, active ingredient loading, structure identification, photolysis resistance and biological activity were evaluated in this report. RESULTS: (i) The SP microspheres had an average particle size of 6.16 ± 2.28 μm, low adhesion and good dispersion as evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and morphology. (ii) The average active ingredient loading and encapsulation of SP microspheres were 32.80 ± 0.74% and 78.41 ± 2.22%, respectively. (iii) The chemical structure of encapsulated SP was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. (iv) The photostability of the microspheres and the tablets were evaluated. The results showed that DT50 (time required to dissipate 50% of the mass originally present) of SP was 0.95 days in microspheres and 6.94 days in tablets. (v) The long-term insecticidal activity of SP tablets was investigated, and the tablet had a long-lasting activity against the mosquito larvae, showing 100% larval mortality for 63 days.

In Africa, total use of pesticides was 65,943 tons in 1999 and increased to 107,864 tons in 2019. Insecticide use in Africa is greater than relative changes globally (+29% in Africa vs. +20% globally). . However, the total use of pesticides in Egypt's agricultural sector was 13,214 tons in 1999 and decreased to 13,178 tons in 2019. After application, there are gradually a lot of containers and pesticide waste. There are various types of pesticide waste: empty containers, surplus pesticide solution mixtures, surplus pesticide products, active ingredients, expired raw materials, ready-to-use formulations, rinse water from containers, application equipment, spill clean-up materials and obsolete pesticides. All developed and developing countries face the problem of pesticide waste; however, the problem is different in developed industrialized countries and in poor developing countries. The share of pesticide packaging collected in 2005 was 17.3% worldwide. Therefore, in 2019, CMPT will offer 56 container management programs worldwide. On the other hand, the innovative treatment technologies for the disposal of pesticide waste include various processes, i.e. H. chemical dechlorination, photocatalytic oxidation, thermal desorption, biodegradation, solidification and stabilization technologies. There are many difficulties with meter development, including a lack of national regulations, laws and awareness of pesticide waste and container disposal. In addition, there is insufficient control and regulation of pesticide imports, the lack of good storage facilities, and political and social problems that impede the development process. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)",NA,279

A substantial burden has been forced on agriculture, especially by the injudicious use of chemical herbicides, resulting in extensive environmental contamination. It is essential to have environmentally safe and cost-effective solutions with reduced use of chemical herbicides to improve productivity and sustainability in agriculture. Bioherbicides ought to possess active ingredients derived from living organisms, e.g., fungi, bacteria, and viruses, including the natural byproducts during their growth, or plant-derived products with phytotoxic properties along with ancillary compounds (e.g., surfactants, adjuvants, preserving agents, water retaining additives, inert fillers, and more) applied for eco-friendly weed control in cropping and non-cropping zones. Therefore, the importance of bioherbicide usage in sustainable agriculture cannot be overemphasized. This chapter provides insight into the concept and categories of bioherbicides, the history of the development of bioherbicides, methods of bioherbicide production, formulation of bioherbicides and their application, mode of actions of bioherbicides, factors affecting their efficacy, and the limitations of bioherbicides development and application for sustainable weed management. © The Author(s).

Kol B3 influences the growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium sambucinum IM 6525. The results showed a noticeable increase in antifungal effectiveness when biotic and abiotic agents were combined. This effect manifested across diverse parameters, including fungal growth inhibition, changes in hyphae morphology, fungal membrane permeability and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In response to the presence of Fusarium and AZ in the culture, the bacteria changed the proportions of biosurfactants (surfactin and iturin) produced. The presence of both AZ and/or Fusarium resulted in an increase in iturin biosynthesis. Only in 72 h old bacterial-fungal co-culture a 20% removal of AZ was noted. In the fungal cultures (with and without the addition of the bacteria), the presence of an AZ metabolite named azoxystrobin free acid was detected in the 48th and 72nd hours of the process. The possible involvement of increased iturin and ROS content in antifungal activity of Bacillus sp. and AZ when used together are also discussed.

In this search for botanical insecticides for controlling S. frugiperda, the following were evaluated: (i) the toxicity of essential oils (EOs) from Cinnamodendron dinisii, Eugenia uniflora, and Melaleuca armillaris; (ii) the effect of EOs on life table parameters against S. frugiperda; (iii) the chemical characterization of EOs; and (iv) the in silico interaction of the chemical constituents present in the three EOs with the molecular targets of S. frugiperda. The EO from E. uniflora had the lowest LD50 (1.19 µg of EO/caterpillar). The major compounds bicyclogermacrene (18.64%) in C. dinisii and terpinolene (57.75%) in M. armillaris are highly predicted to interact with the octopamine receptor (OctpR). The compound 1,8-cineole (21.81%) in M. armillaris interacts mainly with a tolerant methoprene receptor (MET) and curzerene (41.22%) in E. uniflora, which acts on the OctpR receptor. Minor compounds, such as nerolidol in C. dinisii and β-elemene in E. uniflora, are highly ranked for multiple targets: AChE, MET, OctpR, and 5-HT1.

In addition to V504, resorcinol was used as a carbon source, and terephthalaldehyde as a cross-linking agent. Three materials were produced with different proportions of resorcinol: V504, 1:1 (R1V), 1:2 (R2V), and 1:3 (R3V). V504 enabled the production of large mesoporous carbon, mainly for the materials with higher proportions of surfactant. The average pore diameters of the materials varied between 5 and 29 nm, and the mesopore volumes were on the order of 0.922 cm3 g−1. The three produced materials were applied to remove emerging contaminants (EC) with different structural dimensions: paracetamol (PA), atrazine (AT), tenofovir (TF), and ceftriaxone (CF). During the contact test, R2V and R3V showed removals above 90 % for all EC. However, due to its limited mesoporosity, the R1V material had its removal capacity reduced for contaminants of larger structural dimensions. Through kinetic and isotherm studies for systems involving paracetamol and ceftriaxone, it was proven that, in fact, not only the specific surface area but also the pore size and pore volume influence adsorption. As a result of this study, large mesoporous carbon could be produced using a surfactant that has not previously been investigated for the solvent-free method. Furthermore, the materials produced can be used as effective adsorbents for emerging contaminants of various structural dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,283

These methods may not be feasible and environmentally safe because of their high operational costs, energy requirements, and cause of secondary pollution. Bioremediation is a promising approach, but it is also a time-consuming process. Alternatively, the Bioelectrochemical system (BES) is an innovative technology for remediating diverse types of recalcitrant pollutants. However, there still exist some bottlenecks to BES for field-scale applications i.e., low mass transfer, poor electrical activity of anodes as electron acceptors, low bioavailability of organic matter, and limited beneficial bacterial activity. To overcome these challenges, various types of synthetic and natural surfactants have been investigated, though only biological surfactants like rhamnolipids were considered as possible interventions in terms of environmental safety. Therefore, this review of literature provides a brief overview of challenges associated with polluted soil remediation and describes currently available technologies including physico-chemical, biological and other available options. Subsequently, the advances of BES and their application for various types of pollutants remediation including petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), azo dyes, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were comprehensively discussed. Further, the potential of rhamnolipid-assisted BES, its challenges and prospects to enhance bioremediation of soil pollutants were addressed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,284

It readily colonizes the skin, nares, respiratory and urinary tract of hospitalized patients, and such colonization may lead to invasive Candida infection in susceptible patients. However, there is no recommended decolonization protocol for C. auris by international health authorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility of C. auris to commonly used synthetic and natural antiseptic products using an in vitro, broth microdilution assay. Synthetic antiseptics including chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, and nystatin were shown to be fungicidal against C. auris. Among the natural antiseptics tested, tea tree oil and manuka oil were both fungicidal against C. auris at concentrations less than or equal to 1.25% (v/v). Manuka honey inhibited C. auris at 25% (v/v) concentrations. Among the commercial products tested, manuka body wash and mouthwash were fungicidal against C. auris at concentrations less than or equal to 0.39% (w/v) and 6.25% (v/v) of products as supplied for use, respectively, while tea tree body wash and MedihoneyTM wound gel demonstrated fungistatic properties. In conclusion, this study demonstrated good in vitro antifungal efficacy of tea tree oil, manuka oil, manuka honey, and commercially available antiseptic products containing these active ingredients.

The synthesis of CeO2-ZnO nanocomposites employs both co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, with the inclusion of the zwitterionic surfactant (SB-12) as a surface modifier. The modulation of pH levels during the synthesis of CeO2-ZnO nanocomposites allows for the optimization of crucial reaction parameters. Notably, it is observed that nanocomposites prepared at pH 9 exhibit the smallest average particle size. To comprehensively characterize these prepared nanocomposites, various analytical techniques such as FTIR, XRD, DR-UV/Vis, TEM/EDS, and Nano particle size analysis are employed. The FTIR results reveal a reduced presence of impurities at higher pH levels. Notably, the CeO2-ZnO nanocomposites synthesized via the hydrothermal method at pH 9 exhibit polyhedral nanostructures. The research's significant contribution lies in the practical application of these nanocomposites for the degradation of highly toxic and persistent organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, particularly Endosulfan and Dimethoate. These nanoparticles demonstrate remarkable pesticide degradation capabilities, with a particular emphasis on their high effectiveness against Endosulfan.

NYG5-emitted VOCs also inhibited the growth of bacterial pathogens (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas campestris, Clavibacter michiganensis, and Pseudomonas syringae). When cultured in various growth media, NYG5 produced a variety of VOCs. Five distinct VOCs (2-methylbutanoic acid, 5-methyl-2-hexanone, 2,3-hexanedione, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and 6-methyl-2-heptanone) were identified using headspace GC-MS. 2,3-Hexanedione exhibited potent lethal effects on the tested phytopathogens and nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne javanica at a concentration of 50 ppm. In addition, 0.05 ppm 2,3-hexanedione stimulated the expression of pathogenesis-related genes 1 and 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

The conventional treatment using fungicides lead to emerging resistance over the past decades. Here, we introduce Photodynamic Inactivation (PDI) as a strategy to combat B. cinerea infections, independent of fungicide resistance. PDI uses photoactive compounds, which upon illumination create reactive oxygen species toxic for killing target organisms. This study focuses on different formulations of sodium–magnesium–chlorophyllin (Chl, food additive E140) as photoactive compound in combination with EDTA disodium salt dihydrate (Na2EDTA) as cell-wall permeabilizer and a surfactant. In an in vitro experiment, three different photosensitizers (PS) with varying Chl and Na2EDTA concentrations were tested against five B. cinerea strains with different resistance mechanisms. We showed that all B. cinerea mycelial spheres of all tested strains were eradicated with concentrations as low as 224 µM Chl and 3.076 mM Na2EDTA (LED illumination with main wavelength of 395 nm, radiant exposure 106 J cm−2). To further test PDI as a Botrytis treatment strategy in agriculture a greenhouse trial was performed on B. cinerea infected bell pepper plants (Capsicum annum L). Two different rates (560 or 1120 g Ha−1) of PS formulation (0.204 M Chl and 1.279 M Na2EDTA) and a combination of PS formulation with 0.05% of the surfactant BRIJ L4 (560 g Ha−1) were applied weekly for 4 weeks by spray application. Foliar lesions, percentage of leaves affected, percentage of leaf area diseased and AUDPC were significantly reduced, while percentage of marketable plants were increased by all treatments compared to a water treated control, however, did not statistically differ from each other. No phytotoxicity was observed in any treatment. These results add to the proposition of employing PDI with the naturally sourced PS Chl in agricultural settings aimed at controlling B. cinerea disease. This approach seems to be effective regardless of the evolving resistance mechanisms observed in response to conventional antifungal treatments.

The sample preparation method for pesticides involved an optimization of the QuEChERS-based extraction protocol, with sample mass, volume of added water, and the type of cleanup sorbent as variables. A sorbent combination based on ENVI-Carb and ChloroFiltr was examined. A highly efficient method was developed for the purification of plant extracts with 900 mg MgSO4, 150 mg PSA, and 15 mg ENVI-Carb at the d-SPE stage, combined with gas chromatography and liquid tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of 197 pesticides in crop plants containing chlorophyll. The method was validated in accordance with the requirements of international guidelines SANTE/11312/2021. The method was applied to quantify pesticide residues in 29 pairs of green crop plants and plants from the corresponding crop protection zone to verify whether the zones are effective barriers to prevent pesticides from penetrating outside agricultural areas. The number and types of agrochemical preparations were chosen by farmers. In total, more than 60 one- and several-component pesticide formulations were applied to the crops included in the study. The pesticide residues were detected in 21 crop samples and 3 samples from protection zones. Epoxiconazole, an active substance that was banned for use in 2021, was found in a spring barley sample.

However, the environmental application of pesticide CSIA is limited by the general lack of knowledge regarding the initial isotopic composition of active substances in commercially available formulations used by farmers. To address this limitation, we established a database aimed at cataloguing and disseminating isotopic signatures in commercial formulations to expand the use of pesticide CSIA. Our study involved the collection of 25 analytical standards and 120 commercial pesticide formulations from 23 manufacturers. Subsequently, 59 commercial formulations and 25 standards were extracted, and each of their active substance was analyzed for both δ13C (n = 84) and δ15N CSIA (n = 43). The extraction of pesticides did not cause significant isotope fractionation (Δ13C and Δ15N < 1‰). Incorporating existing literature data, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures varied in a relatively narrow range among pesticide formulations for different pesticides (Δ13C and Δ15N < 10‰) and within different formulations for a single substance (Δ13C and Δ15N < 2‰). Overall, this suggests that pesticide CSIA is more suited for identifying pesticide transformation processes rather than differentiating pesticide sources. Moreover, an inter-laboratory comparison showed similar δ13C (Δ13C ≤ 1.2 ‰) for the targeted substances albeit varying GC-IRMS instruments. Insignificant carbon isotopic fractionation (Δ13C < 0.5‰) was observed after 4 years of storing the same pesticide formulations, confirming their viability for long-term storage at 4 °C and future inter-laboratory comparison exercises. Altogether, the ISOTOPEST database, in open access for public use and additional contributions, marks a significant advancement in establishing an environmentally relevant pesticide CSIA approach. © 2024 The Authors",NA,291

Based on the bio-stimulant polyglutamic acid, amphiphilic polymers (mPEG-b-PLG) were constructed, and they assembled into nano micelle. After encapsulating prothioconazole (PTC) into the nano micelle through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions through co-assembly, mPEG-b-PLG-PTC nanospheres with a diameter of approximately 120 nm were prepared. The nanospheres exhibit pH responsiveness for targeted release of pesticides, as well as excellent retention capacity, droplet bounce inhibition ability, and deposition capacity. At the same time, compared with commercial formulations, it has long-term antifungal properties and lower EC50, while its acute toxicity to human cells is lower, which can reduce cell apoptosis by about 63 %. It is also gratifying that the main root length, plant height, and fresh weight of wheat seedlings treated with mPEG-b-PLG have significantly improved, effectively applying carrier materials for synergistic effects. In summary, this work proposes a promising strategy to synergize pesticide carrier materials as active ingredients, providing new ideas for the integration of pesticide and fertilizer, improving pesticide utilization efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,293

Herein, fungicide tebuconazole (TEB) and plant immune inducer poly(salicylic acid) (PSA) co-assembled nanoparticles (TP NPs) are fabricated through non-covalent interactions without the use of any adjuvants. The results show that the obtained TP NPs have excellent physicochemical properties, displaying uniform morphology with an average particle size of 152 nm, low PDI (0.064), and high surface activity. The TP NPs exhibit acid-responsive behaviors, enabling the intelligent release of active ingredients in the specific acidic microenvironment caused by the invasion of plant pathogens. In vitro fungicidal activities of TP NPs are 1.9 and 1.6 times higher than TEB technical against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium graminearum respectively. Additionally, the stimuli-responsive co-delivery fungicidal nanosystem not only has a longer effective duration compared to both TEB technical and TP Mix but also significantly reduces the genetic toxicity of TEB to the plants. Therefore, this fungicide and plant immune inducer co-delivery nanosystem provides a novel strategy for development of multimode synergetic nanopesticide and sustainable plant disease management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,294

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassays used to assess insecticide resistance are based on residual active ingredient (AI) exposure and do not directly relate to FP efficacy. The current pilot study developed a novel compact wind tunnel for mosquito exposure to FP. Caged Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens/quinquefasciatus were exposed to undiluted Biomist®3 + 15 FP (permethrin AI) or air (control) within the wind tunnel, transferred to new cages, and held in a 28 °C incubator. Separate mosquitoes were exposed to residual permethrin AI (8 μg mL−1) in bottle bioassays. Mortality was monitored 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-exposure. RESULTS: Chi-square tests (P < 0.05) showed significantly higher mortality in Aedes compared to Culex populations for most time points in both bioassay and wind tunnel exposure groups. As expected, mosquitoes exposed to Biomist®3 + 15 showed higher mortality rates than bottle bioassay exposure to permethrin. Two Culex colonies resistant to permethrin in bottle bioassays were susceptible to Biomist®3 + 15 in the wind tunnel. CONCLUSION: The novel compact wind tunnel developed here may be an alternative to field trials for testing FP efficacy, avoiding factors such as weather, logistical planning, and extended personnel hours. The wind tunnel could allow programs to conveniently test efficacy of multiple FP. Comparisons of different insecticide exposure methods provide practical information to inform operational decisions. © 2024 The Authors.

However, these emerging nanopesticides need a thorough evaluation compared to current formulations to determine whether their “nano” properties intensify toxicity for non-target organisms. This study assessed the lethal toxicity of three nanopesticides on Daphnia magna. The nanopesticides tested were tebuconazole loaded onto poly-ϵ-caprolactone, nanostructured lipid carriers, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles. Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers. The observed toxicity levels, from highest to lowest, were as follows: pure tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on nanostructured lipid carriers > commercial tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles > tebuconazole-loaded on poly-ϵ-caprolactone. The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling.

[Objective] This study aimed to document potential pesticide formulation misuse in agricultural farms. [Methodology] Inadequate storage practices, incorrect pesticide selection, and pesticide formulation overuse were documented through interviews and photographs on 13 agricultural farms from the Cartago and Guanacaste provinces of Costa Rica between August 2022 and April 2023. [Results] Storage room characteristics in many farms do not comply with safety standards prescribed by the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. Different active ingredients with herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal, and bactericidal properties are used in crop species for which they are not recommended. These substances include those from the carbamate, pyridine, cyclohexanedione, pyrethroid, conazole, benzothiazinone, oxadiazine, and phthalimide chemical groups in Cartago province, and from the neonicotinoid and pyrethroid chemical groups in Guanacaste province. Many pesticide formulations are utilized in quantities exceeding the manufacturers’ recommendations.

Unfortunately, 6 pyrethroid active ingredients represent most commercial insecticides registered for alfalfa weevil control in forage alfalfa systems.Thus, the loss of efficacy of this mode of action group due to multiple resistance represents a significant agricultural challenge because of a limited registered alternative mode of actions. To evaluate the extent and severity of resistance among pyrethroids around the United States, laboratory bioassays using larvae from Arizona, California, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, including both the Egyptian and western strains, were conducted. Results indicated that similar degrees of resistance among type II pyrethroids as determined by both laboratory bioassays and field trials exist. The LC50 values of alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin and zeta-cypermethrin produced significant correlations with the LC50 values of lambda-cyhalothrin.

Researchers are actively exploring the innovative ways to develop various nano-based agro products like nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, etc. for foliar application. Foliar application is a method of treating plants by administering liquid formulations directly onto their leaves. Numerous nanoformulations have recently developed to strengthen foliar application’s efficacy by overcoming many inherent challenges like precise targeting of active compounds to specific plant tissues, improved penetration, and controlled release and reduced environmental impact. Nanoencapsulation provides protection against degradation, prolonging the shelf life of formulations. Plants absorb essential nutrients via stomata, cuticle, and trichomes during foliar application. Foliar nanoformulations offer several advantages over conventional counterparts by providing a direct route for nutrient delivery to plants without relying on the root system or requiring adequate topsoil moisture, under adverse conditions such as root diseases and drought. Notably, these formulations require only small quantities for application while delivering nutrients in a controlled and sustainable manner leading to improved and increased yield quality standards. Timing of foliar spray is pivotal for effectiveness and minimal plant stress. Ideal times are early morning or late evening when temperatures are mild, light is low, and wind speed is minimal. This promotes optimal absorption and minimizes heat stress.

The entire process for conversion of biomass to biofuels and renewable chemicals presents a highly efficient, integrated and a low carbon sustainable alternative to fossil fuels as a solution urgently needed to combat climate change and for meeting the Net Zero Goals by 2050. The integrated process backed by trade secrets and extensive IP involves i) conversion of biomass into bioethanol intermediate via Petron's highly efficient and commercially demonstrated Cellulosic Ethanol G2.0 technology, and ii) dehydration (water removal) of bioethanol into high purity bio-ethylene. The ethylene produced is then purified upto the required grades depending on the downstream applications. The biomass feedstock undergoes efficient pretreatment and is converted into constituent sugars via action of enzymes followed by fermentation into beer (alcohol) with high efficiency and yields. The beer is then purified to produce the required quality of ethanol which can be directly fed into Petron's proprietary Ethanol to Ethylene (EtE) process. The non-converted process residues are used as renewable fuel for green energy production. The bioethanol is dehydrated over a proprietary catalyst to produce high quality ethylene used for plastics, chemical and biofuel production.

Ethoxylate is often used as a pesticide emulsifier. However, the degree of ethoxylation and the existence of dioxane byproducts can significantly affect the performance of emulsifiers. Here, a series of polyoxyethylene tallow amines with the addition of different numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) were synthesized and characterized. Their physical and chemical performances were measured. The ability of POEA as a surfactant to reduce water surface tension and the surface adsorption of molecules were assessed based on the static and dynamic surface tensions. The results show that the surfactant molecules preferentially form a saturated adsorption layer in solution, and the mixed-diffusion-kinetics mechanism dominates the adsorption process. With the increase of the EO addition number, the emulsifying property of POEA increases, while the wetting property gradually decreases and the contact angle increases.

The research aims to develop a methodology that will enable the accurate determination of the mass concentration of diflubenzuron, a widely used active ingredient in pesticide formulations. This is achieved through the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Methods: The proposed method for determining the mass concentration of diflubenzuron using HPLC was developed through a series of experiments and optimisation steps. The sample preparation procedure was optimised to extract the maximum amount of diflubenzuron from the pesticide formulation. Result: The chromatography conditions were optimised to separate diflubenzuron from other components in the sample matrix. A calibration approach was established for accurate quantification of diflubenzuron in the sample based on peak area measurements.

Recent studies sponsored by The Hartz Mountain Corporation, confirm the safety of TCVP as an active ingredient in pet collars. Based upon data from these new studies and results previously relied upon by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the following conclusions have been made: Torsion study data clearly indicate that approximately 93% of released formulation from TCVP containing pet collars is in a liquid phase immediately following activation. Further, even more relevant to human health risk analysis associated with post-application exposures, in vivo data from dogs wearing TCVP pet collars definitively document that TCVP dust released from the collar is rapidly absorbed into the sebum. The maximum ratio of dust to liquid was 0.023% dust to 99.977% liquid. In vivo fur data provide scientific evidence confirming that the mechanism of dissemination of TCVP from pet collars is as a liquid suspended or dissolved in the animal’s sebum, even though it may be released from the collar as a solid. Thus, potential post-application exposure to TCVP, including immediately following collar placement, is almost entirely to a liquid phase. Based upon EPA’s refined and conservative “untrimmed” collar risk assessment, post-application incidental oral hand-to-mouth activity by children aged 1 to <2 years of age results in margins of exposure significantly greater than the level of concern of 1000, and therefore do not present unreasonable health risk. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.",NA,309

While current cosmetic products on the market undergo safety and cytotoxicity testing, it is important to evaluate the effects of pesticide treatments applied before pruning and the toxicity of the by-products to ensure the safety of future formulations. This review addresses a critical discussion on this subject, assessing the potential benefits of their use in topical formulations.

Open wounds provide an ideal niche for colonization by Candida albicans (C. albicans) which poses substantial global health issues owing to delayed wound healing and disordered healing mechanisms. Therefore, proficient innovative therapies that control C. albicans infection and promote wound healing are of imperative importance for the management of wounds and prevention of infection and possible complications. This study aims to design a novel nanocarrier platform based on a hydrogel loaded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and doped with pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and hyaluronic acid (HA), offering an unprecedented opportunity to achieve skin repair and manage C. albicans colonization with an efficient wound healing process. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=100) were assigned to 5 groups and infected with C. albicans and distributed as follows: control positive (untreated) and four cutaneous wound-healing model groups treated topically with commercial cream and PPE-HA-AgNPs at full, 50%, and 25% concentrations for 15 days, respectively. Our findings revealed that the severity of clinical signs, C. albicans burden, and the expression of biofilm-related genes ALS1, HYR1, and PLB1 were diminished following treatment with PPE-HA-AgNPsIII. Notably, the formulated nanocomposite was very effective in extending the release of PPE-HA-AgNPs in infected wounds with retention percentages of 65.4% for PPE-HA-AgNPsIII. Topical administration of PPE-HA-AgNPsIII successfully alleviated the extensive inflammatory response and healed wounded skin via downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 and IL-1 beta, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. Interestingly, PPE-HA-AgNPsIII modulated angiogenic and wound healing markers as evidenced by the downregulation of MMP-9 and the upregulation of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (up to 10 days post-treatment), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), bFGF, EGF, Ki-67, and collagen I and III with efficient wound closure capability. This was evidenced by the lessening of histopathological severity, which accelerated the healing of the infected skin wounds post-treatment with PPE-HA-AgNPs. Overall, our formulated PPE-HA-AgNPs provide an effective innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cutaneous wounds infected with C. albicans with maximized wound healing efficacy, indicating their potential in clinical practice.

Food, water and commercial products are only some examples of the possible ways people get exposed to these mixtures. However, following federal and local guidelines for risk assessment related to chemical exposure, risk analysis focuses on a single substance exposure scenario and not on a mixture, as in real life. Realizing the pronounced gap of this methodology, the real-life risk simulation scenario approach tries to address this problem by investigating the possible effect of long-term exposure to chemical mixtures closely resembling the actual circumstances of modern life. As part of this effort, this study aimed to identify the cumulative effects of pesticides belonging to different classes and commonly used commercial products on long-term exposure with realistic doses. Sprague Dawley rats were given a pesticide mix of active ingredients and formulation chemicals in a daily acceptable dose (ADI) and 10xADI for 90 days. Following thorough everyday documentation of possible side-effects, after 90 days all animals were sacrificed and their organs were examined.

Hydrophobic pollutants with a toxic nature, slow degradation rates, and low solubility pose serious threats to the environment and human health. Decontamination based on conventional chemical surfactants has been found to be toxic, thereby limiting its application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In contrast, biosurfactants synthesized by various microbial species have been considered superior to chemical counterparts due to their non-toxic and economical nature. Some biosurfactants can withstand a wide range of fluctuations in temperature and pH. Recently, biosurfactants have emerged as innovative biomolecules not only for solubilization but also for the biodegradation of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and oil spills. Biosurfactants have been well documented to function as emulsifiers, dispersion stabilizers, and wetting agents. The amphiphilic nature of biosurfactants has the potential to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons and oil spills by reducing interfacial surface tension after distribution in two immiscible surfaces. However, the remediation of contaminants using biosurfactants is affected considerably by temperature, pH, media composition, stirring rate, and microorganisms selected for biosurfactant production. The present review has briefly discussed the current advancements in microbially synthesized biosurfactants, factors affecting production, and their application in the remediation of environmental contaminants of a hydrophobic nature. In addition, the latest aspect of the circular bioeconomy is discussed in terms of generating biosurfactants from waste and the global economic aspects of biosurfactant production.

Thus, different acaricides have been applied as a strategy to control this disease. In the context of Integrated Pest Management, acaricides based on natural compounds, such as organic acids and essentials oils, are chosen by beekeepers to minimize negative effects on colonies and hive products. Considering the variety of natural active ingredients reported to have varroacidal activity and their different application systems, the aim of this work was to synthesize and quantify scientific knowledge on the acaricide performance of natural compounds to control V. destructor populations in Apis mellifera colonies. A systematic revision and a meta-analysis on the percentage of efficacy published for these formulations were conducted by selecting articles published between 2002 and 2022. According to our results, most publications investigated the efficacy of natural compounds in temperate climates and in European honey bee colonies since Varroa control is practically compulsory under these conditions. Thymol (THY) showed higher estimated efficacy compared to oxalic and formic acids (FA) and other essential oils (EOs). Variable efficacies were found in colonies treated with the natural compounds considered in this study according to different doses and application methods. The high between-study heterogeneity found in this revision might be explained by several factors, including the number of colonies and intra-apiary variation.

In this study, we screened an active ingredient, p-cymene (PC), with an excellent inhibitory effect on rice bacterial blight. Subsequently, the PC was successfully loaded onto MSNs via physisorption (PC@MSNs). PC@MSNs, characterized by a regular spherical shape, smooth surface, and an MSN average size of 262.9 nm, achieved an 8.6% drug loading capacity. The release kinetics of the PC from the PC@MSNs demonstrated a sustained release (288 h) pattern influenced by drug diffusion. The efficacy of the PC@MSNs against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae paralleled those of PC. Acute toxicity assays revealed that the PC@MSNs were less toxic to aquatic life (LC50 = 257.867 mg/L) and that the formulation showed no adverse effects on rice seedling growth.

This chapter explores the various mechanisms involved in the release of nanoinsecticide formulations, focusing on how these mechanisms influence the efficacy and environmental impact of these products. Key release mechanisms discussed include diffusion, degradation, and triggered release systems. Diffusion involves the gradual migration of the active ingredient from the nanocarrier into the surrounding environment, while degradation refers to the breakdown of the nanocarrier material, leading to the release of the encapsulated insecticide. Triggered release mechanisms, such as pH-sensitive, temperature-sensitive, or enzymatic release, offer precise control over the timing and location of the insecticide release, enhancing target specificity and reducing off-target effects. The section also examines how formulation parameters, such as carrier material, particle size, and surface modification, affect the release profile and overall performance of nanoinsecticides. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing nanoinsecticide formulations to achieve effective pest control while minimizing environmental impact. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",NA,318

In this work, the problem of effective polymer composite materials with fungicidal properties, which were specially developed to protect the nail from onychomycosis pathogens, was solved. The obtained results give grounds for asserting that the developed polymer composite materials have pronounced fungicidal properties against the causative agents of onychomycosis. Thanks to the optimal composition, the developed polymer materials have the ability to diffuse into the thickness of the nail. It was established that the membrane of bull hooves is the most similar in properties and chemical composition to the human nail and can be used as a model of the human nail in the study of the fungicidal activity of polymers, as well as the determination of the diffusion of active substances in the thickness of the nail. Pronounced diffusion of active substances into the composition of the nail is explained by the presence of urea in the formulation. Also, the effectiveness of the developed polymer materials is influenced by the fact that cation active surfactants, which were not previously used in antifungal agents, were used as active substances. It is shown that almost all the proposed variants of the polymer composite material with fungicidal action are effective against onychomycosis pathogens, except for the variants that contain polyhexamethylenebiguanide hydrochloride as an active substance. The presented results can be useful in the development of polymer composite materials with fungicidal properties for the prevention and treatment of onychomycosis.

Nanopesticides (NPs) are emerging technologies in the field of agriculture and present some advantage over conventional pesticides. They offer durability, stability, and increased efficacy. In addition, NPs also reduce the amount of active ingredients that are generally used in traditional farming. Several types of NPs have been synthesized. These include nanopolymers, nanoemulsions, and nanospheres constituted by diverse materials.

Adjuvant use across Europe remains less widespread compared to regions like the USA, where adjuvants are often recommended or required with certain herbicide applications. This paper highlights the potential benefits of incorporating adjuvants with herbicides in weed control, particularly as a strategy to reduce overall herbicide use. Findings from dose-response research on available adjuvants suggest they may enable the application of lower herbicide rates than typically recommended, without sacrificing effectiveness, thereby contributing to the goal of reducing herbicide use by 50% by 2030 in Europe. Furthermore, literature findings indicate that adjuvants significantly improve weed control by enhancing the performance of active ingredients, with efficacy increases of up to 50% compared to using herbicides alone. The integration of adjuvants into herbicide tank mixtures offers considerable promise, especially for managing herbicide-resistant weeds and achieving effective weed control.

METHODS: Forty-five naturally infested cattle were divided into three experimental groups: T01, treated with fluralaner (2.5 mg/kg) pour-on every 42 days; T02, the cattle received the first treatment with fluralaner on Day 0 but the next treatment involved a weekly visual evaluation; T03, control, received palliative treatment with a spray formulation when the group mean was ≥ 30 ticks. Counts of female R. microplus were performed weekly until day 343, and larval counts on pasture were performed on Days 0, 30, and 60 and every 30 days until Day 330. RESULTS: Using fluralaner, six applications were performed in Group T01, and four were performed in Group T02. In the control group (T03), it was necessary to perform eight palliative acaricide treatments with the spray formulation. The animals in T01 and T02 showed lower mean tick counts (p ≤ 0.05) than the control group (T03) on 28 and 27 of the 49 evaluated dates, respectively. In the paddock where the animals were kept as controls, the R. microplus larvae counts increased to 1458. In the paddocks where the animals were treated with fluralaner, the number was ≤ 19 per paddock during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The different strategic treatment protocols performed with pour-on fluralaner (2.5 mg/kg) over a year in taurine cattle in a tropical region with a history of up to five annual generations of cattle ticks were effective, maintaining levels of R. microplus infestations in animals and in pastures close to zero in most of the study. Depending on the retreatment criterion adopted, the number of applications per year may be lower, resulting in a reduction in the mean cost of acaricide treatment per year and lower exposure of R. microplus populations to the active ingredient, resulting in lower resistance and selection pressure. © 2024.

Recently the farmer still used botanical insecticide to control N. lugens. However, the application of synthetic insecticides generates a lot of negative effects on humans and other useful insects. One of the alternative control strategies that can reduce the negative impact of chemical insecticides is using botanical pesticides from clove oil. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of botanical insecticide formulas with the active ingredient eugenol using different solvents. The study was conducted by testing the toxicity of 12 botanical insecticide formulas with the active ingredient of clove oil with different concentrations of emulsifier, surfactant, and solvent. Each formula was tested for toxicity against 10 adults of N. lugens. The experiment was carried out by spraying the test solution onto the one-month rice plants grown in plastic pots with 15 cm diameter and 20 cm height, covered with mica plastic covered with gauze at the top. Applications were carried out at a concentration of 5 cc/l by spraying the test solution onto the stems of the rice plants where the planthoppers perched. The results showed that the most effective and promising formula to be developed is a formula containing 500 ml of clove oil, 450 ml of carosene, and 50 ml of Silwet HS 312. Besides, it also has the lowest production cost of approximately US$ 7.17 per liter. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.",NA,329

Despite the extensive literature highlighting these therapeutic activities, there remains a significant gap in understanding hesperidin role across other fields. This review aims at demonstrating hesperidin applications beyond pharmaceutical applications, particularly in the food, feed, and environmental fields. For this purpose, a brief description of the biosynthesis pathway of hesperidin in citrus plants is provided as well as its main chemical derivatives. In the food industry, hesperidin and its derivatives are commercialized as dietetic supplements and have been studied as food additives and active ingredients in edible food packaging. Within the feed industry, meat and/or eggs from animals supplemented with hesperidin show higher oxidative stability and prolonged shelf life. Moreover, in the environment research, hesperidin induces plant tolerance against abiotic factors and shows biopesticide activity.

The soil material (n = 5) used for the study was collected from the mollic horizon of two Chernozems differed in physicochemical properties. HM was obtained in the solid state after extracting humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) in NaOH and digesting the mineral fraction in an HF-HCl mixture. For investigation the pure active substance of pendimethalin (PE) and its two commercial products (Penfox 330 EC and Stomp Aqua 455 SC) were used, which were dissolved in hexane and added to the HM. The batch sorption experiment was carried out in accordance with OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals No.106. Spectroscopic methods (UV-Vis-nearIR and fluorescence) were used to assess the molecular characteristics of HM exposed to pesticides. The study showed significant differences in the molecular structures of the tested HM as a result of interactions with the pesticides used. The PE has a different effect than commercial products. The obtained results prove that the composition of commercial products significantly modifies the strength and ability of organic matter to bind pesticides. This is probably related to the presence of adjuvants that are more competitive in forming bonds with the active sorption sites of HM, and thus strengthen or weaken the process of forming pesticide-HM complexes. © 2024, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Herein, the summer host plants (Gossypium hirsutum and Brassica pekinensis) preferred by PWFs and the winter host plant (Prunella vulgaris) preferred by gynoparae and males were screened from 17 tested host plants. In addition, active components that elicited the electrophysiological responses of the antennae of three winged morphs were identified. Y-tube olfactometer bioassays showed that active volatile compounds such as dibutyl phthalate, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and α-pinene were significant attractants for three winged morphs. The identified olfactory active volatile compounds (OAVCs) were formulated at different ratios into 18 attractant formulae, of which 4 formulae exhibited desirable luring-enhancing effect on PWFs, gynoparae, and males. Styrene, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, a-pinene, and others were dominant ingredients.

The toxicity of abamectin, the active ingredient in the commercial pesticide formulation Alopec® EC, was evaluated using cytogenetic and comet assays on Allium cepa root tips. Mitotic index (MI) and phase index (PI) values were used for cytotoxicity assessment. Chromosomal aberration (CA) frequencies in the dividing cells and comet data were used for genotoxicity assessment. The root growth test showed a significant concentration-based decline in root growth after abamectin exposure, with a median effective concentration (EC50) of 2.50 mg/L. Following 96-hour exposure to three concentrations of abamectin (1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mg/L), cytogenetic and comet analyses indicated a significant concentration- and time-dependent decrease in the MI, alongside an increase in DNA damage. Additionally, there was a significant concentration-dependent rise in the total frequency of CAs. These findings show that abamectin is a pesticide with lethal effects on A. cepa root tip meristematic cells, even at lower concentrations, over prolonged exposure times, with CA-forming and DNA-damaging effects, and that it is highly cytotoxic and genotoxic. © 2024 by the authors",NA,333

An experimental laboratory study was performed to examine the larvicidal activity of ethanolic extract from red dragon fruit skin. Maceration method was used to extract active compounds from the fruit skin. Subsequently, the viscous extract was formulated using the wet granulation method to obtain powder form. The larvicide test was done by comparing the lethal concentration (LC50) of mosquito larvae after treatment using the extract and the reference larvicide agent, 1% Temephos Abate. The treatment groups consisted of four different extract concentrations of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%. The LC50 of each treatment groups was then calculated against the negative control group.

Five species of Botryosphaeriaceae (Diplodia seriata, Dothiorella omnivora, Neofusicoccum macroclavatum, N. parvum, and Spencermartinsia viticola) were recovered from the Australian walnut orchards in a previous study, with D. seriata and N. parvum being the most prevalent. The present study evaluated inhibitory effects of ten fungicides on mycelium growth of those five species and on conidium germination of D. seriata and N. parvum. It investigated the preventative and curative efficacy of selected fungicides on disease incidence in glasshouse and field trials. In vitro experiments showed that nine of the fungicides reduced mycelium growth, and all ten inhibited conidium germination, but to varying extents. Tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride, fluazinam, fludioxonil and pyraclostrobin were the most effective for inhibiting mycelium growth (EC50 < 0.14 μg a.i. mL-1), whereas pyraclostrobin, fluxapyroxad, fluopyram, penthiopyrad and tebuconazole were the most effective for inhibiting conidium germination (EC50 < 2.2 μg a.i. mL-1). In planta experiments with five fungicides confirmed that preventative treatments had greater efficacy than curative treatments. A field trial with four commercial fungicide formulations demonstrated that tebuconazole and tebuconazole + fluopyram provided protection of walnut trees for the longest period. The field trial also confirmed the efficacy of pyraclostrobin and the inhibitory effect of fluazinam. This study is the first in Australia to evaluate fungicides in different classes and with different modes of action for efficacy against Botryosphaeriaceae recovered from walnut orchards in Australia, and provides a wider selection of active ingredients for a fungicide rotation programme than that which is currently available to the Australian walnut industry. © 2024 S.

To achieve the SDG 2030 agenda goal 12- “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,” there is an urgent need to shift towards using toxic-free agricultural inputs. Various techniques are widely adopted to control weed growth and development, but farmers mostly rely on herbicide application. Nanotechnology-enabled herbicide formulations are more sustainable and efficient in weed control than traditional sources. The nanoherbicides enable lesser application frequency and minimum quantity requirement, thereby preventing herbicide accumulation in soil and water bodies. Mainly nano-mediated biodegradable carrier-based herbicides possess properties of prolonged release, targeted inhibition, reduced mobility in soil, better adhesion to the plant surface, and retards rapid degradation of active ingredients (AIs), which increase herbicide use efficiency against weeds. Biodegradable carrier materials are cost-effective and readily available from living/non-living organisms and mineral sources, which can be an alternate source for metal/metal-oxide carrier materials. Materials like chitosan, plant derivatives, clay particles, and synthetic polymers are notable carrier materials reported for encapsulating or loading herbicide molecules. Applying nano-mediated herbicides is an innovative methodology for controlling weeds while considering environmental safety.

Pesticide mixtures containing insecticide methomyl are commonly used in agriculture. However, the interaction of their active ingredients in a mixture has been insufficiently studied. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the nature of the combined action of a mixture of insecticides methomyl (carbamate) and bifenthrin (pyrethroid) using various methods: a classical model (orthogonal planning of the experiment using nonlinear variables); a generalized linear regression model for the binomial distribution (probit regression); and an isobologram. The study was conducted at the Federal Scientific Center of Hygiene named after F.F. Erisman of the Federal Service for Supervision in Protection of the Rights of Consumer and Man Wellbeing, according to the protocol approved by the local bioethical commission. Materials and methods. Ninety male outbred rats were administered 9 combined doses of the insecticides (combinations of LD16, LD33 and LD50 for the individual compounds, as devised from a preliminary study). Results. Impaired coordination, tremor of the limbs and head, turning into convulsions, rapid (shallow) breathing were observed in all groups. The data on mortality as used to construct 2 mathematical models, as well as to construct an isobologram. Limitations. The study was limited to studying the indicators of acute oral toxicity, without taking into account the possible repeated exposure. Conclusion. The models showed that the additive effect for the combination of methomyl and bifenthrin was only observed for combinations when the individual dose of bifenthrin was equal to or greater than 45 mg/kg b.w.

Wheat is infested with different weeds that cause yield losses (up to 100%) that vary based on the type of weed, their density, and the environmental conditions. Chemical weed control is the most common method to control weeds in wheat. However, widespread herbicide resistance (>365 cases worldwide) has challenged the sustainability of this method. Use of nanoherbicides is a promising strategy to cope with the issue of herbicide resistance. To achieve weed control conditions during the whole growing season, nanoformulations of herbicides are a delivery strategy that involves covering an active component with various materials that vary in size from nano to nanoscale and then releasing the substance in a controlled manner. Nanoherbicides prevent leaching and volatilization of active components and premature degradation through photolysis, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. According to studies, nanoencapsulation of herbicides produces more targeted and less hazardous agricultural formulations. Using nanoherbicides in lower concentrations is beneficial. It lessens the long-term impacts of herbicide residues in wheat fields and the toxicity of these herbicides to the environment. It is also beneficial in eliminating the weeds without ever interacting with the crop plants, which eventually results in a greater wheat yield. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of utilizing nanoparticles (NPs) in herbicides for effective weed management in wheat crops. This article explores the novel approach of integrating NPs with herbicidal agents, highlighting their potential benefits and challenges.

Since this insect is an anthropophilic mosquito that has evolved to thrive in urban settings and is common in Brazil and other tropical nations, controlling its population growth is difficult. The two basic methods of control are eradicating its breeding grounds and applying pesticides. There have been reports of pesticide resistance emerging as well as DEET's potential danger for people, particularly youngsters. Therefore, research has been done to find novel insecticides and repellents. In this way, the goal of this research was to assess thymol's insecticidal and repellent activities in Ae. aegypti. Bioassays were performed with eggs, larvae and adults exposed to different concentrations of thymol. The findings demonstrated that thymol has insecticidal effect in both the immature and adult phases, eliminating the larvae in 24 hours. In addition, necrosis was observed in hemocytes, without alteration in the production of nitric oxide by the insects. When evaluating repellency, thymol showed 99.5% of landing inhibition. This leads to the conclusion that thymol can be employed as an active component in the formulation of insecticides and repellents for the Ae. aegypti mosquito. © (2024), (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

Established nanosystems can be enhanced or modified to generate new biological activity patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of chitosan coating of PCL+ATZ NCs on herbicidal activity and interaction mechanisms with Bidens pilosa plants. Chitosan-coated NCs (PCL/CS+ATZ) were synthesized and characterized for size, zeta potential, polydispersity, and encapsulation efficiency. Herbicidal efficiency was assessed in postemergence greenhouse trials, comparing the effects of PCL/CS+ATZ NCs (coated), PCL+ATZ NCs (uncoated), and conventional atrazine (ATZ) on photosystem II (PSII) activity and weed control. Using a hydroponic system, we evaluated the root absorption and shoot translocation of fluorescently labeled NCs. PCL/CS+ATZ presented a positive zeta potential (25 mV), a size of 200 nm, and an efficiency of atrazine encapsulation higher than 90%. The postemergent herbicidal activity assay showed an efficiency gain of PSII activity inhibition of up to 58% compared to ATZ and PCL+ATZ at 96 h postapplication. The evaluation of weed control 14 days after application ratified the positive effect of chitosan coating on herbicidal activity, as the application of PCL/CS+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha-1 resulted in better control than ATZ at 2000 g of a.i. ha-1 and PCL+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha-1. In the hydroponic experiment, chitosan-coated NCs labeled with a fluorescent probe accumulated in the root cortex, with a small quantity reaching the vascular cylinder and leaves up to 72 h after exposure. This behavior resulted in lower leaf atrazine levels and PSII inhibition than ATZ. In summary, chitosan coating of nanoatrazine improved the herbicidal activity against B. pilosa plants when applied to the leaves but negatively affected the root-to-shoot translocation of the herbicide.

Decontamination of these compounds from the contaminated surfaces is an important step in their poisoning incident management but techniques that are commonly used currently, washings with soap solutions are not effective as the contaminants are still active in the waste solutions. Addition of an active ingredient such as an oxime which acts as a nucleophile in the soap solutions will enhance the ability of the washing liquids to hydrolyse OPs to convert them into innocuous compounds. This article describes a procedure to synthesize and characterize oxime-incorporated palm oil-based liquid soaps with an oxime concentration in the range of 0.05–1% and the results of their evaluation for their decontamination efficacy to degrade the OPs into non-toxic compounds. The soaps were formulated from palm oil and stable with the pH of 11.0, which is within the pH range for decontamination purposes. Upon mixing the soap solutions with Methyl Parathion (MP), the MP degrades slowly with the formation of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) after 24h which appears at peaks 400nm of the UV-Visible spectrum. However, in the presence of 2-pyridine aldoxime methiodide (2-PAM) with concentrations of 0.05% to 1.0%, the degradation is immediately observed involving the 2-PAM/MP complexation, in addition to the formation of p-NP after 24h. Furthermore, with the concentration of 2-PAM of 0.5% to 1.0%, the degradation does not produce p-NP but dimethylthiophosphate (DMPT) suggesting that the oxime content in the soap is sufficient to neutralise the MP. Based on the above findings, it can be concluded that the addition of the 2-PAM at the right concentration into the soaps significantly enhances their ability to efficiently decontaminate MP. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

However, more information is needed to know about the behavior of nanopesticides in media used for ecotoxicological tests. In this work, the release and stability of two tebuconazole (TBZ) nanoformulations (TBZ loaded into poly-ϵ-caprolactone [PCL] or into nano-lipids [NLC]) were evaluated in Milli-Q water (control) and two media used broadly in ecotoxicological tests: reconstituted water (RCW) and Elendt M7 solution. The results suggested that the release of TBZ depended mainly on the TBZ concentration in the system with faster release at lower concentration levels. TBZ release was also influenced by the type of nanocarrier. For instance, for RCW and concentration of 50 μg mL−1, TBZ release from NLC (plateau% = 44.7 ± 2.6) was higher than from PCL (plateau% = 17.8 ± 2.6). Similar trends were also found for other concentrations and the other medium, M7. The colloidal stability of the nanoformulations declined as the concentration of the stabilizing agents decreased. Our results show that it is essential to consider the factors that could influence both the release and stability of the nanopesticides in ecotoxicological media since these phenomena can affect the exposure of organisms to pesticides and, therefore, the results of ecotoxicological tests. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry",NA,354

Commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos (COM) are the pesticides most widely used in agricultural activities, with a high toxic potential on amphibians. However, little is known about the separate effects of the active ingredient (CPF) and adjuvants (AD). We studied the thermal sensitivity at different concentrations and pesticide fractions in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles, on thermal tolerance limits (CTmax = Critical thermal maximum and CTmin = Critical thermal minimum), swimming speed (Ss), Optimum temperature (Top), and Thermal breadth 50 (B50). Our results demonstrate that the pesticide active ingredient, the adjuvants, and the commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos differentially impair the thermal sensitivity of R. arenarum tadpoles. The pesticide fractions affected the heat and the cold tolerance (CTmax and CTmin), depending on the concentrations they were exposed to. The locomotor performance (Ss, Top, and B50) of tadpoles also varied among fractions, treatments, and environmental temperatures. In the context of climate change, the outcomes presented are particularly relevant, as mean temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates, which suggests that tadpoles inhabiting warming and polluted ponds are currently experiencing deleterious conditions. Considering that larval stages of amphibians are the most susceptible to changing environmental conditions and the alarming predictions about environmental temperatures in the future, it is likely that the synergism between high temperatures and pesticide exposure raise the threat of population deletions in the coming years. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,355

However, limited information exists on using polyethoxylated tallow amine concentrations to predict clinical outcomes. We investigated if plasma concentrations of glyphosate, its metabolite and polyethoxylated tallow amines can predict acute kidney injury and case fatality in glyphosate poisoning. Methods: We enrolled 151 patients with acute glyphosate poisoning between 2010 and 2013. Plasma concentrations of glyphosate, its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid, and polyethoxylated tallow amines were determined in 2020 using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Associations between exposure and poisoning severity were assessed. Results: Plasma concentrations of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid demonstrated good and moderate performances in predicting acute kidney injury (≥2), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.69–0.97) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.59–0.94), respectively. Polyethoxylated tallow amines were detected in one-fifth of symptomatic patients, including one of four fatalities and those with unsaturated tallow moieties being good indicators of acute kidney injury (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥0.7). As the number of repeating ethoxylate units in tallow moieties decreased, the odds of acute kidney injury increased. Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid concentrations were excellent predictors of case fatality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >0.9). Discussion: The 2.7% case fatality rate with 49% acute, albeit mild, acute kidney injury following glyphosate poisoning is consistent with previously published data. A population approach using model-based metrics might better explore the relationship of exposure to severity of poisoning. Conclusions: Plasma concentrations of glyphosate and its metabolite predicted the severity of clinical toxicity in glyphosate poisoning. The co-formulated polyethoxylated tallow amine surfactants were even more strongly predictive of acute kidney injury but were only detected in a minority of patients. © 2024 The Author(s).

One major challenge with pyrethroids is their perceived repellency. This perception can influence decisions made by pest control operators, especially when insecticides are used to reduce insect entry into or movement within structures. One major indoor pest that has been repeatedly shown to be repelled by some pyrethroids is the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. However, most experiments evaluating pyrethroid repellency in the German cockroach have used end-point assays, which do not provide information on the movement that led to the final position. Therefore, we evaluated the kinetic behavioral response of field-collected German cockroaches to five pyrethroid-based products and their active ingredients (A.I.) in open behavioral arenas using advanced video tracking software. In addition, in an effort to compare our free-moving experiments with end-point assays, we evaluated sheltering behavior using two-choice harborage arrestment assays where German cockroaches were provided a choice between pyrethroid-treated and untreated shelters. RESULTS: All pyrethroid-formulated products and their respective A.I.'s failed to affect field-collected German cockroach movement behavior in free-moving assays, while positive controls (DEET, corn mint oil) resulted in reduced time spent by German cockroaches in treated areas. However, despite their willingness to move over pyrethroids-treated surfaces, field-collected German cockroaches displayed a reduced propensity to arrest on pyrethroids treated tents. CONCLUSION: While most pyrethroids/pyrethroid-formulated products affected German cockroach arrestment, pyrethroids and pyrethroid-formulated products failed to change German cockroach movement behavior in free-moving assays. These results indicate the pyrethroids tested act as contact irritants rather than true-spatial repellents on field-collected German cockroaches. This distinction is critical to refining pest management strategies involving pyrethroids. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,362

Triton X-100 was preferred than Triton X-114 as a surfactant to produce the clouding phenomenon and hexane or isooctane was found to be appropriate organic solvents which can be used at the back-extraction step. It was observed that ca. 0.09 % w/w Triton X-100 was co-extracted in the organic phase (hexane or isooctane) so further study was carried out to find out its effect on the GC-MS (GC-MS/MS) measurement when liquid samples are injected without any pre-cleaning to remove the surfactant. The chromatographic separation and the mass detection were not deteriorated by the concomitant Triton X-100 for analysis of several Organochlorine and Organophosphorus pesticides (alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH, Pentachlorobenzene, Hexachlorobenzene, Chlorpyrifos, Chlorpyrifos-methyl, Aldrin, Endrin, Dieldrin, alpha-Endosulfan, Heptachlor, Heptachlor-endo-epoxide-A, o,p-DDD, p,p-DDD, o,p-DDE, p,p-DDE, o,p-DDT and p,p-DDT). The stability of the GC system when introducing surfactant was assessed as acceptable (typically the peak area RSD% for 20 consecutive injections were below 5 %). Under the developed vaporization conditions using PTV or PSS injectors it can be deduced that Triton X-100 is deposited on the inner surface of the liner. This effect is beneficial since the resulting surfactant layer makes a surface which facilitates the pesticides transfer to the GC column. As a consequence, for some analytes, a substantial enhancement (up to 2.3 times) in the sensitivity was observed when the matrix-matched medium (0.09 % w/w Triton X-100 in organic solvent) is used compared to calibration in solely hexane or isooctane. Meanwhile, the measurement precision in the presence of Triton X-100 remains unchanged. The GC-MS/MS analysis was alternatively accomplished by the use of glass or metal liner and it was found that the glass one should be preferable. Finally, it can be concluded that cloud point extraction with Triton X-100 can be combined with GC-MS or GC-MS/MS analysis by applying liquid injection of the target analytes transferred in organic solvents such as hexane or isooctane. We have established a positive effect of Triton X-100 on the instrumental performance which is on opposite to the generally accepted concern of the negative influence of the surfactants on the gas chromatographic analysis. © 2023 The Authors",NA,363

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity and genotoxic effects of the S-metolachlor (SM)-based herbicide Dual Gold® (DG®), on Leptodactylus luctator tadpoles (Anura: Leptodactylidae). To assess the toxicity of the herbicide, including the median lethal concentration (LC50) at 24h, the no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC), and the lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC), tadpoles were exposed to five nominal concentrations of DG® (5.0, 6.2, 7.8, 9.8, and 12.2 mg/L), and to dechlorinated water as a negative control (NC). The LC5024h of DG® was 7.0 mg/L, the NOEC was 5.0 mg/L and the LOEC=6.2 mg/L. L. luctator tadpoles were sensitive to the herbicide, reaching 100% mortality after 24 h of exposure to the highest concentration tested (12.2 mg/L). To evaluate the potential genotoxicity of the herbicide, the frequencies of micronuclei (MN) and other erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were determined in larvae exposed to three nominal concentrations of DG® (1.0, 5.0, and 6.2 mg/L) for 48 and 96 h. The frequencies of MN and ENA were compared with a positive control (40 mg/L of Cyclophosphamide) and a negative control. The frequencies of MN and ENA in the erythrocytes of tadpoles exposed to the test concentrations of DG® and Cyclophosphamide were significantly higher than in the negative control group at both 48 and 96 h (with the only exception of MN at 1.0 mg/L at 48 h). Our results confirm the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of this widely used herbicide in agriculture, a fact that represents a potential risk to amphibians that develop in ponds associated with or immersed in agroecosystems. © 2024, Asociacion Iberica de Limnologia.

An adaptable separation technique has been developed, enabling the qualitative and quantitative analysis of clopyralid, picloram, and aminopyralid within pesticide formulations in line with SANCO/3030/99 rev. 5 guidelines. This article offers an insight into the validation procedure encompassing key aspects such as selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. It places emphasis on critical stages, including sample preparation, chromatographic separation, detection, quantification, and data analysis. The active ingredients are separated using chromatography with isocratic elution, utilizing a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of water, acetonitrile, and acetic acid in a specific ratio (83:15:2 v/v/v). This separation is carried out on a YMC-Pack ODS-AQ column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The method’s validation parameters have produced satisfactory outcomes. The recovery rates for each individual compound were found to be in the range of 98.6% to 101.0%.

However, the availability of larvicides that meet the criteria of efficacy, safety, and quality is limited and conventional pesticides are no longer preferred for larval control. Although efforts are made to research new active ingredients (AIs), it is equally important to innovate new formulations based on currently available AIs such as microbial agents and insect growth regulators. Studies were therefore conducted to compare the laboratory activity and semi-field efficacy of OmniPrenew G and Altosidw Pellets with DR-tech, both containing 4.25% S-methoprene, at 2.8 kg/ha and 11.2 kg/ha against the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) in outdoor microcosms. Both products performed equally in bioassays against the test species with comparable inhibition of emergence activities. In the semi-field study, the lower dose of Altosid Pellets at 2.8 kg/ha, showed lower efficacy than OmniPrene G during the initial 6 weeks; this difference became negligible on week 7, followed by higher efficacy in Altosid Pellets on weeks 8 and 9. More uniform efficacy was observed at the higher dose of 11.2 kg/ha. Equal performance was revealed during weeks 2 to 6, with the OmniPrene G outperforming the Altosid Pellets in week 1, but the opposite during weeks 7 to 9. Mortality patterns were similar in both products, i.e., majority of mortality occurred before emergence, although more incomplete emergence was noted in lower doses, particularly in Altosid Pellets. Overall, newly available OmniPrene G provided comparable activity and efficacy with Altosid Pellets against the test species, with the advantages of fast initial AI release and even coverage, particularly when applied at low doses.  © 2024 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.",NA,367

The objective of this research was to determine how nano insecticides influence the social economy and bio-economy when it came to achieving socio-economic development goals. Many nanoformulations have been produced as a result of nanotechnology research and can be used in crop protection, such as nanoinsecticides, nanoherbicides, nanofungicides, and nanonematicides. Nano-insecticides are intended to increase solubility, limit active ingredient release, and inhibit degradation. Organic polymer-based formulations, lipid-based formulations, nanosized metals and metal oxides, clay-based nanomaterials, and other chemical nature carrier molecule changes have all been made to achieve these goals. This article discusses some of the most important nano-formulations.

GBHs are commonly used worldwide in weed control management. Due to their extensive application, they frequently occur in aquatic ecosystems and may affect various organisms. The active substance GLY and its major by-product, AMPA, are the most thoroughly studied chemicals; however, the adverse effects of the complex formulas of GBHs with diverse and unknown content of co-formulants are still not sufficiently researched. This study focused on the embryotoxicity, sublethal malformations, and estrogenic potency of GLY, AMPA, and four commonly used GBHs on zebrafish embryos using a wild type and an estrogen-sensitive, transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(vtg1:mCherry)). After 120 h of exposition, AMPA did not cause acute toxicity, while the LC50 of GLY was 160 mg/L. The GBHs were more toxic with LC50 values ranging from 31 to 111 GLY active equivalent (a.e.) mg/L. Exposure to 0.35–2.8 mg/L GBHs led to sublethal abnormalities: typical symptoms were structural deformation of the lower jaw and anomalies in the olfactory region. Deformity rates were 10–30% in the treated groups. In vivo, fluorescently expressed vtg1 mCherry protein in embryonic liver was detected by a non-invasive microscopic method indicating estrogenic action through vitellogenin production by GLY, AMPA, and GBHs. To confirm the in vivo findings, RT-qPCR method was performed to determine the levels of the estrogenicity-related vtg1 mRNA. After 120 h of exposure to GLY, AMPA, and three GBHs at a concentration of 0.35 mg/L, the expression of vtg1 gene was significantly up-regulated.

Nevertheless, the mortality rate in patients with acute glyphosate-surfactant poisoning varies across different groups. Methods: Between 2002 and 2020, 109 patients with glyphosate-surfactant poisoning received treatment at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were stratified into two subgroups according to their prognosis: good (n = 74) or poor (n = 35). Baseline demographics, psychiatric comorbidities, medical complications, and laboratory data were collected, and mortality data were analyzed. Results: The patients were 54.1 ± 17.5 years of age and were mostly male (68.8%). Most patients (91.7%) ingested pesticides intentionally, and patients arrived at the hospital within 7.1 ± 12.7 h. Psychiatric comorbidities were prevalent, and the top three comorbidities were mental (71.6%), depressive (48.6%), and adjustment (14.7%) disorder. Patients with poor prognoses were older than those with good prognoses (p =.007). Moreover, patients with poor prognoses had lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (p <.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p =.008), but higher incidences of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (p <.001), aspiration pneumonia (p <.001), hypotension (p <.001), hyperglycemia (p =.002), acute kidney injury (p <.001), and metabolic acidosis (p <.001) than patients with good prognoses. The mortality rate was 5.5%. A multivariate-logistic-regression model revealed that the Glasgow Coma Scale score was a significant risk factor for poor prognosis (odds ratio 0.653, confidence interval 0.427–0.998; p =.049). However, no risk factors for mortality were identified. Conclusions: A total of 32.1% of patients with glyphosate-surfactant poisoning had poor prognoses, and 5.5% of patients died despite treatment.

Limited information exists on the import volumes, usage, environmental fate, and human health effects of pesticides in El Salvador. Objective. To identify import trends and the relative contribution of each active ingredient to the global volume of pesticide imports during the period 2013-2021. Materials and methods. Import records of pesticides provided by the Import Registration and Supervision Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock of El Salvador (MAG) for the period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2021, were classified by active ingredient (a.i.). For each import event, the net quantity of each a.i. was calculated based on the technical data sheet of the commercial product. Each a.i. was categorized based on its properties into one of the following categories: herbicides, fumigants and soil disinfectants, insecticides-nematicides, fungicides-bactericides, molluscicides, and rodenticides. Results. Herbicides were imported in the largest volumes, followed by fumigants and soil disinfectants, insecticides-nematicides, fungicides-bactericides, molluscicides, and rodenticides. The most imported herbicides, in descending order, were 2,4-D, paraquat, glyphosate, and atrazine; for fumigants and soil disinfectants, methyl bromide, aluminum phosphide, and metam sodium; for fungicides-bactericides, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, carbendazim, and propineb; for insecticides-nematicides, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, terbufos, and malathion; for molluscicides, metaldehyde; and for rodenticides, coumatetralyl and diphacinone, respectively. Conclusions. From 2013 to 2021, among the most imported a.i. by volume, there was a notable increase in glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, and mancozeb, while imports of terbufos declined. Other a.i. showed minimal variation, were imported in smaller volumes, or are no longer imported due to international regulations on the trade and use of chemical substances, and market demand. © 2024 Universidad de Costa Rica.

At first, plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) were controlled by the same products used against insect pests (carbon disulfide, chloropicrin, methyl bromide), but since 1940, with the discovery of the nematicide activity of the soil fumigant DD (dichlopropane-dichloropropene), chemical nematicides played a pivotal role in increasing the yield of many agricultural crops. In the second half of the past century and especially during its last two decades, the high demand from the farmers for chemical products having immediate nematicidial activity stimulated the interest of many chemical companies in patenting and marketing an increasing number of new chemical products. They were both fumigants (methyl bromide, chloropicrin, dibromoethane, bromochloropropane, dichloroethane, dichloropropane, dichloropropene, dazomet, metam sodium, metam potassium, methyl isothiocyanate, dimethyldisulfide) and non-fumigants (aldicarb, abamectin, benfuracarb, cadusaphos, carbosulfan, carbofuran, benfuracarb, fosthiazate, fluopyram, fenamiphos, ethoprophos, oxamyl, iprodione, thionazin). In the meantime, awareness increased about the negative impact of plant protection products were having on the environment and the need to regulate their approval and use in the European Union (EU). This resulted in a number of EU decrees adopted by all member States to restrict the marketing and use of these products. This led to a drastic reduction in p.a. nematicides on the market, which are already in limited numbers compared to fungicides and insecticides. In this phase of transition towards eco-sustainable agriculture, as alternative products are not yet available for all crops and for all the different species of parasitic nematodes, agricultural operators are having considerable difficulties. The future of the market for synthetic nematicides is not promising. Today, only a handful of active ingredients (dazomet, metam sodium, metam potassiium fenamiphos, fosthiazate, fluopyran, abamectin) are registered in EU. However, studies are underway to search for less polluting products, such as plant extracts, volatile organic compounds, and nano-formulations. The use of these products should be integrated with the implementation of appropriate crop systems, the use of cover crops, soil amendments, rigorous sanitation practices, and resistant planting material, obtained both by conventional and modern technique, for a sustainable control of PPN. © 2024 CREA-DC, Research Centre for Plant Protection and Certification.

This herbicide has a wide range of effects on fish, including physiological, genetic, neurological, and hemato-immunological impacts. In the current study, p-Coumaric acid (P-CA) was used as a feed additive for its potential benefits in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to Ronstar using hematological, immunological, and biochemical analyses. The fish (16.02 ± 0.27 g) was divided into eight treatments as follows: C (negative control), P1, P2, and P3 (0.5, 1, and 1.5 g P-CA/kg, respectively, with no toxin), R1, P1R1, P2R1, and P3R1 (12.5% Ronstar toxin with 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 g P-CA/kg, respectively), each with a replicate of three. According to the two-way ANOVA test (P<0.05), the overall trend of changes were growth, antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), and malondialdehyde level, humoral immune system (total immunoglobulin levels (total Ig)), lysozyme, complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), ACH50, serum nitroblue tetrazolium, and myeloperoxid. The only parameters that were unaffected by P-CA were globulin, albumin, and cortisol; however, Ronstar had negative effects on all three of these measures as well. It was found that the positive effects of dietary P-CA may ameliorate the negative effects of Ronstar in rainbow trout in a dose-dependent manner, with the best performance for the treatment P-CA + Ronstar. However, it is crucial to evaluate the mitigating effects of dietary P-CA against Ronstar on some vital organs of rainbow trout, especially the liver, at histological levels in future studies.  © 2024 Jianbin Ye et al.",NA,373

There are several chemicals like 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), paraquat and rotenone that can induce PD in various animal model systems. Amongst these, one of the most common chemicals found in herbicides such as Paraquat (PQ) showed a link associated between the incidences of PD to its level of exposure. In the present study, several tools were used to predict the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of selected molecules that can be targeted towards treatment of PD. This research focuses on understanding the role of key genes LRRK2 (Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), GBA (Glucocerebrosidase) and APOE4 encoding for apolipoprotein E (apoE) which on mutations lead to adverse effects in the body eventually contributing to PD. Through AutoDock of these three targets with 34 ligands it was found that tolcapone showed the best binding energy of −5.99 kcal/mol followed by natural compounds such as Resveratrol (−5.12 kcal/mol) and Curcumin (−4.49 kcal/mol). Although, synthetic drugs such as Metformin and Tolcapone showed binding energy of −7.88 kcal/mol and −7.62 kcal/mol respectively, natural compounds, Curcumin and Resveratrol showed binding energy of −7.13 kcal/mol and−6.49 kcal/mol respectively, close to synthetic drugs for GBA target. Curcumin and its derivatives docked to APOE4 showed binding energy ranging between −2.18 kcal/mol to −5.95 kcal/mol. ADME properties indicated that most of the compounds exhibited good bioavailability and leadlikeness. Potential Transdermal Administration indicated Foslevodopa to be a potential candidate due to its high negative log Kp value. Favorable PASS and SOM Predictions demonstrated that compounds with high Pa (>0.7) and low Pi (<0.5) are considered potential leads for Parkinson’s treatment.

It was prepared through one pot hot melt ultrasonication technique with easy water dispersability and long term stability. The effective surface-active agent concentration which controls the size and stability of nano bio-fungicide was studied. The small particle size (158 nm) and narrow particle distribution (0.36) were obtained for the nano bio-fungicide at 20 mg of lecithin and 100 mg of surfactant concentration. The physico-chemical analysis revealed that, nano bio-fungicides were amorphous sphere-shaped nanoparticles with low melting point. The greater molecular level affinity of essential oil towards lipids and their interfacial interaction towards essential oil to achieve stabilised dispersion in aqueous environment were deciphered through molecular dynamics simulation. The unique preferential binding of eugenol, bornanone and cinnamaldehyde with the hydrocarbon chain of glycerol monostearate and phospholipid enhanced their biological stability in aqueous environment by preventing its autoxidation. It was further confirmed through accelarated ageing studies. The major components of essential oil like alpha-terpineol, linalool, thymol and cinamaldehyde had an encapsulation efficiency of 29 %, 65 %, 21 % and 50 % respectively. Subsequently, all these bioactives of essential oil follows Higuchi model of release kinetics. Besides, the essential oil loaded nanostructured lipid carrier had significantly higher mycelial growth inhibition than pure essential oil at the same concentration. Thus, our results suggest that essential oil compactly packed at the intramolecular spaces of lipids and surfactants were having enhanced bio-efficacy with long term storage potential. Hence, the present nano-biofungicide could be a good alternative to the harsh pesticidal chemicals with easy and simple large scale production protocol for the eco- friendly management of wilt disease caused by Fuarium oxysporum. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,375

The article describes the current issues associated with agricultural pesticide, analyzes the development directions on the global pesticide market, and predicts its impact on the Russian economy. To analyze the global market of chemical plant protection products, the authors applied an integrated approach based on analysis, synthesis, analogy, comparison, and forecasting. The research relied on the domestic laws and standards issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance. Other sources included statistics obtained from foreign agencies (Phillips McDougal; Kynetec; NBS, China; Chemexcil, India) and Russian institutions (Rosstat, BusinesStat, Zerno.ru, etc.). The review included articles published in scientific and analytical databases, i.e., eLIBRARY.RU, AgroXXI, and AgroPages in 2018–2024. The analysis concentrated on India, China, and the Russian Federation. It covered absolute and relative harvest losses, as well as the market share of importing countries and key suppliers on Russian pesticide market. The demand for chemical pesticides continues to grow, despite restrictions or prohibitions of some hazardous pesticides. Some active ingredients were partially unavailable while finished formulations were subjected to import quotas. In 2024, Russia will be using as many chemical plant protection products as in 2023 since the domestic warehouses store large reserves. The weather conditions are likely to ensure optimal plant growth. Russian farmers will harvest about 142 million tons of grain, including 92–95 million tons of wheat. If repeated annually, this research may reduce the risk of harvest losses and allow the state to adopt prompt regulation measures to obtain high-quality products, thus increasing the domestic consumption and export potential. © 2024 Kemerovo State University.

To meet this demand, robust analytical methods are essential for confirming the presence and determining active substance concentrations in PPP. This study introduces an analytical method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) for determination of acetamiprid in water-soluble powder formulations. The method, validated according to SANCO/3030/99 rev.5, demonstrated exhibited adequate accuracy and precision, with repeatability expressed as the ratio of the standard deviation (% RSD) to the relative standard deviation (% RSDr) being lower than 1. Recoveries for the active substance at concentrations above 10% ranged from 97% to 103%. The developed method is also characterized by suitable linearity, confirmed by a correlation coefficient >0.99. Specific chromatographic profiles were generated, and acetamiprid content in 180 formulations was analyzed, including reference products. The developed method aligns with ""green chemistry""principles, minimizing solvent use and emphasizing energy efficiency. Overall, it offers a comprehensive approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis, ensuring the reliability of PPP quality control.  © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,378

Researchers of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico) and Switzerland (workshop initiator) held presentations about occurrence and effects of pesticides on the environment, human health, the replacement of highly hazardous pesticides (HHP) by agroecological alternatives and the agri-food value chain. In a subsequent round table discussion, the presenters identified deficits, needs, interests and opportunities. According to them, the lack of awareness of pesticide use affects the health and safety of workers applying the chemicals. Despite Latin America representing the main agricultural area in the world with a very intense pesticide use, monitoring data of pesticides in soil, surface and groundwaters, food, as well as in humans are missing. Risks of pesticides to humans should be assessed so that authorities can withdraw or limit within “short time” the access to corresponding formulations on the market. Also, communication is not state of the art and should be improved as, e.g. the teaching of workers and farmers, how to correctly use and apply pesticides or the briefing of decision makers. Pollinators suffer from multiple stressors not the least due to pesticides, and alternatives are badly needed. On the technical side, the different analytical methods to determine residues of active ingredients and transformation products in matrices of concern should be harmonized among laboratories. Seven future actions and goals were identified to overcome the above deficits. Next steps after the publishing of this conference report are to harmonize and complete the information status of the presenters by exchanging the results/data already present. Therefore, a platform of interaction to address issues described above and to enhance collaboration shall be created. Samples of different matrices shall be exchanged to harmonize the chemical analysis and establish interlaboratory comparisons. Such activities might be facilitated by joining international associations or organizations, where researchers can offer their expertise, or by forming a new pesticide network for Central and South America that could present tailored projects to national and international organizations and funding agencies. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,379

There is a call for development and more widespread use of sustainable alternative weed control measures. Pyrolysis liquid (PL), a by-product of charcoal and biochar production, contains numerous compounds, including organic acids, alcohols, phenols and furans. PL has shown promising results when used against several broad-leaved weeds but its effect on grassy weeds is largely untested. To provide an alternative to synthetic herbicides, PL should be effective and applicable at field scale. In this research, we initially evaluated the potential of birch (Betula sp.) based PL to control mono- and dicotyledonous plants under greenhouse conditions and determined if efficacy is improved by addition of an adjuvant. Second, the efficacy of PL for controlling Elymus repens (L.) Gould was compared with glyphosate and two other synthetic herbicides in a no-tillage system under field conditions. As expected, dicotyledonous plants were more sensitive to acid-based herbicides than monocotyledonous plants. In contrast to our expectations, the herbicidal efficacy of PL was lower than an acetic acid-based herbicide and addition of an adjuvant did not improve efficacy. In conclusion, when used at commercially and practically realistic doses, the efficacy of PL control on monocotyledonous weeds such as E. repens is weak. More product development is needed to improve PL quality and efficacy and to establish practical and cost-effective application levels for weed control on the field scale. © 2023 The Authors.

Miami-Dade County, Florida is part of one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, supports Cx. quinquefasciatus year-round, and recently experienced over 60 human cases of WNV during one outbreak. To facilitate more effective integrated vector management and public health protection, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassay method to evaluate the susceptibility of adult Cx. quinquefasciatus collected from 29 locations throughout Miami-Dade County to pyrethroid and organophosphate adulticide active ingredients (AIs) used by Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control. We also determined the frequency of the 1014 knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation for Cx. quinquefasciatus from a subset of 17 locations. We detected resistance to two pyrethroid AIs in all tested locations (permethrin: 27 locations, deltamethrin: 28 locations). The 1014F allele was widely distributed throughout all 17 locations sampled; however, 29.4% of these locations lacked 1014F homozygotes even though phenotypic pyrethroid resistance was present. Organophosphate resistance was more variable; 20.7% of the locations tested were susceptible to malathion, and 33.3% of the populations were susceptible to naled. We subsequently conducted a field trial of ReMoa Tri, a recently approved multiple AI adulticide formulation labelled for resistant mosquitoes, against a mixed location field population of Miami-Dade Cx. quinquefasciatus. Average 24-hr mortality was 65.1 ± 7.2% and 48-hr mortality increased to 85.3 ± 9.1%, indicating good control of these resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus. This current study shows that insecticide resistance is common in local Cx. quinquefasciatus but effective options are available to maintain control during active disease transmission in Miami-Dade County. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

Systemic fungicides registered for this crop are mainly from the group of quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs), both presenting risks for resistance development. For this reason, sensitivity studies and fungicide efficacy tests are important to determine the levels of sensitivity of isolates from different Colletotrichum spp. from persimmon to fungicides. The objectives of this work were: (i) to investigate the sensitivity of Colletotrichum isolates obtained from persimmon twigs and flowers to registered and non-registered active ingredients; (ii) to evaluate the cross-resistance of Colletotrichum spp. among tested fungicide groups; and (iii) to test the efficacy of fungicides in controlling anthracnose on immature and mature detached fruit. There were differences between Colletotrichum spp. in levels of sensitivity to the active ingredients evaluated, with C. horii isolates being more sensitive to site-specific fungicides than C. chrysophilum, C. nymphaeae and C. melonis. There was a high risk of cross-resistance for the active ingredients of the QoIs, medium risk for the DMIs and multisite compounds, and low risk for the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). Negative cross-resistance correlation was observed for anilopyrimidines (APs). Anthracnose control in immature and mature fruit ex vivo varied between products. In general, isolates recovered from both twigs and flowers were sensitive to the fungicides tested. The SDHI fungicides were efficient in controlling Colletotrichum in the in vitro assay, appearing as an alternative to be tested in the control of the disease. Difenoconazole-based fungicides and mixed formulations of QoI and DMI were the most effective for controlling persimmon anthracnose both for immature and mature fruit. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Sociedade Brasileira de Fitopatologia 2023.",NA,382

In this study, key metabolites with insecticidal activity against H. cunea were screened by targeted metabolomics in Tilia amurensis, a low-preference host plant. Subsequently, the potential of key metabolites that could be used as botanical pesticides was evaluated. The results showed that coumarin was the key insecticidal metabolite of T. amurensis and had a significant insecticidal effect and weight inhibition effect on H. cunea larvae. Coumarin treatment significantly decreased the larval nutrient content and the gene expression of rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle. A significantly enhanced detoxification enzyme activity (CarE and GST), antioxidant oxidase activity (SOD and CAT), non-enzymatic antioxidant levels (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity were observed in coumarin-treated larvae. Coumarin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression levels of detoxification enzyme genes (CarE1, CarE2, CarE3, GST2, and GST3) and antioxidant oxidase genes (SOD1, CAT1, and CAT2) in H. cunea larvae. Coumarin treatment significantly increased the levels of MDA and H2O2 in larvae but did not cause pathological changes in the ultrastructure of the larval midgut. Coumarin solution sprayed directly or as a microcapsule suspension formulation with coumarin as the active ingredient had significant insecticidal activity against the H. cunea larvae. Overall, coumarin, a key anti-insect metabolite identified from T. amurensis, can significantly inhibit the growth and survival of H. cunea larvae and has the potential to be developed as a botanical pesticide. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,383

The cultivation of crops with this method is especially necessary in those countries where the soil or climate is not favorable for the cultivation of similar crops, such as the Republic of Armenia. Soybeans are a great source of protein, dietary fiber, and biologically active substances. Objective: The aim of the study is to obtain flour from domestic soybeans grown using the hydroponic method and use it in confectionery products as a functional additive. Methods: In food analysis, the concept of ""protein"" often refers to the amount of total nitrogen determined by the Kjeldahl method. The method consists of 3 stages: Dissolution, Steam distillation, titration. In addition, the study used modern methods for determining humidity, wettability, amino acid composition with the using of new equipment. Results: When developing the waffle recipe, the primary task was to avoid using any alternative improvers typically used to ensure quality and stability. The technological parameters have been developed according to this principle, so that a high-quality product can be obtained without using food additives that are typically used to obtain traditional products. Conclusion: The article evaluates the amino acid composition of hydroponically and locally produced soybean flour, which was compared with the amino acid composition of other raw materials used in confectionery. The scientific and experimental results can be implemented in the domestic production market, contributing to the food chain in three directions of development: hydroponic soybean cultivation, new device production, and the release of a new type of waffle product.

The current research explores the use and effectiveness of the microbial biopesticide–Lysinibacillus sphaericus against banana pseudostem weevils in field and laboratory conditions. The LC50 value of L.sphaericus was found to be 9.92% of 1 OD (optical density at 600 nm) culture after 24 h of treatment against grubs at in-vitro conditions. L.sphaericus cultures were formulated as liquid, solid, and capsule formulations, and analysed parameters such as viability, shelf life, and pest control efficiency against banana pseudostem weevils. The capsule-based formulation (8 ± 2 × 102a CFU/ml) was most effective against the grubs with a storage period of 120 days to six months under room temperature in air-free containers. The efficacy of a capsule-based formulation at in vivo conditions in the pseudostem revealed that the gelatine coat of the capsule disintegrated within 24hrs after application, leading to the easy release of active ingredients to the pseudostem. The field evaluation observed that in L.sphaericus-based capsule formulations treated plants, there was more than an 80% reduction in the infestation of grubs over control treatments. The current paper describes the application of L.sphaericus against the weevil, its unique formulation as a capsule increasing bacterial shelf life, and ease of application. The development of an easily applicable and effective capsule with a better shelf life of 6 months would increase the marketing possibilities of this biopesticide formulation against Odoiporus longicollis. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,387

While safeners are typically structurally similar to their co-formulated herbicides, they are classified as ""inert"" in the United States, meaning they are not held to the same regulatory standards as the herbicides. This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment. Regulatory agencies should consider reclassifying safeners as active ingredients to ensure adequate toxicity testing and risk assessment. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,388

Analytical methods for measuring ANT-A during pesticide treatments have been done using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) paired with multiple detection methods (for example, electrochemical, ultraviolet, fluorescence, mass spectrometry). However, instruments and analytical chemistry methods can advance over time because of the need to develop timely, reliable, cost effective, and reproducible methods. Subsequently, ANT-A analytical chemistry methods and sample processing techniques also have improved over the past several decades. In the present study, we describe a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method and its verification across three analysts. Each analyst group created a single calibration curve and verified ANT-A in a liquid formulation using the averaged total response of all major ANT-A homologs (A1, A3, A3, A4). The advantage of this technique is that it creates a more resilient ANT-A quantification method amendable to batch-batch differences in major homologs.

We modeled population-level exposures and assessed noncancer hazards to DEET, piperonyl butoxide, prometon, secbumeton, terbumeton, and spinosyn A using nationally representative estimates of kale consumption across life stages in the US. Our findings indicate even sensitive populations (e.g., pregnant women and children) are not likely to experience hazards from these select compounds were they to consume kale from this study. However, a strictly nontargeted chemical analytical approach identified a total of 1,822 features across all samples, and principal component analysis revealed that the kale chemical composition may have been impacted by agricultural growing practices and environmental factors. Confidence level 2 compounds that were ≥5 times more abundant in the urban samples than in rural samples (p < 0.05) included chemicals categorized as “flavoring and nutrients” and “surfactants” in the EPA’s Chemicals and Products Database. Using the US-EPA’s Cheminformatics Hazard Module, we identified that many of the nontarget compounds have predicted toxicity scores of “very high” for several end points related to human health. These aspects would have been overlooked using traditional targeted analysis methods, although more information is needed to ascertain whether the compounds identified through nontargeted analysis are of environmental or human health concern.

As a result, the field of synergistic pharmacology, which includes polyherbal medicines, has become the preferred method for discovering new phar-maceuticals. This study aims to standardize a polyherbal antidiabetic formulation by combin-ing Costus pictus, Gymnema slyvestre, and Momordica charantia via synergism to enhance the bioavailability of the active compounds, reduce the toxicity and promote therapeutic effects of the selected herbs for antidiabetic activity. The formulation was standardized by evaluating its physical characteristics, powder characteristics, physicochemical properties, phytochemical properties, chromatographic analysis, fluorescence analysis, and safety pa-rameters concerning toxins, microbes, and residues. The loss on drying was 8%, which was within the prescribed limits, indicating that the product has a long storage life. Inorganic me-tallic salts, such as silica and phosphates, are negligible in the powder, as indicated by its ash value (7.51%), acid-insoluble ash (1.07%), water-soluble ash (2.97%), and sulphated ash (7.76%). The extractive value of water was the highest (12.66%), compared to alcohol (3.54%) and ether (3.34%). The polyherbal formulation was acidic with pH of 6.5 and 6.0 in 1% and 10% solution, respectively, which minimizes the possibility of microbial contamination. The phytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, glycosides, tannins, and diterpenes. Based on the safety evaluation results, the formulation is safe to consume and free of heavy metal contamination, microbial load, pesticide residue, and aflatoxin. The established metrics are sufficient for assessing polyherbal formulation and can be used as reference standards for quality control and assurance. The lack of standardization studies has hampered the transla-tion of new drug candidates into commercially viable therapies, so standardized alternatives are imperative for determining safety, efficacy, and reliability. © 2023, Association of Biotechnology and Pharmacy.

(Zingiberales: Zingiberaceae) leaf and rhizome essential oils were evaluated for their toxicity and repellency against invasive fire ants: red imported fire ants (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta Buren, black imported fire ants (BIFA), Solenopsis richteri Forel, and a reproductively functional hybrid (HIFA). Ar-turmerone was the major constituent of leaf (42.4%) and rhizome (40.4%) essential oils. A range of concentrations starting from 156 µg/g until the failure of treatment were used. Removal of treated sand in digging bioassay was used as a criterion for repellency. Leaf essential oil showed significantly higher repellency at concentrations of 19.5, 9.8, and 4.9 µg/g against RIFA, BIFA, and HIFA workers, respectively, as compared with control whereas rhizome essential oil was active at 39, 19.5, and 4.9 µg/g against BIFA, RIFA, and HIFA, respectively. Ar-turmerone exhibited repellency at 19.5 µg/g against HIFA workers whereas DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) failed at 39 µg/g. Leaf essential oil showed LC50 values of 85.8, 97.7, and 182.7µg/g against RIFA, BIFA and HIFA workers, whereas the rhizome essential oil had LC50 values of 127, 109.9, and 151.2 µg/g against these species, respectively. Ar-turmerone, tested only against HIFA, with LC50 value of 57.2 was the most active compound. Bifenthrin, a commonly used pyrethroid, with LC50 of 0.03, 0.32, and 0.018 µg/g was toxic against RIFA, BIFA, and HIFA workers, respectively. Both the essential oils and ar-turmerone showed toxicity and repellency against imported fire ants.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay. Methodology/Principal findings Using standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifi-cally enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evalu-ate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. © 2023 Ashu et al.",NA,394

The electrode modified with NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase and the electropolymerized layer synergistically catalyzed the oxidation of the coenzyme (NADH) and fuel (HCOO-) to achieve efficient electron transfer. Further, the replacement of carbon nanotubes with water-dispersible sucrose-derived carbon used as the electrode base allowed the fabrication of a surfactant-free bioanode delivering a maximum current density of 1.96 mA cm-2 in the fuel solution. Finally, a separator- and surfactant-free HCOO-/O2 biofuel cell featuring the above bioanode and a gas-diffusion biocathode modified with bilirubin oxidase and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) was fabricated, delivering a maximum power density of 70 μW cm-2 (at 0.24 V) and an open-circuit voltage of 0.59 V.

Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates; however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of statements on pesticide labels similarly diverge from published studies. We compiled 50 studies on residual toxicity trials with formulated pesticides and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to the EPA. Next, we compared our values and the EPA’s values to the statements on 155 EPA registered pesticide product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under the EPA’s RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants.

Undeniably, novel chemicals derived from the discovery of new compound structures and their biological activities have been synthesized worldwide. Moreover, traditional and rapidly acting chemical pesticides are being scrutinized for their adverse effects on the environment, primarily stemming from resistance development, residue issues, and harmful impacts on beneficial microorganisms. However, stricter legislation and regulations to reduce the wider use of chemically synthesized pesticides have increased the need and significance of ecofriendly pesticides, which have been an emerging trend to control insect pests. The challenges have imposed developments in the application of a group of biopesticides, specifically to help plant defense mechanisms and mortify pests. Nanotechnology with modern formulations is an advanced approach to increasing the efficacy of biopesticides. The eco-friendly use of bioagents like microbes has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient approach for synthesizing nanoparticles through green synthesis methods.

Amisulbrom, a quinone inside inhibitor (QiI), was evaluated for its effectiveness in clubroot management in Alberta, Canada. Resting spores of P. brassicae were treated in vitro with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10% (w/v) amisulbrom to determine its effect on spore germination and viability. Amisulbrom inhibited resting spore germination by up to 79% and reduced viable spores by 31% relative to the control. Applications of a liquid solution (AL1000, 1000 g active ingredient (ai) ha−1) and granular formulations (AF700, 700 g ai ha−1; AF1000, 1000 g ai ha−1; AF1500, 1500 g ai ha−1) of amisulbrom were tested on the canola cultivars ‘45H31’ (clubroot-susceptible) and ‘CS2000’ (moderately resistant) under greenhouse conditions and in field experiments in 2019 and 2020. In the greenhouse, the treatments were evaluated at inoculum concentrations of 1 × 105 or 1 × 107 resting spores g−1 soil. A trend of decreasing clubroot severity with an increasing amisulbrom rate was observed. At the lower spore concentration, treatment with AF1500 resulted in a clubroot disease severity index (DSI) <20% for both cultivars, while the lowest DSI under both low and high spore concentrations was obtained with AL1000. The field results indicated a significant reduction in DSI, with varied effects of rates and liquid vs. granular formulations. The greatest reductions (up to 58.3%) in DSI were obtained with AF1500 and AL1000 in 2020. These findings suggest that amisulbrom holds promise as part of an integrated clubroot management approach. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,398

Registration by the Environmental Protection Agency of products to kill host-seeking ticks or repel ticks contacting humans is indicative of their safety and effectiveness. Unregulated minimum risk products, exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration and often based on botanical oils, are proliferating in the marketplace, but there is concern about their effectiveness to kill and repel ticks. Evaluations of such products are limited in the published literature. A review showed considerable variability among minimum risk products to kill host-seeking blacklegged ticks, with effectiveness similar to chemical pesticide products for some minimum risk products but minimal impact on the ticks for other products. Evaluations of minimum risk tick repellents have typically focused on individual active ingredients rather than formulated products, which often combine multiple active ingredients.

Consequently, there is an urgent inevitability to develop pragmatic techniques for bioremediation, accompanied by the potency of detoxifying soil environments completely. The bioremediation of contaminated soils has been shown to be an alternative that could be an economically viable way to restore polluted soil. The soil environments have long been extremely polluted by a number of contaminants, like agrochemicals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, emerging pollutants, etc. In order to achieve a quick remediation overcoming several difficulties the utility of biosurfactants became an excellent advancement and that is why, nowadays, the biosurfactant mediated recovery of soil is a focus of interest to the researcher of the environmental science field specifically. This review provides an outline of the present scenario of soil bioremediation by employing a microbial biosurfactant. In addition to this, a brief account of the pollutants is highlighted along with how they contaminate the soil.

In this study, glutathione (GSH)/pH dual stimuli-responsive and chlorantraniliprole (CHL)/spinosad (SPI) double-loaded nanoformulations (DMSNs-CHL-polyethyleneimine (PEI)-SPI) are designed to manage Spodoptera frugiperda. The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs)-based DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI exhibit a high insecticide loading content (52.03%), strong corn leave adhesion (87.63%), and enhanced insecticide release behaviors (94.53% for CHL and 57.05% for SPI at 144 h) in response to GSH and alkaline conditions. DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI can effectively enhance the utilization efficiency of insecticides for the dual stimuli-responsive. Bioactivity tests showed that the corn leaves sprayed with DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI possess higher toxicity to Spodoptera frugiperda than physical mixture and single-loaded nanoformulations with the same amount of active ingredients. DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI also possesses a long-term control efficacy, with ∼ 20% pest mortality on corn leaves at 21 d after spraying. In fields, two or more insecticides are usually used to control one insect pest, instead of a single active ingredient. That means the double-loaded insecticide nanoformulation is a practical tool for developing novel insecticide formulations. These results reveal that the dual stimuli-responsive and double-loaded insecticidal nanoformulations are highly promising for sustainable management of insect pests. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,401

One of the current major growing environmental problems is the noticeable amount of these EPs that are present in domestic, municipal, and industrial wastewaters treated by conventional wastewater treatment methods. They are released continuously into the environment due to increasing demand for chemical-based products. However, a majority of the EPs are not controlled or monitored by national or international legislation. Even worse, they can cause direct or indirect harm to human beings and the surrounding ecosystem even at low concentrations. This chapter reviews the concept and applications of conventional wastewater treatment methods to remove EPs in order to understand their limitations. A particular focus is given to filtration, sedimentation, coagulation/flocculation, and activated sludge. Although these conventional methods are intended for removing particles in suspension and colloidal form, organic substances in dissolved state, essential nutrients, and pathogens from wastewater, EPs eventually could also be removed depending on their persistence, physical and chemical properties, treatment methods used, and operational and environmental conditions involved. The most significant groups of EPs that could potentially be removed by the conventional methods are also described. Since these conventional methods cannot guarantee the complete removal of various EPs, it is necessary to study suitable long-term and effective alternatives in the treatment technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

Despite this, little is known regarding the effects of trisiloxane surfactants on important aspects of colony health, such as reproduction. In the present study, we use laboratory assays to examine how exposure to field-relevant concentrations of three trisiloxane surfactants found in commonly used adjuvant formulations affect queen oviposition rates, worker interactions with the queen, and worker susceptibility to endogenous viral pathogens. Trisiloxane surfactants were administered at 5 mg/kg in pollen supplement diet for 14 days. No effects on worker behavior or physiology could be detected, but our results demonstrate that hydroxy-capped trisiloxane surfactants can negatively affect queen oviposition and methyl-capped trisiloxane surfactants cause increased replication of Deformed Wing Virus in workers, suggesting that trisiloxane surfactant use while honey bees are foraging may negatively impact colony longevity and growth.

However, we know little about how the effects of glyphosate AIs differ from those of GBHs that also contain so-called inert co-formulants. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using the model cover crop white mustard (Sinapis alba) to investigate the effects of three GBHs (Roundup PowerFlex, Roundup LB Plus, and Touchdown Quattro) and their respective glyphosate AIs (glyphosate potassium, isopropylamine, and diammonium salt) on epedaphic springtails (Sminthurinus niger; Collembola) activity in soils with low (3.0%) or high (4.1%) organic matter content (SOM). Springtail activity was assessed using pitfall traps. Most GBHs and AIs reduced springtail activity compared to mechanical removal of mustard in the short-term and even up to 5 months after application. GBHs and AIs differed considerably in their effects on springtail activity, and effects were modified by SOM content. Our results highlight the need to (i) distinguish between the effects of glyphosate AIs and commercial GBH formulations, (ii) disclose all ingredients of GBHs, as co-formulants also affect non-target organisms, and (iii) include soil properties in ecotoxicological risk assessments for soil organisms to better characterize the situation in the field. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,404

To enhance the efficacy of the active ingredient, GBHs used in practice often contain other ingredients marked as inert “adjuvants” or “co-formulants”, the toxic properties of which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of pure glyphosate, three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) and two co-formulants commonly used in GBHs as assessed via CCK-8 assay, and the extent of their potential oxidative damage as assessed via superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, in order to reveal the role of adjuvants in the toxicity of the formulations. Our results showed that glyphosate alone did not significantly affect cell viability. In contrast, GBHs and adjuvants induced a pronounced cytotoxic effect from a concentration of 100 μM. SOD activity of cells treated with GBHs or adjuvants was significantly lower compared to cells treated with glyphosate alone. This suggests that the adjuvants in GBHs are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the formulations through the induction of oxidative stress. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,406

The objective of this study is to investigate the role of a common non-ionic surfactant, alkylphenol ethoxylate (APEO), on the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) analysis of pesticides as well as its impact on pesticide persistence on apple surfaces, as a model fresh produce surface. The wetted areas of two AIs (thiabendazole and phosmet) mixed with APEO were determined respectively to correct the unit concentration applied on apple surfaces for a fair comparison. SERS with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) mirror substrates was applied to measure the signal intensity of AIs with and without APEO on apple surfaces after a short-term (45 min) and a long-term (5 days) exposure. The limit of detection (LOD) of thiabendazole and phosmet using this SERS-based method were 0.861 ppm and 2.883 ppm, respectively. The result showed that APEO decreased the SERS signal for non-systemic phosmet, while increased SERS intensity of systemic thiabendazole on apple surfaces after 45 min pesticide exposure. After 5 days, the SERS intensity of thiabendazole with APEO was higher than thiabendazole alone, and there was no significant difference between phosmet with and without APEO. Possible mechanisms were discussed. Furthermore, a 1% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) washing method was applied to test the impact of APEO on the persistence of the residues on apple surfaces after short-term and long-term exposures. The results indicated that APEO significantly enhanced the persistence of thiabendazole on plant surfaces after a 5-day exposure, while there was no significant impact on phosmet. The information obtained facilitates a better understanding of the impact of the non-ionic surfactant on SERS analysis of pesticide behavior on and in plants and helps further develop the SERS method for studying complex pesticide formulations in plant systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,407

In both studies, a pesticide formulation (TOPAS® EW) containing penconazole was used. The results showed that penconazole was relatively short-lived (<30 days) in horticultural products. The proposed method allowed for the tentative identification and semi-quantification of nine metabolites. In addition, the potential toxicity of these metabolites was evaluated, observing that some of them are even more toxic than penconazole, as triazole lactic acid.

If mites do not come into direct contact with the pesticide solution on leaves, the efficacy cannot be achieved. Controlling the particle size can potentially play a crucial role in the manifestation of efficacy. In this study, high-throughput formulation technology was used to systematically screen a large number of adjuvants to obtain cyetpyrafen formulations. The particle size of the active ingredient in the formulation was measured. By examining the dynamic light scattering and contact angle, we simulated the actual process of the efficacy transmission of cyetpyrafen formulations against Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Our results showed that the activity of cyetpyrafen increases as the particle size decreases, suggesting that reducing the particle size can enhance the coverage and deposition on crop leaves, and further improve the dispersion efficiency and enhance spreading capabilities. Furthermore, controlling the particle size at 160 nm resulted in an LC50 value of 0.2026, which is approximately double than that of the commercial product.

This position changed in 2014, when the US Environmental Protection Agency granted an unrestricted Section 3 registration for tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) strain U2 as a herbicide active ingredient for a commercial bioherbicide (SolviNix LC). It is approved for the control of tropical soda apple (TSA, Solanum viarum), an invasive ‘noxious weed’ in the United States. TSA is a problematic weed in cattle pastures and natural areas in Florida. The TMGMV-U2 product kills TSA consistently, completely, and within a few weeks after its application.

Nevertheless, SLs have found their potential in multiple markets, including agriculture due to their pesticide and plant-growth-promoting effects. In this sense, this study has aimed in evaluating potential SLs-producing Brazilian native strains of Starmerella bombicola isolated from different biomes, considering their potential of assimilating household residual cooking oil (HCO), which represents a renewable feedstock to aid the issues regarding raw material expenditures. The highest SL production (6.2 g/L) was obtained with S. bombicola Y-6419 which was isolated from the Brazilian Cerrado biome. To analyze the viability of using rice bran aqueous hydrolysate (RBH) as an alternative nutrients source, it was implemented a 22 factorial design, thereby, the concentration of HCO (g/L) and the supplementation of RBH (% v/v) were evaluated as manipulated variables; as a response, SL production (g/L) was quantified. The RBH showed promising utilization as an elicitor of SLs production by S. bombicola and the final SL titer comprised 51 g/L, which represents an augmentation of approximately ninefold compared to the medium without RBH. SLs were characterized for their physical–chemical properties and their chemical structures were confirmed by HPLC–MS, TLC, and FTIR. Thus, the utilization of agroindustry byproducts and a renewable lipophilic carbon source exhibited marked potential in the production of biosurfactants by the native S. bombicola strain which enables a step towards the consolidation of the bioprocess in modern biorefineries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,411

The isolates were morphologically and genetically characterized. Molecular fingerprinting indicated that the isolates belonged to the species T. pleuroticola and T. harzianum. In order to identify control measures, changes in temperature, pH, and application of fungicides were tested on the present isolates, using known Trichoderma biocontrol strains as a reference. Fungicide effects on the growth of Pleurotus isolates were also assessed. The optimal growth temperatures were 25 °C for Trichoderma isolates and 28 °C for Pleurotus isolates, and Trichoderma always grew faster than Pleurotus. In particular, a reduction of about 30% was recorded for some of the Trichoderma isolates when comparing the colony growth at 25 and 28 °C. Trichoderma isolates developed well within a wide pH range, with the best growth occurring between pH 5 and 7, whereas Pleurotus preferred more alkaline conditions (pH 8 to 9). Prochloraz and metrafenone were found to inhibit Trichoderma growth with different dose responses that did not affect the growth of Pleurotus spp. In particular, metrafenone was the most effective active ingredient that inhibited the majority of the Trichoderma isolates (1–25% growth reduction). © 2023 by the authors.",NA,412

The reaction was investigated and optimized using solvent-free conditions to selectively produce 3,4-methylenedioxypropiophenone (MDP1P), a key intermediate for the manufacture of active ingredients used in insecticide formulations with a volume of production of roughly 3000 t/y. Interestingly, Aquivion-based catalysts allows to work in mild reaction conditions (i. e. 80 °C), obtaining MDP1P yields as high as 44 % after only 1 h of reaction (selectivity 83 %). A detailed study of the AP reactivity demonstrated its tendency to promote oligomerization reactions that, as confirmed by ex-situ and in-situ FT-ATR analyses, caused the deactivation of the catalyst forming surficial carbonaceous residues. In this context, a fast oxidation of the resin surface organic residues using a diluted HNO3 (or H2O2) solution was proven to be an efficient method to regenerate the catalyst, which can be reused for several reaction cycles. The results obtained in preliminary scale-up tests were basically unaffected by the reaction volume (up to 800 mL), paving the way for possible future applications of the process. © 2023 The Authors.

With the boom of nanotechnologies over the last 20 years, the benefits of using nanosized fertilizers come to the fore over conventional ones, as they can slow the release of nutrients, ensure controlled release of nutrients, and lower doses of active ingredients that are sufficient to achieve comparable or better biological effects than the respective bulk conventional fertilizers. Lower environmental contamination during the application of nanosized fertilizers as well as biofortification of consumable plant organs and grains with some essential nutrients enables the production of safe and healthy food. This chapter presents an up-to-date overview of nanoscale formulations of essential macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Mo, and Ni) as well as nonessential micronutrients (Co, Si, and Se) needed for plants, which are used as fertilizers. Application of nanostructured materials serving as nutrient carriers such as hydroxyapatite and nanoclays, and polymeric materials used for coating of nanosized nutrients, enabling slow and controlled release of nutrients, is discussed as well.

Due to their systemic nature and high solubility, neonicotinoids are frequently recorded in soil, water, untreated plant matter and non-target organisms. Studies have demonstrated their capacity to induce invertebrate mortality, however, very little research has been conducted beyond pollinator exposure, particularly under field conditions. Typically, many neonicotinoids are applied via seed-dressings, reducing their direct contact with pollinators, but offering an unintended soil-exposure pathway. Soil biology underpins many vital functions, from regulating water and gas flow, to maintaining physical soil structure. In this study we investigated the effect of a commercial neonicotinoid pesticide (Insyst®) on the abundance, richness, and composition of both the mesofaunal and microbial communities and associated metabolome during oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) production. Our results showed that over a single growing season, foliar application of Insyst® (250 g ha−1, 50 g ha−1 of the active ingredient, acetamiprid) had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the measured soil biological indexes. Seasonal variation was a significantly greater driver in regulating biological communities within the soil than Insyst® application. In addition, we showed that the active ingredient (acetamiprid) was rapidly degraded by the soil microbial community (theoretical half-life = 119 days) during the summer cropping season. These results help highlight the need for realistic field studies, as agricultural pesticides are never pure, often containing surfactants, adjuvants, or emulsifiers which alter their behaviour and ecotoxicity. Understanding the biological interactions of vital soil fauna with necessary pesticide usage will enable proper risk alleviation measures to maintain soil biological and ecological health. © 2023 The Authors",NA,416

The experiments were conducted at three different locations with multiple replications. As a control, a commercial preparation containing Lambda-Cyhalothrin as the active ingredient was used. The obtained results from the study revealed that the application of the bioagent formulation led to a significant decrease in the density of Tetranychus spp. at different biological stages, ranging from 59.22% to 61.07%, when compared to the control group. Additionally, several important plant growth parameters showed remarkable improvements. The number of fruit branches increased by 130.20%, plant crown diameter by 88.16%, plant height by 40.15%, the number of flowers by 21.25%, the number of wood branches by 18.13%, the average number of cocoons by 126.53%, and cocoon weights by 54.65% significantly across all three trial parcels. The successful implementation of the bacterial application for pest control had a positive impact on cotton yield. Bulk cotton yield increased by 80.03%, and fiber yield increased by 82.17%. Consequently, the bacterial formulation containing these two bacteria demonstrated its potential as a biopesticide in cotton cultivation, effectively controlling pests while also playing a crucial role in enhancing productivity. Overall, the study suggests that using the bioagent formulation consisting of Bacillus subtilis PA1 and Paenibacillus azotofixans PA2 could be an effective and environmentally friendly approach for pest control in cotton farming, leading to increased productivity. © 2023, Centenary University.

A key factor for success is the selection of appropriate formulation and delivery systems for each target weed and cropping/climatic region. For dry inoculum products, we discuss direct implantation as an example for successful control of woody weeds, with benefits in control extending beyond the treated weeds to surrounding weeds. These applications do not require water and will become less labor-intensive with future robotic application platforms. Indeed, all bioherbicide applications are likely to improve and become more cost-effective with the advance of new application platforms with sensors and targeted control at lower application volume rates. Unmanned aerial vehicles, as new application platforms, are one of several such potential progressive application systems for liquid formulations, and we discuss product design to maintain optimum conditioning of the active ingredient(s) and storage stability. The delivery system must not adversely affect the products and the application volume rate must be appropriate for coverage on the target. Where applied with other products, compatibility must be ensured and appropriate mixing orders observed to assure performance and avoid precipitation or settling. Droplet size is important for allowing the active materials to be included in the spray, which may require droplets with diameter >150 μm for some larger particle biologically active agents. However, droplet size should not be too large to achieve target coverage. In some cases, that may be plant stems rather than leaves, or narrow grass weeds which tend to have highest spray collection efficiency for small droplets. Narrow droplet size spectrum nozzles may help optimize droplet size. We propose spray calculators to help optimize performance for coverage, retention and avoidance of drift losses, bounce, shatter and runoff. These include regulatory-supported, validated models. © 2023 The Authors. Pest Management Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 The Authors.

Self-assembly nanotechnology is a promising strategy by which to develop novel nano-formulations for pesticides. Nano-formulations improve the effective utilization of pesticides and reduce risks to the environment because of their eco-friendly preparation, high drug loading, and desirable physicochemical properties. Here, to enhance the utilization efficiency of myclobutanil (MYC) and develop a novel nano-formulation, carrier-free co-assembled nanoparticles (MT NPs) based on MYC and tannic acid (TA) were prepared by noncovalent molecular interactions using a green preparation process without any additives. Results: The results showed that the prepared spherical nanoparticles had good stability in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions, low surface tension (40.53 mN m−1), high rainfastness, and good maximum retention values on plant leaves. Release of active ingredients from MT NPs could be regulated by altering the molar ratio of subassemblies in the co-assembly and the pH of the environment. Antifungal experiments demonstrated that MT NPs had better activities against Alternaria alternata and Fusarium graminearum [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 6.40 and 77.08 mg/L] compared with free MYC (EC50 = 11.46 and 124.82 mg/L), TA (EC50 = 251.19 and 503.81 mg/L), and an MYC + TA mixture (EC50 = 9.62 and 136.21 mg/L). These results suggested that MYC and TA incorporated in the co-assembled nanoparticles had a synergistic antifungal activity. The results of a genotoxicity assessment indicated that MT NPs could reduce the genotoxicity of MYC to plant cells. Conclusion: Co-assembled MT NPs with synergistic antifungal activity have outstanding potential for the management of plant diseases. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,419

It is considered a safer alternative to chemical plant protection, with reduced risks to human health and the environment. The significance of biological plant protection has been on the rise, driven by the European Union’s mandate to decrease the reliance on chemical pesticides, the discontinuation of certain chemical active substances, and their limited availability. Microbiological plant protection products find application in organic farming systems. Among these, mycoinsecticides are prominent examples, utilizing insecticidal fungi such as Beauveria bassiana, Cordyceps fumosoroseus, C. farinosa, and Metarhizium anisopliae complex. Due to the high sensitivity of these organisms to unfavorable weather and environmental conditions, their use in the protection of field crops may not bring the desired effect. The enhancement of their efficacy may be accomplished through the use of adjuvants. Adjuvants are substances incorporated into plant protection products, including microbial insecticides, or used alone to enhance their effectiveness. They can play a pivotal role in improving the performance of mycoinsecticides by ensuring better coverage on plant surfaces and increasing the likelihood of successful pest control, thereby contributing to the overall success of biological methods of pest control. Consequently, it becomes imperative to investigate the impact of various adjuvants on the survival and effectiveness of microorganisms. Furthermore, there is no officially approved list of adjuvants for use in organic farming, the use of inadequate adjuvant may result in failure to obtain an organic certificate. The origin of adjuvants determines their classification, which significantly impacts for employment in organic farming practices.

As such, it is a property that is routinely measured during the development of new active ingredients and their formulations. To make these measurements, compounds are typically exposed to simulated sunlight after application to a glass substrate. While useful, these measurements neglect key factors that influence photostability under true field conditions. Most importantly, they neglect the fact that compounds are applied to living plant tissue, and that uptake and movement within this tissue provides a mechanism to protect compounds from photodegradation. RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a new photostability assay incorporating leaf tissue as a substrate, designed to run at medium throughput under standardized laboratory conditions. Using three test cases, we demonstrate that our leaf-disc-based assays provides quantitatively different photochemical loss profiles to an assay employing a glass substrate. And we also demonstrate that these different loss profiles are intimately linked to the physical properties of the compounds, the effect that those properties have on foliar uptake and, thereby, the availability of the active ingredient on the leaf surface. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented provides a quick and simple measure of the interplay between abiotic loss processes and foliar uptake, supplying additional information to facilitate the interpretation of biological efficacy data. The comparison of loss between glass slides and leaves also provides a better understanding of when intrinsic photodegradation is likely to be a good model for a compound's behaviour under field conditions. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,421

In addition, the effect of accelerated storage at 54 2oC for 14 days under laboratory conditions and the degradation rate of metribuzin for test samples were evaluated. The metribuzin content and degradation products were determined using GC–FID and GC–MS. Results indicated that direct sunlight and high temperatures were more effective than ultraviolet rays in accelerating the rate of metribuzin degradation. In contrast, the degradation rate of metribuzin was faster in acidic and alkaline pH than in neutral medium. The formulations of metribuzin are stable after accelerated storage at 54 2oC. There were no discernible differences in metribuzin content before and after 14 days of storage. Metribuzin formulation in SC was more stable than metribuzin in formulation WG and WP, but overall, formulation type had a limited effect on the metribuzin degradation rate.

Within this context, arginine-based tensioactives have gained particular interest, since their cationic nature—in combination with their amphiphilic character—enables them to act as broad-spectrum biocides. This capability is based mainly on their interactive affinity for the microbial envelope that alters the latter’s structure and ultimately its function. In the work reported here, we investigated the efficiency of N α-benzoyl arginine decyl- and dodecylamide against Candida spp. to further our understanding of the antifungal mechanism involved. For the assays, both a Candida albicans and a Candida tropicalis clinical isolates along with a C. albicans–collection strain were used as references. As expected, both arginine-based compounds proved to be effective against the strains tested through inhibiting both the planktonic and the sessile growth. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy techniques and lipid monolayer experiments enabled us to gain insight into the effect of the surfactant on the cellular envelope. The results demonstrated that all the yeasts treated exhibited changes in their exomorphologic structure, with respect to alterations in both roughness and stiffness, relative to the nontreated ones. This finding—in addition to the amphiphiles’ proven ability to insert themselves within this model fungal membrane—could explain the changes in the yeast-membrane permeability that could be linked to viability loss and mixed-vesicle release. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",NA,426

Currently, there is little evidence they do, but that could just reflect lack of clinical investigation. Consequently, it is necessary to carry out a safety evaluation process, quantifying risks so that they can be properly managed. A workshop on this topic in 2022 discussed how best to undertake quantitative risk assessment (QRA) for pesticide products, including learning from the experience of industries, notably cosmetics, that already undertake such a process routinely. It also addressed ways to remedy the matter of clinical investigation, even if only to demonstrate the absence of a problem. Workshop participants concluded that QRA for skin sensitisers in pesticide formulations was possible, but required careful justification of any safety factors applied, as well as improvements to the estimation of skin exposure. The need for regulations to stay abreast of the science was also noted. Ultimately, the success of any risk assessment/management for skin sensitisers must be judged by the clinical picture.

In the present study, test formulations were prepared using plant essential oils and extracts as main active ingredients, and their insecticidal activity and phytotoxicity were examined. Among the combinations tested, two oil-in-water formulations of NRS-13 containing thyme white oil and NRS-24 containing basil and rosemary oils were selected based on their notable insecticidal activity and low phytotoxicity. Chemical analyses on the active essential oils, the quantitative analysis of the major components in the formulations, insecticidal activities under pot and field conditions, their acute toxicity on mammals, and ecotoxicity on fish were also examined. The NRS-13 (BaechooSaferTM) and NRS-24 (JindiOutTM) formulations showed species-specific insecticidal activity against P. xylostella and M. persicae, respectively. In addition, both formulations produced low acute oral and dermal toxicity, skin and eye irritation, and fish toxicities, which suggests those formulations based on essential oils could be considered as insecticides for pest control in small-scale environments in organic farming. © 2023 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",NA,429

While the application of pesticides can improve the quality and yield of crops, plant resistance and the harm caused by pesticide residues to the environment and humans have led to the search for greener and safer pesticide formulations to improve the current situation. In recent years, nanopesticides (NPts) have shown great potential in agriculture due to their high efficiency, low toxicity, targeting, resistance, and controlled slow release demonstrated in the experimental stage. Commonly used approaches to prepare NPts include the use of nanoscale metal materials as active ingredients (AI) (ingredients that can play a role in insecticide, sterilization and weeding) or the construction of carriers based on commonly used pesticides to make them stable in nano-sized form. This paper systematically summarizes the advantages and effects of NPts over conventional pesticides, analyzes the formation and functions of NPts in terms of structure, AI, and additives, and describes the mechanism of action of NPts. Despite the feasibility of NPts use, there is not enough comprehensive research on NPts, which must be supplemented by more experiments in terms of biotoxicology and ecological effects to provide strong support for NPts application. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",NA,431

In this work, we adapt Flash NanoPrecipitation (FNP), a scalable nanocarrier (NC) formulation technology used in the pharmaceutical industry, to prepare organic core-shell NCs and study their efficacy as foliar or root delivery vehicles. NCs ranging in diameter from 55 to 200 nm, with surface zeta potentials from −40 to +40 mV, and with seven different shell material properties were prepared and studied. Shell materials included synthetic polymers poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene glycol), and poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), naturally occurring compounds fish gelatin and soybean lecithin, and semisynthetic hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS). NC cores contained a gadolinium tracer for tracking by mass spectrometry, a fluorescent dye for tracking by confocal microscopy, and model hydrophobic compounds (alpha tocopherol acetate and polystyrene) that could be replaced by agrochemical payloads in subsequent applications. After foliar application onto tomato plants with Silwet L-77 surfactant, internalization efficiencies of up to 85% and NC translocation efficiencies of up to 32% were observed. Significant NC trafficking to the stem and roots suggests a high degree of phloem loading for some of these formulations. Results were corroborated by confocal microscopy and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping. NCs stabilized by cellulosic HPMCAS exhibited the highest degree of translocation, followed by formulations with a significant surface charge. The results from this work indicate that biocompatible materials like HPMCAS are promising agrochemical delivery vehicles in an industrially viable pharmaceutical nanoformulation process (FNP) and shed light on the optimal properties of organic NCs for efficient foliar uptake, translocation, and delivery. © 2023 The Authors.

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called “inert” co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,438

Cinnamaldehyde is found in cinnamon essential oil and has good antifungal activity, but cinnamaldehyde also has negative characteristics such as high volatility, poor water solubility and easy oxidative degradation, which seriously hinder the potential of its antimicrobial properties and its application in agriculture. In this study, the effects of the surfactant ratio, concentration and emulsification method on the stability of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions were systematically investigated by observing the sample appearance, mean droplet size and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results showed that the optimal formula of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsion was a surfactant (R5:848) ratio of 1:1 and a concentration of 7%, and the emulsification method was E1: adding dropwise aqueous phase (deionized water) to the oil phase (cinnamaldehyde + surfactant).

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients.

Besides resistance to post-emergent herbicides becoming increasingly widespread, enhanced metabolism of inhibitors of the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), such as flufenacet, is evolving. Yet, cross-resistance patterns and evolution of this resistance remains poorly understood. RESULTS: The cDNA sequences of five glutathione transferases (GSTs) upregulated in flufenacet resistant black-grass were identified and used for recombinant protein expression. Moderate to slow detoxification of flufenacet was verified for all candidate GSTs expressed in E. coli, and the most active protein produced flufenacet-alcohol instead of a glutathione conjugate, in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH). Moreover, cross-resistance to other VLCFA-inhibitors e.g., acetochlor and pyroxasulfone and the ACCase inhibitor fenoxaprop was verified in vitro. Various other herbicides of different modes of action including VLCFA-inhibitors were not detoxified by the candidate GSTs. CONCLUSIONS: As several in planta upregulated GSTs detoxified flufenacet in vitro, the shift in sensitivity observed in black-grass populations, is likely a result of an additive effect. The polygenic character and the relatively low turnover rate of the individual GSTs may explain the slow evolution of flufenacet resistance. In addition, flufenacet resistance was accompanied by cross-resistance with some, but not all, herbicides of the same mode of action, and furthermore to the ACCase inhibitor fenoxaprop-ethyl. Hence, not only the rotation of herbicide modes of action, but also of individual active ingredients is important for resistance management. © 2023 The Authors.

The complexes were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, TGA/DTA and SEM, TEM. Results indicated that the interlayer distances of OA (DSB)-MMT depended on surfactant content and pH value, while those of DCB (SB)-MMT were only related to the surfactant content. The different thermal decomposition processes of complexes were closely related with pH values. Then the pesticide (lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) or beta-cypermethrin (BCT)) - DCB(SB) micelles were incorporated into the galleries of LCT/DCB-MMT and BCT/SB-MMT hybrids. The basal spaces of LCT/DCB-MMT and BCT/SB-MMT were 4.03 and 4.64 nm, which were larger than those of DCB-MMT and SB-MMT, respectively. The pesticide intercalation was further confirmed by FTIR and TGA/DTA. Furthermore, the release behaviors of BCT (LCT) from the hybrids were compared and analyzed. The pesticide hybrids have the slow release property due to the strong interaction between DCB(SB) and MMT.

To address this concern, environmentally compatible larvicides have become a critical component of integrated mosquito management. However, the number of available larvicides is at a historical low. Currently, larvicides that harness microbials and insect growth regulators account for most products. Screening of new active ingredients (AIs) or improvement of existing AIs is thus necessary to augment the capacity for mosquito control. S-methoprene possesses a similar molecular structure and identical function to mosquito juvenile hormone and has been one of the main targets for research and development. The efficacy and safety of S-methoprene have been well documented since the late 1960s, and numerous products have been commercialized to combat pests of economic importance. However, S-methoprene is vulnerable to environmental factors that lead to its degradation, which has created challenges in formulation development, particularly where extended efficacy is desired. A derivative of S-methoprene, namely S-methobutene, with molecular modification has become available. This derivative has demonstrated an enhanced activity of inhibition of emergence (IE) against species across the Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex genera at IE10, IE50, and IE90. Furthermore, S-methobutene consistently outperformed S-methoprene during a 120-day aging process against the southern house mosquito Cx. quinquefasciatus, where the IE% in S-methobutene was significantly higher than that in S-methoprene on most aging intervals.

Weed control in maize in a split-dose system with a mixture of thiencarbazone-methyl + isoxaflutole at strongly reduced rates with the addition of UAN and the adjuvant Atpolan SoilMaxx or Grounded, and then mesotrione + nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron at strongly reduced rates with UAN and Atpolan SoilMaxx or Actirob 842 EC allowed for great control of weeds. The total amount of substances was slightly higher than in single treatments with adjuvants, but lower than for individual active substances, leading to a reduction in the amount of active substances reaching the environment, while maintaining very high herbicide efficacy. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,448

Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystals and spores as the active substances in commercial biopesticides can also be introduced to vegetable foods and their food processing environment due to pre-harvest treatment of edible crops. The resistance of B. thuringiensis biopesticide spores in comparison to the genetically closely related foodborne B. cereus against heat and UV-C treatment is investigated in this study. The results show that B. thuringiensis biopesticide spores with the commercial granulated product formulation are better protected and as such more resistant to both wet heat (D values at 90 °C: 50.1–79.5 min) and UV-C treatment (D values at 0.6 mW/cm2: 7.5–8.9 min) than the pure spore suspension. The enhanced UV-C resistance properties of B. thuringiensis-formulated spores also indicate that the B. thuringiensis spores in powder or granule formulation applied in the field might not be effectively inactivated by solar radiation (UV-A and UV-B) in a short period. Furthermore, the spores of one emetic B. cereus toxin-producing strain (LFMFP 254; a Belgian outbreak strain) were found more resistant to the wet heat at 90 °C (D90-value = 71.2 min) than other tested pure spore suspensions, although the spores of B. cereus 254 did not show different behavior against UV-C treatment. This result suggests that UV-C treatment can be applied as an effective inactivation method against B. cereus 254 spores. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,449

Concerns have arisen about their potential risk to human, as glyphosate has been detected in human body fluids. Current controversies surround the endocrine-disrupting properties and transgenerational inheritance of diseases and germline epimutations resulting from exposure to GBHs and glyphosate. This review discusses evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on their impact on sex hormone regulation and reproductive system. Evidence suggests that they act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which altering sex hormone levels. Mechanistically, they interfere with hormone signaling pathways by disrupting proteins involved in hormone transport and metabolism. Pathological changes have been observed in male and female reproductive systems, potentially leading to reproductive toxicity. Prenatal exposure may lead to transgenerational inheritance of pathologies and sperm epimutations.

Therefore, we evaluated, in laboratory conditions, the insecticide potential of recommended rates of commercial formulations: organophosphate malathion (10 mg active ingredient - AI/kg), spinosyns bioinsecticide spinosad (1 mg AI/kg) and pyrethroid deltamethrins (0,25 mg AI/kg, with and without the synergist piperonil butoxide – PBO) after 210-, 265-, 310- and 365-days of post-treatment. Testing was performed on two types of beans with kidney- and cranberry-shaped kernels to evaluate the insecticide residual effects on the survival of weevils, progeny production, and related levels of kernels damage. Survival of weevils depends mainly on adults exposure/living period in treated beans and on the recovering period. Small differencies in weevils survival in each insecticide were recorded. We found increases in progeny and thus higher damage in beans, as manifested effects of sublethal doses only in malathion treated bean. In spinosad treated bean we recorded low levels of progeny and damage, below the economic threshold. In deltamethrin treatments, we recorded weevils avoiding contact with beans, no progeny and no damages. The effect of bean type was very low or non existent. It can be concluded that bioinsecticide spinosad can provide long-term protection of common beans against A. obtectus, while organophosphate malathion has low control potential. Pyrethroid deltamethrins residues cause adults to avoid treated beans and no offspring to appear. The obtained results might have significant impact on better understanding of weevils behaviour in the presence of insecticide residues and on the creation of sustainable pest management programmes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,451

This study investigates how pesticide usage and agricultural practices among nursery workers affect their exposure to and potential health risk of pesticides applied over a 2-month period. Ten workers from different nurseries were involved in both personal interview and questionnaire survey to collect data for exposure modelling purposes. On a single spraying day, individuals total daily exposure to single active substances ranged from 0.002 to 0.024 mg kg-bw-1 day-1, mainly constituted of pesticide exposure during application activities (57.3 ""99.9% of total daily exposure). The total daily exposures were assessed against the respective acceptable operator exposure levels (AOELs) for single active substances. Overall, four nursery workers had at least one active substance application that exceeded the AOEL, indicating health risk is possible. While respondents generally worn long sleeves and long pants as the basic protective measures, the exceedances were likely caused by the usage of hazardous active substance (i.e., cypermethrin) and wettable powder formulation, and improper use of gloves.

Atrazine (ATZ) is a triazine herbicide widely used worldwide, and its ecotoxicity to soil microorganisms has been widely studied. However, previous studies have focused on investigating the ecotoxicity of ATZ active ingredients under laboratory conditions. The damage caused by ATZ formulations to soil health in the actual field environment cannot be ignored. Herein, the toxicity of ATZ formulations (1140 and 1710 g hm−2) in maize fields after 1, 28, and 72 d of exposure was investigated in terms of soil microbial abundance, community structure, soil enzyme activities, functional gene abundance, and ATZ residues. The results showed that ATZ disturbed the microbial functions that maintain soil health by disturbing soil nutrient and carbon cycling as well as enhancing pollution degradation. The promotion of both urease activity and AOB-amoA gene abundance indicated that ATZ accelerated the loss of nitrogen from soil, which was detrimental to soil nitrogen cycling. The abundances of the Pontibacter genus and the cbbLG gene were inhibited, indicating that the ability of soil carbon dioxide fixation was hindered. The abundance of Lysobacter, which helps to degrade pollutants, increased. The integrated biomarker response indicated that the comprehensive toxicity of ATZ to soil microorganisms increased with dose. Additionally, the DT50 of ATZ in agricultural soil was 5.4–5.7 d, and the residual level of ATZ in crop grains was in line with the maximum residue limit recommended by the European Union and China. The findings of the present study reflect the effects of ATZ formulation on soil microbes in the actual agricultural environment and provide insights into the mechanisms of soil health regulation mediated by microorganisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,454

The primary aim of adjuvant products is to increase the spreading and sticking of spray droplets and to increase the penetration of active ingredients through the cuticles of leaves or targeted pests, which can reduce the amount of active ingredient needed for effective pest control. Adjuvants are made up of compounds drawn from the ""inert ingredient""list maintained by EPA but are identified as ""principal functioning agents""when used in adjuvant products. These inert compounds do not undergo the same testing and risk assessment process that is required of pesticide active ingredients and generally have no mitigation measures that prevent application onto crops during bloom at times of day when bees are foraging. Honey bees (Apis mellifera;Hymenoptera:Apidae) are at an increased risk of exposure to adjuvant tank mixtures while providing agricultural pollination services. Colony losses attributed to pesticide applications thought to have low risk to honey bees have been reported, highlighting the need to better understand the toxicity of adjuvants included in pesticide tank mixtures. This review summarizes current literature on the risks posed to honey bees by agricultural adjuvants and tank mix combinations of adjuvants with pesticides. Based on the current state of knowledge, we make recommendations to pesticide applicators, product manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and researchers regarding adjuvant toxicity to honey bees with the goal of reducing risks that adjuvants pose to honey bees and other beneficial insects.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Their molecular diversity enables a vast array of essential functions, such as energy storage, immunological signalling, and the modification of food texture and consistency. Due to their rheological characteristics, solubility, sweetness, hygroscopicity, ability to prevent crystallization, flavour encapsulation, and coating capabilities, carbohydrates are useful in food products. Carbohydrates hold potential for the future of therapeutic development due to their important role in sustained drug release, drug targeting, immune antigens, and adjuvants. Bio-based packaging provides an emerging phase of materials that offer biodegradability and biocompatibility, serving as a substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers used as coatings on paper. Blending polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) with carbohydrate biopolymers, such as starch, cellulose, polylactic acid, etc., reduces the undesirable qualities of PHA, such as crystallinity and brittleness, and enhances the PHA's properties in addition to minimizing manufacturing costs. Carbohydrate-based biopolymeric nanoparticles are a viable and cost-effective way to boost agricultural yields, which is crucial for the increasing global population. The use of biopolymeric nanoparticles derived from carbohydrates is a potential and economically viable approach to enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural harvests, which is of utmost importance given the developing global population. The carbohydrate biopolymers may play in plant protection against pathogenic fungi by inhibiting spore germination and mycelial growth, may act as effective elicitors inducing the plant immune system to cope with pathogens. Furthermore, they can be utilised as carriers in controlled-release formulations of agrochemicals or other active ingredients, offering an alternative approach to conventional fungicides. It is expected that this review provides an extensive summary of the application of carbohydrates in the realms of food, pharmaceuticals, and environment. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",NA,456

The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii is a polyphagous pest that can cause large crop yield losses. Here, we tested the effects of three fungicides, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and chlorothalonil, on the fitness and Buchnera endosymbiont of A. gossypii. Results: The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, and the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin produced dose-dependent mortality in A. gossypii, whereas there was no dose-dependent mortality for chlorothalonil. The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin significantly reduced the lifespan and fecundity of A. gossypii, and increased the density of Buchnera in the parental generation but not the (unexposed) F1. When the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin was tested, the lifespan of the F0 generation was also reduced, but the density of Buchnera was not, indicating that non-insecticidal chemicals in the fungicide formulation may affect the density of the endosymbiont of A. gossypii. There was no transgenerational effect of the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin on the lifespan and Buchnera of (unexposed) F1. Conclusions: Our results suggest that formulations of two strobilurin fungicides have immediate impacts on the fitness of A. gossypii, and chemicals in the formulation impact the density of the primary Buchnera endosymbiont.

A new commercial, biological herbicide developed in Kenya is able to control striga effectively. The product was approved for use by the Pest Control Products Board in Kenya in September, 2021. It is self-produced in villages using a secondary inoculum provided by a commercial company. The formulated product has some disadvantages, which are a complicated production process, a very short shelf life and high application rate. Additionally, the product has to be applied manually and therefore can only be used in manual production, leaving out the opportunity for farmers using mechanization. For this reason, efforts have been made to formulate the active ingredient Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. strigae strain DSM 33471, as a powder and to use it as a seed coating agent. This article deals with the production of the Fusarium spore powder, its properties, its application to the seed, and its herbicidal effect demonstrated in the first two field trials. The F. oxysporum strain was originally isolated from a wilting striga plant in Kenya. The strain was virulence enhanced to over produce the amino acids leucine, methionine and tyrosine. These amino acids are responsible for a second mode of action apart from the wilting causing effect of the fungus on striga. Whereas leucine and tyrosine have a herbicidal effect, ethylene from methionine triggers the germination of striga seeds in the soil. Additionally, the strain has been improved to be resistant to the fungicide captan, which is commonly used to treat maize seed in Kenya. Seed coating tests conducted on 25 striga-infested small holder farms spread out in six counties of western Kenya reported yield increases of up to 88%. A second trial carried out by the Kenyan Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization showed a 93% reduction of emerged striga plants. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,458

In the standard, certain pollutants discharge limits are limited strictly or loosely, resulting in practical management implementation difficulties. In view of the highly selective targeting characteristics of organic pesticide active ingredients in fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, a method for deriving discharge limits based on the water quality criteria for pesticides for the protection of nonsensitive species is established based on the idea of fully protecting aquatic organisms beyond sensitive objects. Through the use of malathion as an example, by screening its toxicity data in different species of aquatic organisms, the sequence point with the most significant change in the acute toxicity sensitivity of the species is taken as the variation point in the cumulative frequency of the sensitive and nonsensitive species to derive the water quality criteria, using the species sensitivity distribution method as the scientific basis for determining the discharge limits. After a comparative analysis of different simulation models, the sigmoid model, with the best fit, is selected to determine that the sensitive species hazard concentration (HCs) of malathion to aquatic organisms in China is 46.4 µg/L, and the discharge limit derived from the HCs based on the relationship between the environmental capacity and emissions is rounded to 250 µg/L. Studies showed that the relationship between the emissions limit derived from the water quality criteria for protecting nonsensitive species and malathion limit stipulated in the “Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water” conforms to the corresponding relationship of the quality standard and discharge standard, which can be achieved by current pollution control technology, combined with water quality improvement. The discharge limit offers the advantages of technical accessibility and economic rationality. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",NA,459

The resultant nanoformulations were friendly to the environment and can be an alternative to increase the yiel of agricultural fields. To achieve this, the surface of the halloysite (Hal) was modified by the adsorption of five surfactants (one cationic and four nonionic) to obtain an organophilic organohalloysites (OHal). Adsorption isotherms and FTIR characterization demonstrated that OHal was obtained due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the nonionic surfactants and the Si-OH and Al-OH groups of the Hal, as well as due to cation exchange with the cationic surfactant. The Tbz was encapsulated in the OHal by adsorption. The mass of Tbz adsorbed was 6.73, 2.92, 4.41, 2.19, and 1.86 mg/g for the OHal with Span 20, Span 80, Tween 80, Tween 85, and HDTMA, respectively. This demonstrated that the surfactants with the highest uptake capacity in OHal have the lowest HLB (hydrophilic–lipophilic balance). The release kinetics of Tbz in the OHal occurred rapidly (approximately in 2 days), regardless of the surfactant type. Once encapsulated the Tbz with the alginate, the release time occurred between 5 and 15 days, decreasing the released quantity between 50 and 75%, evidencing a slow release and greater kinetics control. The confrontation of nanoformulations vs. Fusarium spp. delayed the fungus growth, like commercial tebuconazole does, corroborating the antifungal effect of the material, even though the nanopesticide synthesized in this work has 20 times less Tbz. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,460

The majority of formulation consists of an outer medium and a core ingredient, the outer layer progressively degrades over time, enabling the slow release of the active substances to the earth. Bionanocomposites have obtained prominence as outer medium of slow release formulation. Bionanocomposites are a family of hybrid materials made by combining the biopolymer matrix and the nanofiller. Although traditional agrochemicals such as herbicides, insecticides, liming, pesticides, fertilizers etc. are frequently employed in field to improve crop productivity, their excessive use can have noxious effect on the environment and living organisms. These problems can be mitigated by the application of agrochemicals employing bionanocomposites, which increase bio-efficacy and reduces the danger of leaching.

Triatoma infestans (Klug) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is the main vector of Chagas disease in the southern cone of South America. Genetic evidence indicates that T. infestans originated in the Cochabamba region, Sucre, in Central Bolivia, where there are jungle sites of this species, and from which the domestic species is believed to derive, currently distributed in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Chemical control of the vector by spraying dwellings with pyrethroids has been the most widely used strategy to reduce the incidence of this endemic disease. The long-term use of pyrethroid insecticides in T. infestans control campaigns has led to the development of resistance in treated populations. Recently, there has been great interest in the use of botanical products as new alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Essential oils (EOs) seem to be good candidates due to lesser mammalian toxicity and persistence in the environment. In this review, we summarize recent data on toxicity of EOs and their compounds against T. infestans. Recent Findings: A total of 12 research articles from different sources were reviewed and analyzed to compare the effectiveness of the studied EOs and monoterpenes on kissing bugs. The monoterpenes and the EOs reported in the experimental procedures and their effectiveness against T. infestans are described in Table 1. A total of 22 monoterpenes and 46 EOs were reported and distributed in 12 botanical families. Of these, 18 EOs belonged to the following families: Asteraceae, 8; Lamiaceae, 5; Apiaceae, 2; Anacardiaceae, 2; Buddlejaceae, 4; Verbenaceae, 2; and one each to Monimiaceae, Capparaceae, Umbelliferae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae, and Labiatae. The main active components of the EOs responsible for the ovicidal and larvicidal properties on T. infestans were menthyl acetate, L-menthone, L-menthol, isomenthol, piperitone, linalool, pulegone, 1,8-cineole, α,β-thujone, limonene, E-anethol, and E-nerolidol. Moreover, the compounds eugenol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, menthol, α-terpineol, and thymol were the most effective inducing hyperactivity (disordered, erratic, and spasmodic locomotor activity). Reported effectiveness varied widely due to the difference in the evaluation methodology and properties of both EOs and monoterpenes. Some of the advantages of using EOs and monoterpenes are that they have little environmental impact because of their low toxicity to mammals and very low environmental persistence. An important finding was the reported synergism on the hyperactivity and mortality effect between eugenol and permethrin on T. infestans. Summary: In recent years, the toxicity of new essential oils and their compounds on T. infestans was evaluated, as well as combinations of monoterpenes with pyrethroids. The latter is the most promising result since it could be a new tool for monitoring the population dynamic. The findings of this work show that certain EOs and their components have insecticidal and repellent potential for their development as formulations for T. infestans. The production of EO is feasible due to its low cost, availability, and accessibility. It is difficult to compare the reported info from literature due to the wide variety of exposure bioassay techniques and chemical extraction methods of the EOs and their compounds. The synergistic effect between eugenol and permethrin on T. infestans suggests that this combination could be a viable alternative of the flushing-out strategy employed in the national control campaigns. Thus, essential oils and their constituents would contribute to delay the development of insecticide resistance in the populations of T. infestans through the combination of these actives with pyrethroids. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,462

The major part of applied pesticides is lost due to poor retention characteristics, whereas the retention is related to pesticide utilization efficiency. The drift pesticides create substantial environmental contamination and are a primary concern because of their high persistence and toxicity to humans and non-targets. Coupling bio-pesticide and suitable delivery systems to optimize targeting and uptake will enable the design of suitable agrochemicals that combine optimal safety, sustainability, and functionality profiles. We present a strategy to address the issue by taking advantage of oil dispersion (OD) as a delivery system for loading leaf phyto-extract of an indigenous plant (Dalbergia sissoo). The chemical profiling of phyto-extract performed by GC-MS revealed the presence of hydrocarbons, fatty acid methyl esters, and their derivatives, including majorly Glycidyl oleate, Cinnamyl linoleate, whereas LC-MS analysis briefed the presence of compounds; Ferulic acid and a chalcone flavonoid- Isoliquiritigenin. The OD was developed via a two-step process; dispersion followed by wet grinding, which displayed shear-thinning rheological behavior. Upon spraying on leaves, the OD carrier could achieve enhanced wetting and spreading on the foliage. Driven by the additive-based interactions, OD improved pesticide retention and wash resistance, which was evident by the fluorescent labelling of the formulation. The leaf extract-loaded OD possesses a 9-day residual effect and excellent efficacy in controlling Aphids, comparable to synthetic insecticide. Overall, OD-loaded phyto-extract provides an effective strategy for prolonging pesticide retention and reducing pesticide loss in agro-production, both of which are desirable for a cleaner and pollution-free environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,463

Therefore, the minimum concentration of CLT required to inhibit 50 % of growth (MIC50) was determined, obtaining a value of approximately 15 ng/mL. A non-ionic emulsion type 1, Beeler base cream, hydrogel and liposomes containing CLT were designed, prepared, characterized and their antifungal activity against C. albicans was tested. CLT loaded liposomes were small in size (102 nm), homogeneous (polydispersity index = 0.3) and uncharged (+0.07 mV), showing higher antifungal activity against C. albicans than that of the commercially available cream Canesten®. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of CLT was reduced in combination with surfactants such as Tween-80/Span-80 or Brij-S10. Sodium lauryl sulphate showed a fungicidal effect that disappeared when formulated as part of the Beeler base cream. © 2023 The Author(s)",NA,464

The current understanding of potential unintended (eco)toxicological impacts of nano-formulated pesticides is scarce, in particular with regard to (non-target) aquatic organisms and ecosystems. The present study reports the results of a long-term freshwater mesocosm experiment which assessed responses of individual zooplankton taxa and communities to a novel TiO2-coated nano-formulation of the fungicide carbendazim. Population- and community trends were assessed and compared in response to the nano-formulation and its constituents applied individually (i.e. nano-sized TiO2, carbendazim) and in combination (i.e. nano-sized TiO2 & carbendazim). Minimal differences were observed between effects induced by the nano-formulation and its active ingredient (i.e. carbendazim) when applied at equivalent nominal test concentrations (4 μg L−1). Nano-sized TiO2 was found to affect zooplankton community trends when applied separately at environmentally realistic concentrations (20 μg L−1 nominal test concentration). However, when nano-sized TiO2 was applied in combination with carbendazim, nano-sized TiO2 was found not to alter effects on community trends induced by carbendazim. The findings of the current study provide an extensive and timely addition to the current body of work available on non-target impacts of nano-formulated pesticides. © 2023 The Authors",NA,465

The insecticide Actara® (active ingredient thiamethoxam- TMX) is a commercial formulation widely used for the control of various agricultural pest species. However, negative effects of TMX have been observed in non-target organisms. This work aimed to evaluate the biological effects of the commercial formulation Actara® on the aquatic non-target and non-biting larvae of Chironomus xanthus (Diptera). The lethal (LC50) and sublethal (body length, head capsule width, cumulative emergence, and mean time to emergence—EmT50) effects were determined in two subsequent generations (P and F1). The estimated 48 h LC50 for C. xanthus larvae exposed to Actara® was 73.02 µg TMX/L. By looking at the sublethal effects of Actara on the life cycle parameters of C. xanthus, we determined that none of the concentrations used induced a significantly different response in the organisms, compared to the control treatment (NOEC > 2 µg TMX/L). However, the head capsule width in the parental (P) generation exposed to Actara (≥ 0.9 µg TMX/L) was significantly bigger than the head capsule width of control animals. Overall, our results highlight that, at environmentally relevant concentrations, the commercial formulation Actara® is non-toxic to C. xanthus. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",NA,467

They are designed to readily use, mixed and sold. Lack of knowledge of know-how leads to improper handling and use. This led to the development of a resurgence of secondary pests, résistance development, health hazards, and the problem of pesticide residues. All pesticides should be approved by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and must be tested for human health and the environment thoroughly for their safety. The broad-spectrum organochlorine insecticides have the highest persistence and deteriorate the environment; their residues are still detected in nature. The new evolution of pesticides has led to the discovery of new chemical families that are lowly persistent in nature, environment-friendly, have a low use rate of insecticides and fungicides, and 332less harm to beneficial insects, and the chemical patterns make the environmentally safe formulations. Because of the cheaper price, the conventional insecticide formulations are still being used in developing countries like India.

However, the advantages/disadvantages of the combined use of anthelmintics require further scientific characterization. The goals of the current trial were a) to characterize the pharmacokinetics of closantel (CLO) and moxidectin (MXD) administered both subcutaneously (sc) and orally either separately or co-administered (CLO + MXD) to lambs; b) to compare the nematodicidal activity of both molecules given individually or co-administered to lambs infected with resistant nematodes. Seventy (70) Corriedale lambs naturally infected with multiple resistant gastrointestinal nematodes were involved in the pharmacokinetic and efficacy trials. The animals were allocated into six groups (n = 10) and treated with either CLO, MXD, or with the CLO + MXD combined formulation by both the oral and sc routes. Additionally, an untreated control group (n = 10) was included for the efficacy trial. The efficacy was estimated by the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). Higher systemic exposure of both CLO and MXD was observed after the sc compared to the oral administration in lambs. The combined administration of CLO + MXD did not markedly alter their disposition kinetics. At 13 days post-treatment, the administration of both molecules as a single active principle reached efficacy levels ranging between 80% (MXDoral), 84% (CLOoral), 85% (CLOsc), and 92% (MXDsc). The combined oral and sc treatments reached 99% efficacy. No adverse effects were observed after the combined treatment of CLO + MXD, and their co-administration did not show any adverse pharmacokinetic interaction. The combined effect of CLO + MXD successfully restored the maximum efficacy levels, which were not reached by the individual active ingredients. © 2023 The Authors",NA,472

During the CE separation process, UESA-DLLME was used for sample clean-up and offline concentration, and FASI-CE was used for the online concentration of phenothiazine enantiomers. At baseline, the five pairs of phenothiazine enantiomer drugs required 18 min for separation. UESA-DLLME was then used to extract 0.01 mM Tween 80 at pH 10 from a sample solution (extraction solvent, 100 mL of dichloromethane). Subsequently, FASI was used to stack the sample solution (buffer, 30 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid/aspartic acid, additive 4 mM hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin, pH 2.5), and C4D was used for signal detection (amplitude, 2 Vpp; frequency, 400 kHz). The results indicated that the linear range for quantifying all analyte enantiomers was 1.0–150 nM, with a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.99. In addition, the relative standard deviations in the migration time and peak areas for the 10 analytes were less than 3.2% and 7.2%, respectively. The proposed system has a limit of detection (LOD) for the 10 analytes at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, ranging from 0.24 to 0.28 nM. The sensitivity enhancement, which compares the LOD0 (limit of detection in the normal method) to LOD1 (limit of detection achieved using the proposed UESA-DLLME-FASI-CE-C4D method), varies between approximately 1200 and 2000 for the 10 analytes. Analysis of the 10 separated analytes spiked in urine and serum samples revealed recovery rates of 88%–106% and 89%–105%, respectively. Therefore, this highly sensitive advanced technique was successfully used to analyze phenothiazine enantiomers in urine and serum samples. © 2023",NA,473

Many are due to consumption of acutely toxic pesticides; however, there is a lack of national suicide data, limiting knowledge and potential for intervention. In this paper, we aimed to review the literature on pesticide self-poisoning in Pakistan to identify the most problematic pesticides in relation to national pesticide regulations. Methods: Information on the currently registered and banned pesticides was obtained from Ministry of National Food Security and Research while data on pesticide import and use was extracted from FAOSTAT. We searched the following sources for articles and research papers on poisoning in Pakistan: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE (PUBMED), PS102YCHINFO and Pakmedinet.com using the search terms ‘self-poisoning’, ‘deliberate self-harm’, ‘suicide’, ‘methods and means of suicide’, ‘organophosphate’, ‘wheat pill’, ‘aluminium phosphide’, ‘acute poisoning’, OR ‘pesticides’, AND ‘Pakistan’. Results: As of May 2021, 382 pesticide active ingredients (substances) were registered in Pakistan, of which five were WHO hazard class Ia (extremely hazardous) and 17 WHO hazard class Ib (highly hazardous). Twenty-six pesticides, four formulations, and seven non-registered pesticides had been banned, of which two were WHO class Ia and five Ib. We identified 106 hospital-level studies of poisoning conducted in Pakistan, of which 23 did not mention self-poisoning cases and one reported no suicidal poisoning cases. We found no community or forensic medicine studies. Of 52,323 poisoning cases identified in these papers, 24,546 [47%] were due to pesticides. The most commonly identified pesticide classes were organophosphorus (OP) insecticides (13,816 cases, 56%) and the fumigant aluminium phosphide (3 g 56% tablets, often termed ‘wheat pills’; 686 cases, 2.7%). Few studies identified the particular pesticides involved or the resulting case fatality. Conclusion: We found pesticide poisoning to be a major cause of poisoning in Pakistan, with OP insecticides and the fumigant aluminium phosphide the main pesticides identified. Withdrawal of Class I pesticides (as proposed to occur nationally in 2022) and high concentration aluminium phosphide tablets should rapidly reduce suicidal deaths by reducing the case fatality for low-intention poisoning cases. National cause of death data and forensic toxicology laboratory data identifying the pesticides responsible for deaths will be important to assess impacts of the proposed national ban. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,475

The CA NP can emulsify various oils and form stable emulsions at concentrations as low as 0.5 wt %. Rheological and microscopic analyses show evidence of interconnected NP aggregate networks between droplets. Yield stress measurements display evidence of “double” yielding. We postulate that the presence of the NP aggregates provides a secondary network between droplet clusters resulting in such behavior. We demonstrate the suitability of the emulsions as agriculture formulations by incorporating an agrochemical, abamectin (Abm), and a plant-growth-promoting microbe (PGPM) in the emulsions. Release assays exhibit sustained Abm release, promising higher efficacy at lower usage volumes. Incorporation of nonsporulating PGPM Pseudomonas simiae in the emulsions shows significantly higher microbe viability compared to controls after 70 days of storage. By demonstrating the application of CA NPs as a sustainable Pickering emulsifier, this study introduces the use of CA as a platform technology for the delivery of diverse agriculture cargos.

Bioassays 2 and 3 followed the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which specify the LC50 (48 h). In bioassay 4, the LC50 (48 h) and the survival rate of bees for a period of 120 h were determined by contact with a surface contaminated with imidacloprid, and in bioassay 5, the interference of the insecticide with the flight behavior of bees was evaluated. Honey samples were collected in agroecological and conventional georeferenced apiaries and traces of the imidacloprid were detected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) with extraction by SPE C18. Bee survival was directly affected by the concentration and exposure time, as well behavioral performance, demonstrating the residual effect of imidacloprid on A. mellifera workers.

Methods for testing mosquito susceptibility against contact insecticides or products, such as those delivered through public health programmes, are well-established and standardised. Nevertheless, approaches for testing volatile or aerosolized insecticides used in household products can be challenging to implement efficiently. We adapted WHO guidelines for household insecticides to develop a standardised and higher-throughput methodology for testing aerosolized products in a Peet Grady test chamber (PG-chamber) using caged mosquitoes and an efficient decontamination method. The new approach was validated using insecticide resistant and susceptible Aedes and Anopheles mosquito colonies. An added feature is the inclusion of cage-facing cameras to allow real-time quantification of knockdown following insecticide exposure. The wipe-based decontamination method was highly effective for removing pyrethroids' aerosolized oil-based residues from chamber surfaces, with < 2% mortality recorded for susceptible mosquitoes tested directly on the surfaces.

For anisotropic wired superhydrophobic leaf surfaces, the splashing phenomenon is especially serious because it leads to the low effective utilization of pesticides by biological targets. The lost pesticides cause serious ecological environment pollution, therefore there is an urgent need to develop a green and sustainable cost-effective strategy to achieve efficient deposition of high-speed droplets on anisotropic superhydrophobic leaf surfaces at low dosage. Results: One type of green pseudogemini surfactant is constructed based on fatty acids and hexamethylenediamine by electrostatic interaction to control the splashing and spreading of high-speed droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces. The formed surfactant can not only achieve complete inhibition of the bouncing of droplets, but also promote rapid spreading on superhydrophobic leaf surfaces at very low usage. The efficient deposition and superspreading phenomenon are attributed to the rapid migration and adsorption of the surfactant from the dynamic spherical micelles at the newly formed solid–liquid interface, the network-like aggregated spherical micelles, and the Marangoni effect caused by the surface tension gradient. Moreover, the surfactant shows an excellent synergistic effect with herbicides to control weeds by inhibiting droplet splashing. Conclusion: This work provides a simpler, more effective and sustainable approach to utilize aggregated spherical micelles rather than conventional vesicles or wormlike micelles to improve the droplet deposition on superhydrophobic leaf surfaces and reduce the impact of surfactants and pesticides on the ecological environment. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,481

Insecticides have gained a lot of popularity, although there are still concerns about their effects on the environment. Along with this, the rising incidence of insect species developing resistance to many of the insecticides currently in use presents significant issues for agriculture. In order to solve these issues, new approaches to pest management are needed. In order to accomplish these goals, nanotechnology is quickly becoming a highly appealing study area. It offers new techniques for creating innovative active components with nanoscale dimensions. The extensive research on nanoparticles is anticipated to overcome the major drawbacks of current pest control methods and offer new, advanced nano-based formulations that are stable in the environment, penetrate the insect, and preferably have a novel mode of action. Nowadays, biosynthesized nanoparticles are gaining a lot of prominence due to their ecofriendly nature. Therefore, the current chapter focuses on the application of nanoparticles (NPs) to crop protection, with a focus on pest management in both urban and rural areas, along with the numerous types of biologically synthesized NPs that are currently employed for pest management. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024, corrected publication 2024.

The microscopic observations showed morphological variations in the midgut and fat body that indicated a defect in the performance of their functions. The treated larvae showed modifications in the midgut tissues vs the control sections, whereas the epithelial cells seamed without any distinct stratification and had malformed morphology along the midgut. The peritrophic membrane lining loss was evident. The abdominal fat body of the treated larvae appeared in densely spread lobes, accumulating and occupying an enormous portion of the abdominal cavity. Its cellular components were characterized by their large size compared to the untreated ones. The results obtained indicated that the tested mixed insecticide gained its properties from its active ingredients. The findings herein indicated that chronic exposure to the applied insecticide could be considered stressful conditions affecting different aspects of fat body functions needed for late vital activities.

Results indicated that the drag of lindane by liquid flows is not as important as expected, opposite to what happened with the dragging by gaseous flows. The retention of gaseous lindane was also confirmed in adsorption tests carried out in a column packed with cork granules. The addition of surfactant had a very limited effect on the mobility of lindane, and dragging of this species to the electrode wells or to a permeable reactive barrier.

The purpose of this study is to develop an insecticidal packaging film based on pectin and essential oil (EO) extracted from Citrus aurantium (L., 1753) fruit peels.The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and cumulative release (CR) of C. aurantium EO into pectin film were determined. Further, Film packaging was tested against Rhyzopertha dominica adults reared on Karim and Khiar durum wheat (Tritichum durum Desf.) varieties. The fumigant toxicity was assessed after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of storage. Moreover, emergence inhibition of R. dominica adults was determined. In addition, germination rate, weight loss and grain damage were examined. Results revealed that the lethal concentration that killed 50 % of the exposed adults developed into karim and khiar varieties were 278.45 and 688.79 µL/L air, respectively. Moreover, high encapsulation efficiency of C. aurantium essential oil into pectin film with an EE = 80.6 %. Moreover, pectin: EO film achieved complete (100 %) mortality and emergence inhibition of R. dominica adults for all storage periods. Also, pectin: EO film represent the better treatment which preserve the quality and quantity of wheat grains as well as grain damage, weight loss and germination rate. To conclude: pectin- C. aurantium EO film showed a significant fumigant effect against R. dominica adults and the emergence of their descendants after different storage periods and could be recommended as an active ingredient for a natural packaging against stored product insects. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,485

Herein, Alginate-based supra-amphiphiles (SAs), host–guest self-assembled by host amphiphilic cyclodextrin-functionalized alginate derivative (Alg-CD) and guest azobenzene-based surfactant (Azo-DEMA), performed comprehensive characteristics, which integrated the viscosity effect and the ability to reduce surface tension. SAs enabled oil-in-water pesticide droplets to inhibit splashing and light-regulate wetting, thereby enhancing droplets deposition. By analyzing the impact dynamics of loaded-pesticide o/w droplets on hydrophobic surface, the addition of SAs rapidly afforded the pinning ability of droplets with the target surface, and in turn, resulted in inhibiting splashing. Afterward being exposed to UV light, the resulting SAs o/w droplets undergone disassembly so as to release small-molecular surfactant and reduce the surface tension of droplets for improving droplets’ wettability. Importantly, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was skillfully used for revealing the interaction mechanism between droplets and the waxy layer of hydrophobic surface, finding that SAs could form compact conformation on the waxy surface, while disassembled SAs undergoing UV irradiation exhibited the large adsorption amount and stronger interaction with waxy layer. Consequently, the herbicidal activity experiments exhibit sensitive pesticide control effects assessed under UV even natural sunlight. Light-regulating host–guest interfacial interaction of polysaccharide-based supra-amphiphiles may provide a novel, eco-friendly and feasible manner for comprehensive pesticide applications. © 2023",NA,488

This fish species displays predation potential on the aquatic stages of mosquitoes. Bensulfuron-methyl and quinclorac are herbicide active substances that have been extensively applied in rice culture in Egypt and other countries worldwide. This study assessed the adverse effects of sublethal concentration of a commercial herbicide formulation containing quinclorac and bensulfuron-methyl on the predation potential of C. gariepinus female and male predatory fish on Culex pipiens mosquito larvae. Also, stomach and intestine histopathology of the treated fish was investigated. The exposure of C. gariepinus to sublethal concentration of quinclorac and bensulfuron-methyl based herbicide produced detrimental effects on prey consumption and histopathological changes in the stomach and intestine of the fish. The mosquito consumption by the treated female and male fish decreased significantly compared to the untreated fish of both sexes. The histological changes in the intestines were hyperplasia of the intestinal epithelium and goblet cells; edema of lamina propria and broad intestinal villi, and distortion in intestinal villi in comparison to control. The stomach histopathology changes were necrosis and sloughing of mucosal epithelium with severe damage of sub-mucosa. Thus, the tested herbicide at sublethal concentration on C. gariepinus decreased the prey consumption on mosquito larvae and caused histopathological alterations in the fish that may impair its digestive physiology.

The proposed methodology is tested for a model system containing the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) and the copolymer copovidone (PVP/VA) prepared via hot-melt extrusion. For this purpose, reorientational and the viscoelastic structural (α-)relaxation time constants of hot-melt-extruded ASDs were obtained via DS and shear rheology, respectively. These were then utilized to extract the viscosity as well as the fragility index of the dispersions as input parameters to the fractional Stokes-Einstein (F-SE) relation. Furthermore, a modified version of Almond-West (AW) formalism, originally developed to describe charge diffusion in ionic conductors, was exercised on the present model system for the estimation of the AI diffusion coefficients based on shear modulus relaxation times. Our results revealed that, at the calorimetric glass-transition temperature (Tg), the self-diffusion coefficients of the AI in the compositional range from infinite dilution up to 60 wt % IMI content lied in the narrow range of 10-18-10-20 m2 s-1, while the viscosity values of the dispersions at Tg varied between 108 Pa s and 1010 Pa s. In addition, the phase diagram of the IMI-PVP/VA system was determined using the melting point depression method via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the intermolecular interactions within the solid dispersions. In this respect, the findings of a modest variation in melting point at different compositions stayed in agreement with the observations of weak hydrogen bonding interactions between the AI and the polymer. Moreover, IR spectroscopy showed the intermolecular IMI-IMI hydrogen bonding to have been considerably suppressed, as a result of the spatial separation of the AI molecules within the ASDs. In summary, this study provides experimental approaches to study diffusivity in ASDs using DS and oscillatory rheology, in addition to contributing to an enhanced understanding of the interactions and phase behavior in these systems. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,492

This required the introduction of environment- and public health-friendly advanced technologies for plant protection to guard yields from pest destruction in a sustainable way. Encapsulation technology is a promising procedure to increase the effectiveness of pesticide active ingredients while reducing human exposure and environmental impact. Despite the presumed favorable properties of encapsulated pesticide formulations on human health, it is necessary to systematically assess whether they are less harmful to human health than conventional pesticide products. Objectives: We aim to systematically review the literature to answer the question of whether micro- or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulations exert different degrees of toxicity than their conventional (not-encapsulated) counterparts in in vivo animal and in vitro (human, animal, and bacterial cell) non-target models. The answer is important to estimate the possible differences in the toxicological hazards of the two different types of pesticide formulations. Because our extracted data will come from different models, we also aim to perform subgroup analyses to investigate how toxicity varies across different models. A pooled toxicity effect estimate will also be performed by meta-analysis when appropriate. Methods: The systematic review will follow the guidelines developed by the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT). The protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement. PubMed (NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), Embase (Elsevier), and Agricola (EBSCOhost) electronic databases will be comprehensively searched in September 2022 to identify eligible studies using multiple search terms of “pesticide”, “encapsulation” and “toxicity” along with their synonyms and other words that are semantically related. The reference lists of all eligible articles and retrieved reviews will be manually screened to identify additional relevant papers. Eligibility criteria: We will include peer-reviewed experimental (non-target in vivo animal model and in vitro human, animal, and bacterial cell cultures) studies published as full-text articles in English language that simultaneously investigate the effect of any micro- or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulation, applied in all ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure, and its corresponding active ingredient(s) or its conventional non-encapsulated product formulation(s) used in the same ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure on the same pathophysiological outcome. We will exclude studies that examine pesticidal activity on target organisms, cultures of cells isolated from target organisms exposed in vivo or in vitro, and those using biological materials isolated from target organisms/cells. Study appraisal and synthesis: Studies identified by the search will be screened and managed according to the review inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Covidence systematic review tool by two reviewers, who will also blindly extract the data and assess the risk of bias of included studies. The OHAT risk of bias tool will be applied to evaluate the quality and risk of bias in the included studies. Study findings will be synthesized narratively by important features of the study populations, design, exposure, and endpoints.

Surfactants can promote the bioavailability of organic compounds for enhanced microbial degradation, but the performance depends on soil and surfactant properties, sorption-desorption equilibria of contaminants and surfactants, and possible adverse effects of surfactants on microorganisms. This study investigated the influence of five surfactants [e.g., Triton X-100 (TX-100), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA), Aerosol 22 and Tween 80] on the sorption-desorption, degradation, and mobility of CTL and OH-CTL in two volcanic and one non-volcanic soil. Sorption and desorption of fungicides depended on the sorption of surfactants on soils, surfactants' capacity to neutralize the net negative charge of soils, surfactants’ critical micellar concentration, and pH of soils. HDTMA was strongly adsorbed on soils, which shifted the fungicide sorption equilibria by increasing the distribution coefficient (Kd) values. Contrarily, SDS and TX-100 lowered CTL and OH-CTL sorption on soils by decreasing the Kd values, which resulted in an efficient extraction of the fungicide compounds from soil. SDS increased the degradation of CTL, especially in the non-volcanic soil (DT50 values were 14 and 7 days in natural and amended soils, with final residues <7% of the initial dose), whereas TX-100 enabled an early start and sustenance of OH-CTL degradation in all soils. CTL and OH-CTL stimulated soil microbial activities without noticeable deleterious effects of the surfactants. SDS and TX-100 also reduced the vertical transport of OH-CTL in soils. Results of this study could be extended to soils in other regions of the world because the tested soils represent widely different physical, chemical, and biological properties. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,494

Turmeric nanoparticles showed an average particle size of 203 nm, polydispersity index (PI) of 0.322, and zeta potential of-92.7 mV. In the in vitro antifungal bioassay, this nanoformulation significantly inhibited the mycelial growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum orbiculare in a dose-dependent manner. Red pepper anthracnose was also consistently suppressed by turmeric nanoparticles but the tomato anthracnose was resistant to this formulation at 10 mg/mL in vivo. The study results proved the effectiveness of turmeric nanoparticles to control red pepper anthracnose in postharvest preservation and suggested developing the innovative nanoformulation as a green fungicide. © 2023, Publishing House of Natural Science and Technology, VAST.

Essential Oil: Herbicidal, Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activities",2023,Current Applied Science and Technology,23,NA,NA,10.55003/cast.2023.05.23.009,"The chemical composition of wintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens L.) essential oil (WEO) was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and evaluated for its biological activities. Methyl salicylate (100%) was the main compound in the wintergreen essential oil. The herbicidal efficacy of the WEO was confirmed by germination inhibition, radical and shoot length reduction, and phytotoxicity assessment with Echinochloa crus–galli and Amaranthus tricolor seedlings. The WEO significantly reduced the germination and seedling growth of both weeds. It showed highly significant inhibition of seed germination (93.37%) and seedling growth of A. tricolor at the highest dose (6 µL/petri dish) assayed. The WEO was formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (EC-EO) for post-emergence application, and was applied at a range of concentrations from 10 to 80 mL/L. Both treated plant leaves appeared wilted and slightly discolored within 1 day of application (DAA). The visible weed control efficacy was most remarkable at 80 mL/L treatment, which was a level that ultimately killed the seedlings of both species at 3 DAA, suggesting promising herbicidal potential for the WEO. The WEO showed weak scavenging activity with a high IC50 value (IC50 >2×104 and >5×104 ppm) for DPPH scavenging and metal chelating assays, respectively. The WEO showed moderate antibacterial activity, and its zones of inhibition against bacterial test strains were 7.90±0.8 mm and 23.9±0.9 mm for Escherichia coli TISTR 780 and Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, respectively. Therefore, the results suggest the possibility of using WEO as an active ingredient to produce natural herbicides. © 2023, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,500

QAC use has accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the banning of 19 antimicrobials from several personal care products by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016. Studies conducted before and after the onset of the pandemic indicate increased human exposure to QACs. Environmental releases of these chemicals have also increased. Emerging information on adverse environmental and human health impacts of QACs is motivating a reconsideration of the risks and benefits across the life cycle of their production, use, and disposal. This work presents a critical review of the literature and scientific perspective developed by a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team of authors from academia, governmental, and nonprofit organizations. The review evaluates currently available information on the ecological and human health profile of QACs and identifies multiple areas of potential concern. Adverse ecological effects include acute and chronic toxicity to susceptible aquatic organisms, with concentrations of some QACs approaching levels of concern. Suspected or known adverse health outcomes include dermal and respiratory effects, developmental and reproductive toxicity, disruption of metabolic function such as lipid homeostasis, and impairment of mitochondrial function. QACs' role in antimicrobial resistance has also been demonstrated. In the US regulatory system, how a QAC is managed depends on how it is used, for example in pesticides or personal care products. This can result in the same QACs receiving different degrees of scrutiny depending on the use and the agency regulating it. Further, the US Environmental Protection Agency's current method of grouping QACs based on structure, first proposed in 1988, is insufficient to address the wide range of QAC chemistries, potential toxicities, and exposure scenarios. Consequently, exposures to common mixtures of QACs and from multiple sources remain largely unassessed. Some restrictions on the use of QACs have been implemented in the US and elsewhere, primarily focused on personal care products. Assessing the risks posed by QACs is hampered by their vast structural diversity and a lack of quantitative data on exposure and toxicity for the majority of these compounds. This review identifies important data gaps and provides research and policy recommendations for preserving the utility of QAC chemistries while also seeking to limit adverse environmental and human health effects. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

It is becoming more common to find the label with the term BIO. However, synthetic products such as surfactants required for daily activities are distributed in the markets with little or no restrictions. Worldwide, the production of surfactant compounds is around 17 M ton per year, with an expected growth of 3-4% per year. These molecules are widely used in the cleaning, textile, and agro-food industries. However, the continuous use of these synthetic agents has caused environmental toxicology problems due to their recalcitrant nature. Thus, new eco-friendly surfactants are urgently needed. In this sense, microbial surfactants or biosurfactants (BS) are gaining interest in the industry and academia as an alternative to the traditional synthetic surfactants. Biosurfactants are biodegradable molecules with low toxicity, which could be used as cleansers, sanitizers, emulsifiers, pesticides, and detergents. A vital aspect of biosurfactant research is the selection of microbial strains capable of producing surface active compounds.

Our objective was to identify options for pesticide reduction using farmer records from 2549 commercial apple fields in Austria during five years between 2010 and 2016. Using generalized additive mixed modeling, we examined how pesticide use was related to farm management, apple varieties, and meteorological parameters, and how it affected yields and toxicity to honeybees. Apple fields received 29.5 ± 8.6 (mean ± SD) pesticide applications per season at a rate of 56.7 ± 22.7 kg ha−1, which included a total of 228 pesticide products with 80 active ingredients. Over the years, fungicides accounted for 71 % of the pesticide amounts applied, insecticides for 15 %, and herbicides for 8 %. The most frequently used fungicides were sulfur (52 %), followed by captan (16 %) and dithianon (11 %). Of insecticides, paraffin oil (75 %) and chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl (6 % combined) were most frequently used. Among herbicides, glyphosate (54 %), CPA (20 %) and pendimethalin (12 %) were most often used. Pesticide use increased with increasing frequency of tillage and fertilization, increasing field size, increasing spring temperatures, and drier summer conditions. Pesticide use decreased with increasing number of summer days with maximum temperatures >30 °C and number of warm, humid days. Apple yields were significantly positively related to the number of heat days, warm humid nights, and pesticide treatment frequency, but were not affected by frequency of fertilization and tillage. Honeybee toxicity was not related to insecticide use. Pesticide use and yield were significantly related to apple varieties. Our analysis shows that pesticide use in the apple farms studied can be reduced by less fertilization and tillage, partly because yields were >50 % higher than the European average. However, weather extremes related to climate change, such as drier summers, could challenge plans to reduce pesticide use. © 2023 The Authors",NA,503

To compare the methods, an acaricide blend containing three active ingredients (a pyrethroid and two organophosphates) was used. In experiment 1 (farm 1: Goiânia, GO, Brazil), three methods were tested: a backpack sprayer (BS), power sprayer (PS) and spray race (SR). In experiment 2 (farm 2: São José do Rio Pardo, SP, Brazil), two methods were tested: BS and PS. In both experiments, 10 cattle with similar tick burdens were used. On day 0 in both experiments, the animals were treated with the acaricide. On day +1 (only in experiment 1), +3, +7, +14, +21, +28 and +35 (only in experiment 2), tick counts were performed to determine the control efficacy. The time application, pressure (KPa), volume applied (L) and ergonomic aspects of each spraying system were also evaluated. The adult immersion test (AIT) using three different acaricide blends (combinations of pyrethroid + organophosphate) was performed to compare the susceptibility of strains of each farm. In experiment 1, all treatments significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the number of ticks on the animals, and PS resulted in the greatest acaricide efficacy since day +1. In experiment 2, both treatments (PS and BS) reduced (p < 0.05) the tick burden, and as observed in experiment 1, PS resulted in the best reduction. The application times were 4.5, 150 and 330 s, while pressures were 306.8, 4,826.3 and 220.6 KPa for SR, PS and BS, respectively. In the AIT, the efficacy values were between 99.8 and 100% for the tick strain form farm 1 (Goiânia), while for tick strain from farm 2 (São José do Rio Pardo), the efficacy was between 67.2 and 80.9%. We conclude that the sprayer methods chosen influences the efficacy of the acaricide. All sprayer methods were efficient for acaricide application; the best efficacy was obtained using the PS, while the SR resulted in good efficacy and lower application time. The strain from farm 2 was less susceptible to all acaricides tested. © 2023",NA,504

However, for a more accurate assessment of pesticides effect on foraging pollinators, residues found directly on flowers are a more realistic exposure approximation. We conducted a multi-residue analysis of pesticides on pollen and nectar of melon flowers collected from five fields. The cumulative chronic oral exposure Risk Index (RI) was calculated for Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis to multiple pesticides. However, this index could underestimate the risk since sublethal or synergistic effects are not considered. Therefore, a mixture containing three of the most frequently detected pesticides in our study was tested for synergistic impact on B. terrestris micro-colonies through a chronic oral toxicity test. According to the result, pollen and nectar samples contained numerous pesticide residues, including nine insecticides, nine fungicides, and one herbicide. Eleven of those were not applied by farmers during the crop season, revealing that melon agroecosystems may be pesticide contaminated environments. The primary contributor to the chronic RI was imidacloprid and O. bircornis is at greatest risk for lethality resulting from chronic oral exposure at these sites. In the bumblebee micro-colony bioassay, dietary exposure to acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos and oxamyl at residue level concentration, showed no effects on worker mortality, drone production or drone size and no synergies were detected when pesticide mixtures were evaluated. In conclusion, our findings have significant implications for improving pesticide risk assessment schemes to guarantee pollinator conservation. In particular, bee pesticide risk assessment should not be limited to acute exposure effects to isolated active ingredients in honey bees. Instead, risk assessments should consider the long-term pesticide exposure effects in both pollen and nectar on a range of bees that reflect the diversity of natural ecosystems and the synergistic potential among pesticide formulations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,505

This is in stark contrast to the situation for active substances where the mandatory data set comprises a most comprehensive set of studies. While the combination of certain active ingredients and co-formulants may nevertheless result in increased toxicity of the final product such combinations have never been evaluated systematically for complex and long-term toxicological endpoints. We therefore investigated the effect of three frequently used co-formulants on the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic of the representative active substance combination of tebuconazol (Teb) and prothioconazol (Pro) or of cypermethrin (Cpm) and piperonyl butoxide (Pip), respectively. With all four active substances being potential liver steatogens, cytotoxicity and triglyceride accumulation in HepaRG were used as primary endpoints. Concomitantly transcriptomics and biochemical studies were applied to interrogate for effects on gene expression or inhibition of CYP3A4 as key enzyme for functionalization. Some of the tested combinations clearly showed more than additive effects, partly due to CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition. Other effects comprised the modulation of the expression and activity of steatosis-related nuclear key receptors. Altogether, the findings highlight the need for a more systematic consideration of toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic mixture effects during assessment of PPPs. © 2023 The Authors",NA,506

[Blattodea: Ectobiidae]) populations.Three potential reasons for this are high palatability of baits, the use of slow-acting insecticides, and their horizontal transfer within aggregations, a phenomenon known as ‘secondary mortality’. Our objective was to determine whether horizontal transfer can go beyond secondary, to tertiary and quaternary effects, and to compare various gel baits with different active ingredients. We fed adult females a bait and recorded their bait consumption, moribundity, and mortality. Groups of first instars were then exposed to the dead females and their feces, secondary mortality was quantified, and a new cohort of nymphs was then exposed to the feces and dead nymphs (for tertiary mortality); this process was repeated for quaternary mortality. This design did not distinguish among the major mechanisms of horizontal transfer of insecticides, namely coprophagy and contact with feces, exposure to regurgitated fluids, and cannibalism and necrophagy of nymphs. All the tested baits caused 100% mortality of the adult females that directly fed on the bait and high secondary mortality (average of >85%) within 48 hr. Baits containing either dinotefuran, emamectin benzoate, fipronil, or indoxacarb caused tertiary mortality (average of 15–70%), but only the fipronil and indoxacarb baits caused some quaternary mortality.The relative importance of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary transfer of the active ingredient remains to be determined in field populations of the German cockroach. © The Author(s) 2023.

The model aims to support the development of products with targeted AI release profiles. It was motivated by the particular case of a new product formulation releasing phytochemicals with insecticide activity. The well-known analytical solution for the AI transient release from the product is coupled with the analytical solution for the convection-dispersion transport along the tunnel through a simple approximation that introduces a negligible error. An overall analytical solution is thus obtained, having obvious advantages against numerical approximations, particularly for intensive computational tasks such as model fitting to experimental data, uncertainty analysis and product composition optimization. © 2023 The Author(s)",NA,508

This lack of exposure specificity could lead to results that fail to detect an association. It could be related to the lack of consensus on exposure assessment methods and the choice of exposure determinants. We conducted a meta-analysis following the PRISMA checklist to identify PPP exposure determinants used in occupational studies and identified exposure determinants that best characterized agricultural exposures to PPPs. Out of 1436 studies identified, 71 were included. The exposure determinants identified were active ingredients, chemical classes, types of PPP, crops, tasks, frequencies, duration, lifetime exposure days, and intensity-weighted exposure days. Only six over 17 associations between exposure determinants and health outcomes were found with moderate quality of evidence. Overall, epidemiological studies had difficulty defining relevant determinants to characterize PPP exposures for agricultural workers. We recommend that a standardized list of determinants for PPP exposures in occupational exposure studies should include information on formulations, intensity, duration, and frequency of PPP exposure. Harmonized data collection on exposure and health outcomes are required as well as standard units for each exposure determinant. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,510

Some of the pesticides used historically were efficacious, nonselective, persistent, and have led to serious impacts on the environment. A well known, and extensively documented example is the large-scale aerial spray programs in New Brunswick, Canada. From 1952 to 1993, 97% of the 6.2 million ha of the forested lands of New Brunswick were treated with at least one application of one insecticide, the majority of which were applied to control outbreaks of eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). The most well known insecticide was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), applied from 1952 to 1968, which still persists in treated soils and adjacent water bodies, and caused the individual and cumulative ecosystem effects that can still be measured today. The insecticides that replaced DDT were nonpersistent and unlikely to be found today. However, during the years of application some of the insecticides were likely to have impacted local ecosystems to some degree. To aid future studies on the efficacy and environmental impact of these insecticides we created a digital spatial data set of known pesticide application in New Brunswick forestry from 1952 to 1993.

These ingredients, mainly composed of polymeric surfactants, are considered inert vis-à-vis the targeted organisms and nature. Nonetheless, a relatively low attention is given to their analysis and fate tracking in the environment. In this context, the current paper, embedded in a large study of fate and impact of formulated pesticides in soil, focuses on the analysis of these formulation ingredients. It mainly highlights and discusses the characteristic response of these ingredients in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based untargeted screening of two commercial herbicides applied on soil. This characteristic response is based on different spectral and chromatographic aspects, as their amplified adducts and double-charged ions formation, or their “wavy” chromatographic profiles and the inversion of their elution order following the polymerization degree. These patterns are briefly discussed in order to explain them, and then thanks to their understanding, 12 different series (165 compounds) of formulation ingredients were outlined and discriminated from active substance and soil metabolites. After, high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry data were investigated for rapid interseries and intraseries identification-by-chain. In addition, recommendations for methods development and hints on postanalytical data processing for identity determination of these ingredients are given in order to help in enhancing future studies.

One of the highest-risk pathogens involved in these infections is Botrytis cinerea, which is responsible for the grey mold disease. In this study, a biosurfactant extracted from corn steep liquor (CSL), an agro-industrial residue from the corn-milling industry, was used in combination with copper oxychloride (Cu-Oxy), a copper-based pesticide, to evaluate their fungitoxic activity on B. cinerea cells. The results showed that the mixture of 2 g/L of Cu-Oxy with 16 g/L of the biosurfactant extract from CSL, named biosurfactant pesticide formulation (BS-P), helped in the reduction of colony growth, in the decrease of biomass production, and in the improvement of copper bioaccumulation on fungal mycelium in comparison with aqueous solutions of commercial and pure-copper-based fungicides. A factorial design was conducted to obtain the best operational conditions for enhancing the bioaccumulation of copper by B. cinerea cells in the presence of BS-P, resulting in a maximum copper uptake of 2122 µg Cu/g dry weight when using 1 g/L of Cu-Oxy combined with 8 g/L of CSL biosurfactant extract at an incubation temperature of 15 °C. It was also proved that, due to the absence of the biosurfactant extract, the amount of copper bio-adsorbed by fungal mycelium was considerably decreased and, therefore, so was its fungitoxic activity. These results suggest that the biosurfactant extract studied could be involved in eco-friendlier pesticide formulations, reducing the environmental impact of copper-based active principles. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,513

Quantification of all trace organics in the biological fluids seems impossible and costly, regardless of the high individual exposure variability. We hypothesized that the blood concentration (CB) of organic pollutants could be predicted via their exposure and chemical properties. Developing a prediction model on the annotation of chemicals in human blood can provide new insight into the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of chemicals in humans. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict blood concentrations (CBs) of chemicals and prioritize chemicals of health concern. METHODS: We curated the CBs of compounds mostly measured at population levels and developed an ML model for chemical CB predictions by considering chemical daily exposure (DE) and exposure pathway indicators (dij), half-lives (t1=2), and volume of distribution (Vd). Three ML models, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were compared. The toxicity potential or prioritization of each chemical was represented as a bioanalytical equivalency (BEQ) and its percentage (BEQ%) estimated based on the predicted CB and ToxCast bioactivity data. We also retrieved the top 25 most active chemicals in each assay to further observe changes in the BEQ% after the exclusion of the drugs and endogenous substances. RESULTS: We curated the CBs of 216 compounds primarily measured at population levels. RF outperformed the ANN and SVF models with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.66 and 2:07 lM, the mean absolute error (MAE) values of 1.28 and 1:56 lM, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.29 and 0.23, and R2 of 0.80 and 0.72 across test and testing sets. Subsequently, the human CBs of 7,858 ToxCast chemicals were successfully predicted, ranging from 1:29 × 10−6 to 1:79 × 10−2 lM. The predicted CBs were then combined with ToxCast in vitro bioassays to prioritize the ToxCast chemicals across 12 in vitro assays with important toxicological end points. It is interesting that we found the most active compounds to be food additives and pesticides rather than widely monitored environmental pollutants. DISCUSSION: We have shown that the accurate prediction of “internal exposure” from “external exposure” is possible, and this result can be quite useful in the risk prioritization. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11305. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The main outcome of the regulatory tests is “lethal concentration 50″ (LC50), i.e. the concentration that will kill 50% of the exposed animals. However, ongoing work aims to identify New Approach Methods (NAMs) to replace animal experiments. To this end, we studied 11 plant protection products, sold in the European Union (EU), for their ability to inhibit lung surfactant function in vitro in the constrained drop surfactometer (CDS). In vivo, inhibition of lung surfactant function can lead to alveolar collapse and reduction of tidal volume. Therefore, we also assessed changes in breathing patterns of mice during exposure to the same products. Six of the eleven products inhibited lung surfactant function, and six products reduced tidal volume in mice. In vitro inhibition of lung surfactant function predicted reduction in tidal volume in exposed mice with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 60%. Two products were labelled as “harmful if inhaled”, both inhibited surfactant function in vitro and reduced tidal volume in mice. Lung surfactant function inhibition in vitro predicted reduction in tidal volume for plant protection products to a lesser degree than for previously tested substances. This could owe to the requirement for rigorous testing of plant protection products prior to approval that might have selected against substances that could potentially inhibit lung surfactant, e.g. due to severe adverse effects during inhalation. © 2023 The Authors",NA,515

There is a high risk of exposure in granivorous birds, such as the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), that can consume those seeds remaining on the surface during sowing. Fungicide exposure could in turn affect bird reproductive capacity. To better understand to what extent triazole fungicides are a threat to granivorous birds, we need an easy and reliable method to quantify field exposure. In this study, we tested a novel non-invasive method to detect the presence of triazole fungicide residues in farmland bird faeces. We experimentally exposed captive red-legged partridges to validate the method, and then applied it in a real scenario to assess exposure of wild partridges. We exposed adult partridges to seeds treated with two formulations containing triazole fungicides as active ingredients: Vincit®Minima (flutriafol 2.5%) and Raxil®Plus (prothioconazole 25% and tebuconazole 15%). We collected two types of faeces (caecal and rectal samples) immediately after exposure and 7 days later and quantified the concentrations of the three triazoles and their common metabolite (1,2,4-triazole). The three active ingredients and 1,2,4-triazole were only detected in faeces collected immediately after exposure. Triazole fungicide detection rates in rectal stool were 28.6%, 73.3% and 80% for flutriafol, prothioconazole and tebuconazole, respectively. In caecal samples, detection rates were 40%, 93.3% and 33.3%, respectively. 1,2,4-triazole was detected in 53% of rectal samples. For an applied use of the method in the field, we collected 43 faecal samples from wild red-legged partridges during autumn cereal seed sowing and found detectable levels of tebuconazole in 18.6% of the analysed wild partridges. The results of the experiment were then used to estimate actual exposure levels from this prevalence value found in wild birds. Our study shows that faecal analysis can be a useful tool to assess farmland bird exposure to triazole fungicides, when samples are fresh and the method has been validated for the detection of target molecules. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,516

Herein, we propose an effective strategy to solve these issues via designing a green and functional surfactant, 2D Janus nanosheets (JNSs), based on adhesive catecholamine compounds to stabilize a pesticide-loaded Pickering emulsion. First, amphipathic 2D octadecylamine-polypyrogallol JNSs (ODA-PPG JNSs) are prepared by a facile and one-step route and are applied to construct a versatile Pickering emulsion. The JNSs-stabilized Pickering emulsions present a remarkable tolerance stability toward ultra-pH (pH = 3, 11) and can achieve an unusual phase inversion accompanying the variation of emulsion viscoelasticity. Owing to the outstanding adhesivity and surfactivity endowed by ODA-PPG JNSs, the pesticide emulsion loaded with a model pesticide avermectin (Av-Emul) performs significantly enhanced foliar deposition than the commercial Av-Tech. Combined with the theoretical calculation, the adhesion mechanism involved in the synergistic action of π-πstacking and H-bonds is unraveled in a molecular scale. The ""JNSs-stabilized pesticide emulsions"" not only present excellent adhesion on both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces but also outperform the other conventional pesticide emulsions stabilized by small-molecule surfactants in wettability and spreadability to reduce droplets bouncing on the foliage. This work provides an insight into the structure-adhesivity relationship derived from the non-covalent interaction of polyphenolic JNSs. The proposed innovative strategy for facilitating pesticide utilization demonstrates great promise in formulating agrochemicals. © 2023 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.",NA,517

The applications of biosurfactants in agriculture are diverse. They can be used as emulsifying and dispersing agents, improving soil quality and nutrient bioavailability for beneficial microbes associated with plants, eliminating phytopathogens, and removing pesticides, among other activities. In this way, they are perfect biomolecules to be used as active biological components in different types of bioformulations for agricultural activities. Bioformulations are products that contain biological fractions or the entire microorganism as active ingredients. Agricultural products obtained through these formulations can contribute to the increment and improvement of crop quality and indirectly to the health of producers and consumers. In this chapter, we seek to introduce agriculture due to the importance of sustainability of its activities, to present some of the agrochemicals already used to control different pests, types of agrochemicals, and composition of bioformulations.

Additionally, we aimed to assess its safety in nontarget nematodes found in soil at a site subjected to contamination by acaricides. The nanoformulations were characterized by dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Nanoformulations 1 (ZN+CYPE+CHLO+citral), 2 (ZN+CYPE+CHLO+menthol), and 3 (ZN+CYPE+CHLO+limonene) were measured for diameter, polydispersion, zeta potential, concentration, and encapsulation efficiency.

This review clarifies the role of cannabinoid compounds in parasitic infections caused by helminths and protozoa. In addition, this study briefly presented the use of C. sativa constituents in the formulation of pesticides for vector control, as the latter topic is justified by the economic burden faced by several regions where vector-borne diseases are a troubling reality.

The purified microbial form of biosurfactant is called surfactin. Biosurfactant is safer for the environment, less poisonous, and easily decomposable than chemical surfactants. Several microbial enzymes are involved in the process of bioremediation (lyases, oxidoreductases, peroxidases, cellulase, protease, dehalogenases, hydrolases, etc.). Biosurfactants are surface dynamic molecules synthesized by microbes with numerous features such as being nontoxic, easily biodegradable, reducing surface tension, stabilizing emulsions, and enhancing foam. The main role of biosurfactants is to reduce the interface and surface tension of hydrocarbon and water solutions. Biosurfactants have recently gained much attention due to their high utility in industrial and environmental processes. It has numerous applications in the food industry, including lecithin, additives, ethoxyated byproducts, and monoglycerides. The biosurfactant is very smart in the healthcare and cosmetic industry. Numerous primary and secondary metabolites are produced by microbes that possess several biological applications. Many hydrocarbons are released into the environment from animals, plants, and microbes. According to existing reports, biosurfactants are being used for oil cleanup, soil remediation, pesticide manufacturing, plant growth promoters, drug delivery, medicine, agriculture, and environmental safety.

The active ingredients of these formulations can enter the human body through air, food, or water. Epidemiological studies suggest that these compounds strongly affect the developing brain in fetal and infant stages due to their ability to breach the underdeveloped blood–brain barrier. Since neural progenitor stem cells (NPCs) in the developing brain are the most vulnerable to these compounds, the mechanisms by which NPCs experience toxicity upon exposure to these chemicals must be investigated. Here, we assessed the viability of human fetal NPCs in 2D cultures in the presence of the active ingredients of six widely used pesticides using Live/Dead® and Hoechst staining. The IC50 values ranged from 4.1–201 μM. A significant drop in cell viability with increasing toxicant concentration (p < 0.01) was noted, with the order of toxicity being malathion < 4-aminopyridine < methoprene < prallethrin < temephos < pyriproxyfen. Changes in cellular biomechanical characteristics (Young’s modulus, tether force, membrane tension, and tether radius) were quantified using atomic force microscopy, whereas cell migration was elucidated over 48 h using a customized wound-healing assay. The Young’s modulus of fetal NPCs exposed to IC50/2 doses of these compounds was reduced by 38–70% and that of those exposed to IC50 doses was reduced by 71–80% (p < 0.001 vs. controls for both; p < 0.01 for IC50 vs. IC50/2 for each compound). Similar patterns were noted for tether forces and membrane tension in fetal NPCs. NPC migration was found to be compound type- and dose-dependent. These results attest to the significant detrimental effects of these compounds on various aspects of the human fetal NPC phenotype, and the utility of cell mechanics as a marker to assess developmental neurotoxicity. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,523

Considering the large-scale application of agrochemicals globally, the elimination of N-nitrosamines from pesticides should be a priority for manufacturers and regulators. A set of methods was developed and validated for the determination of the toxicologically relevant N-nitrosamine impurity of ethalfluralin (ethyl-N-(2-methylallyl) N-nitroso amine—EMANA) in 33% w v−1 emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulations. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) was compared with the “dilute and shoot” approach. Gas chromatography (GC) was combined with Flame Ionization Detection (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS). For MS, two mass filtering modes (Selective Ion Monitoring—SIM, tandem mass spectrometry—MS/MS) and two ionization modes (Electron Ionization—EI, Positive chemical ionization—PCI) were applied. It was concluded that, in the case of samples with high nitrosamine concentration (>90 μg g−1), the “dilute and shoot” approach can be applied without compromising the quality of the results. SPE, however, is required to attain the LOQ (0.33 μg g−1) with good recovery (97.4–110.67%), linearity (R > 0.99) and precision (%RSD 0.68–1.74). The LOQ supersedes the limit set by EFSA (1 μg g−1) in the Technical Active Substance—TAS. The concentration range of the methods is 0.05–110 μg g−1.

Past efforts using ivermectin for livestock were reported effective at controlling both Amblyomma americanum (L.) and Ixodes scapularis Say on Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann). However, the labeled 48-day withdrawal period for human consumption largely prevented utilization of this strategy targeting I. scapularis in autumn, when peak adult host-seeking activity coincides with regulated white-tailed deer hunting seasons. The modern-day compound moxidectin is the active ingredient in the pour-on formulation Cydectin (5 mg moxidectin/ml; Bayer Healthcare LLC), with a labeled 0-day withdrawal period for human consumption of treated cattle. We sought to re-examine the systemic acaricide approach for tick management by determining if we could successfully deliver Cydectin to free-ranging white-tailed deer. Over 2 yr in late spring/early summer, coinciding with adult and nymphal A. americanum activity, we fed Cydectin-coated corn to free-ranging white-tailed deer in coastal Connecticut. Through serum analysis, we documented moxidectin levels at or above those previously reported effective for control of ectoparasites (5-8 ppb for moxidectin and ivermectin) in 24 of 29 white-tailed deer captured (83%) while exposed to treated corn. While we did not document differences in burdens of parasitizing A. americanum based on moxidectin sera levels, we did document fewer engorged specimens on deer with increased sera levels. The systemic use of moxidectin for tick management in critical reproductive hosts has the potential to be effective in an areawide capacity while also permitting human consumption of treated venison.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Specifically, three inert dusts—namely, a kaolin, a zeolite and a diatomaceous earth formulation—and three residual insecticides—i.e., the pyrethroid deltamethrin, the bacterial insecticide spinosad and the juvenile hormone analogue S-Methoprene—were evaluated against adults of P. truncatus. Adult mortality was assessed after 7, 14, 21 and 28 d of exposure, whereas progeny production was measured after an additional interval of 28 d for inert dusts and 65 d for the contact insecticides. Moreover, the number and weight of infested and uninfested kernels per vial was measured. Low mortality levels were recorded for the three inert dusts even for the highest application rate and after 28 d of exposure. Moreover, the inert dusts tested failed to suppress the progeny production of P. truncatus. In contrast, high mortality levels were recorded for deltamethrin and spinosad that exceeded 95% already after 7 d of exposure at the lowest application rate (0.5 ppm).

In the study, the effect of an insecticide, which is a commercial formulation of orange oil, on egg laying behavior and acaricidal effect on T. urticae at different doses were investigated. The experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions at 65±10% humidity and 25±2°C temperature conditions, on bean leaves, using leaf disc dipping method, using 5 different application doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1 and 2 ml of 100 ml-1 water) and 5 was carried out recursively. Observations were made at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the application by taking the counts of dead and live individuals. As a result of this study, the highest acaricidal effect on T. urticae individuals was determined with a mortality rate of 75.56% at 2% concentration of orange oil 96 hours after the application. In the 96th hour observations, the lowest acaricidal effect was detected at a concentration of 20% to 0.2%. Accordingly, it was observed that the acaricide effect increased as the concentration and duration of the orange oil studied in the study increased. When the effect of the insecticide with orange oil active substance on the egg laying behavior of T. urticae was examined, the number of eggs in the control group was determined as 99.40±1.26 at the same observation time, at the 2% concentration of the insecticide used, while 8.80±1.87 eggs were detected at the end of 96 hours. As a result, the acaricidal effect of orange oil on T. urticae shows that it can be used as an alternative control agent to chemical control. © Bu çalışma Tekirdağ Namık Kemal Üniversitesi tarafından Creative Commons Lisansı (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) kapsamında yayınlanmıştır.

Because insect repellents are effective topical barriers to the spread of arthropod-borne infectious illnesses. Plant-based (natural) and chemical-based products are both used (synthetic) as a mosquito repellents, which come in a variety of forms such as mosquito repeller coils, mosquito repeller oil, and so on, are becoming more popular around the world as vector-borne viral diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Malaria become more prevalent. The best alternative to the optimal formulation is determined by a number of elements, including the type of repellent (natural or synthetic), medicinal forms (spray, lotion, cream, gel), duration of action (short or long), exposure environment, and user (adult, pregnant women, children, newborn). DEET, IPicaridin, and essential oils are the most commonly utilised repellents, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. DEET is not suggested for children under the age of six months or pregnant women because of its toxicity. The current tendency is to employ pant-based repellent active compounds like essential oils, which have minimal toxicity, are environmentally friendly, but have a shorter repellent action period due to quick evaporation after skin contact. Repellents could be a visible option for people to reduce the risk of interaction with rare mosquito-borne diseases for mosquito borne diseases. The review highlights a summary of mosquito repellents, its novel discoveries, and areaof technicalstudies such as the novel and unique repellent formulations and their potentialfuture. © 2023, Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

In this context, the main objective of this study is the development of clay/essential oil formulations against this type of fungus. Double-layer hydroxides (LDHs) and Ghassoul were chosen as clays, and Thyme as an essential oil and its active principle, thymol. The LDHs and Ghassoul materials underwent purification and activation treatments to increase their compatibility with the chosen essential oil. The different materials obtained were characterized by XRD and FTIR. The chemical compositions of the EOs were analyzed by GC–MS chromatography. The main constituents of Thyme oil founded were thymol (67.13%), ρ-cymene (4.85%), Z-Caryophyllene (1.77%) and γ-terpinene (2.74%). The adsorption of thymol on the different materials developed: activated Ghassoul (Gh-A), Hydrotalcite (HT3), and LDH (ZnAl-CO3), showed that the adsorption isotherms can be satisfactorily described by the Langmuir model. Also, the modeling of the adsorption kinetics revealed its conformity to the pseudo-second order model for the different materials. As a result, the adsorption capacity of thymol increases in the following order: ZnAl-CO3, HT3, and Gh-A. The formulations made from the different clays allowed for the preparation of an effective and useful fungicide for wheat storage. The in vitro antifungal activities were tested against the strain Penicillium sp. The results obtained revealed that the formulations based on Gh-A and LDHs retained their antifungal activity even after 5 months of storage. Therefore, in order to evaluate the potential of the formulations on cereals storage (wheat storage case), in vitro antifungal tests with the Gh-A/Thyme formulation were performed on four types of wheat (sterile, non-sterile, dried, and washed then dried wheat). These experiments demonstrated that sterile and washed-dried wheat had a significant inhibition against Penicillium sp. growth even after six months of storage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",NA,533

The application of toxic baits may cause side effects on the native parasitoid Doryctobracon areolatus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Based on the results, formulations made from the food attractants 3% Biofruit, 1.5% Ceratrap, 1.25% Flyral, 3% Isca Samaritá, 3% Isca Samaritá Tradicional, and 7% sugarcane molasses associated with the Malathion 1000 EC and the ready-to-use toxic bait Gelsura (containing the active ingredient alpha-cypermethrin) were classified as harmful (class 4) to D. areolatus (mortality > 85% at 96 HAE). In contrast, for toxic baits formulated with insecticide phosmet, the mortality ranged from 38% to 72%, classified as slightly harmful or moderately harmful. However, when phosmet was added to the 3% Samaritá Tradicional bait, the mortality was only 3.9% (class 1 - harmless), similar to the toxicity observed for the Success 0.02 CB ready-to-use bait (0.24 g a.i. spinosad/l) (<5% mortality). Although toxic baits were formulated with spinosyn-based insecticides, all toxic bait formulations were classified as harmless or slightly harmful (<50% mortality) to D. areolatus, with the exception of 1.5% Ceratrap + spinetoram and 7% Sugarcane molasses + spinosad (≈ 60% mortality - moderately harmful). In addition, these formulations did not show sublethal effects in reducing the parasitism and emergence rate of the F1 generation of D. areolatus in A. fraterculus larvae.

As they are not designed to target insects, the mechanisms behind potential impacts of these pesticides are unclear. It is therefore important to understand their influence at a range of levels, including sublethal impacts on behaviours such as learning. We used the proboscis extension reflex (PER) paradigm to assess how the herbicide glyphosate and the fungicide prothioconazole affect bumblebee olfactory learning. We also assessed responsiveness, and compared the impacts of these active ingredients and their respective commercial formulations (Roundup Biactive and Proline). We found that learning was not impaired by either formulation but, of the bees that displayed evidence of learning, exposure to prothioconazole active ingredient increased learning level in some situations, while exposure to glyphosate active ingredient resulted in bumblebees being less likely to respond to antennal stimulation with sucrose. Our data suggest that fungicides and herbicides may not negatively impact olfactory learning ability when bumblebees are exposed orally to field-realistic doses in a lab setting, but that glyphosate has the potential to cause changes in responsiveness in bees. As we found impacts of active ingredients and not commercial formulations, this suggests that co-formulants may modify impacts of active ingredients in the products tested on olfactory learning without being toxic themselves. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, and to evaluate the implications of behavioural changes caused by glyphosate and prothioconazole for bumblebee fitness. © 2023.

Trunk injection of nematicides is currently the most preferred method of control. This study aimed to evaluate the potency of the commonly used formulations of abamectin against B. xylophilus. Twenty-one formulations of abamectin were evaluated by comparing their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials against B. xylophilus. Nematodes were treated with diluted formulation concentrations in multi-well culture plates. And, populations preexposed to pre-determined concentrations of the formulations were inoculated onto Botrytis cinerea culture, and in pine twig cuttings. Potency was contrastingly different among formulations, with LC95 of 0.00285 and 0.39462 mg/ml for the most, and the least potent formulation, respectively. Paralysis generally occurred at an application dose of 0.06 μg/ ml or higher, and formulations with high sublethal toxicities caused significant paralysis levels at the tested doses, albeit the variations. Nematode reproduction was evident at lower doses of 0.00053-0.0006 μg/ml both on Botrytis cinerea and pine twigs, with significant variations among formulations. Thus, the study highlighted the inconsistencies in the potency of similar product formulations with the same active ingredient concentration against the target organism, and the need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the additives used in formulations. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.",NA,536

It has been found that proper surfactants can promote the droplet spread on such surfaces. However, most reports involved the effects of surfactants on the spread of the gently released droplets over hydrophobic or highly hydrophobic substrates, while the situation on superhydrophobic substrates has rarely been explored. Moreover, high-speed impact makes it extremely difficult to deposit and spread the aqueous droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces; thus, the deposition and spread have just been achieved by surfactants in recent years. Here, we give an overview concerning the influence factors on the deposition and spreading performance of gently released and high-speed impacted droplets on hydrophobic/superhydrophobic substrates and emphasize the effects of fast aggregation of surfactants at the interface and in solution. We also outline perspectives on the future development of surfactant-assisted deposition and spreading after high-speed impact. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,538

An overview on recent developments, benefits, environmental hazards and future prospectives",2023,Journal of Cleaner Production,411,NA,NA,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137232,"The world is seeking hard for sustainable agricultural practices with one of the prime objectives to improve crop yield through effective pest management. Scientific diaspora has already established that a significant amount of the pesticide is not being used by the crops and finds its way into the environment through leaching, evaporation, sorption etc., leading to adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology is bringing a revolutionary change in agriculture through effective pest management. The main purpose of introducing nano-pesticides is to reduce the indiscriminate use of conventional pesticides and their harmful impacts on the environment. Nano-formulations can improve the efficiency of pesticides by enhancing permeability, solubility, and stability along-with controlling their release profile and protecting them from premature degradation. The present review is accordingly assembled to significantly investigate the developmental updates of nano-pesticides since the past decades, their ultimate fate, ecotoxicological risks and betterment over their conventional analogues. Nano-pesticides including nanomaterials as active ingredients, nano-encapsulations, nano-emulsions, nano-suspensions are discussed. Additionally, critical information and the foreseeable research gaps in this emerging area are highlighted. Currently, there is a dearth of fundamental knowledge about how nano-formulations will behave in the environment. It is still unclear whether they will genuinely produce noticeable benefits or represent a new class of hazards. Very scanty information is available on their ecotoxicological behaviour, guidelines, and policymaking for their safer use globally. Introducing these smart nano-formulations within the domain of the current pesticide regulatory frameworks is still under debate. Thus, a discussion of the pros and cons of nano-pesticides is of prime importance for justifying their status of cleaner production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,539

However, their biological, surface, and behavior to use with agrochemicals has not been investigated. RESULTS: Critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) for the synthetic surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), the bio-surfactant rhamnolipid (RL), and the bio-surfactant surfactin (SF) were 1200, 50, and 50 mg L−1, respectively. Based on the ability of the surfactants to reduce the surface tension of trifloxysulfuron-sodium spray solution at 0.25 to 1× CMC, they are ranked SF > RL > DOSS, while at 1.5 to 4× CMC, they are ranked SF = RL > DOSS. Without surfactant, trifloxysulfuron-sodium at 10.04 g ha−1 reduced johnsongrass growth up to 50% (ED50). At best, SF at 1 to 4× CMC halved ED50. Unlike DOSS, which increased ED50 (12.89 g ha−1) due to a phytotoxic effect, SF and RL at 4× CMC decreased ED50 (5.19 and 6.50 g ha−1, respectively) without a phytotoxic effect. A 5-μl droplet containing SF dried faster due to greater spread on the leaf surface than other surfactants. Although the wetted area of the leaf with the droplet containing RL was wider than that of DOSS, it took longer to dry. This observation contradicts the previous theory. CONCLUSION: In terms of dosage, safety, and efficacy, the RL and SF were comparable to DOSS in other tank-mix with trifloxysulfuron-sodium. It seems that RL also works as a humectant, while SF likely works as a wax solubilisant. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,540

Formulations based on natural isolates of the Anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) (Baculoviridae: Alphabaculovirus) played a significant role in integrated pest management programs in the early 2000s, but a new generation of chemical insecticides and transgenic soybean have displaced AgMNPV-based products over the past decade. However, the marked genotypic variability present among and within alphabaculovirus isolates suggests that highly insecticidal genotypic variants can be isolated and used to reduce virus production costs or overcome isolate-dependent host resistance. This study aimed to select novel variants of AgMNPV with suitable insecticidal traits that could complement the existing AgMNPV active ingredients. Three distinct AgMNPV isolates were compared using their restriction endonuclease profile and in terms of their occlusion body (OB) pathogenicity. One isolate was selected (AgABB51) from which eighteen genotypic variants were plaque purified and characterized in terms of their insecticidal properties. The five most pathogenic variants varied in OB pathogenicity, although none of them was faster-killing or had higher OB production characteristics than the wild-type isolate. We conclude that the AgABB51 wild-type isolates appear to be genotypically structured for fast speed of kill and high OB production, both of which would favor horizontal transmission. Interactions among the component variants are likely to influence this insecticidal phenotype. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,541

This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value. The commercial formulation composed of deltamethrin+imidacloprid followed the concentration addition model (when compared with parameters retrieved from individual a.i.) and the other three mixtures evaluated (I: chlorothalonil-propineb-deltamethrin+imidacloprid; II: chlorothalonil-propineb-ziram-thiocyclam; III: chlorothalonil-propineb-chlorpyrifos) produced an antagonistic effect on D. magna, thus suggesting less acute toxicity than their individual components. Subsequent chronic studies showed that one of the most toxic mixtures (II) negatively affected D. magna reproduction at sublethal concentrations indicating that this mixture poses a risk to this species if these pesticides co-exist in freshwater systems. These findings provide useful data to better estimate the impact of real agricultural practices related to the use of agrochemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,542

However, specific modes of action for ZNP have not been elucidated. Diet overlay bioassays attempted to rule out the hypothesis that A. gemmatalis mortality was caused by surface charges from component surfactants. Overlay bioassays indicated that negatively charged zein nanoparticles [(-)ZNP] and its anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), exhibited no toxic effects when compared to the untreated check. Nonionic zein nanoparticles [(N)ZNP] appeared to increase mortality compared to the untreated check, though larval weights were unaffected. Overlay results for (+)ZNP and its cationic surfactant, didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), were found to be consistent with former research indicating high mortalities, and thus, dosage response curves were conducted. Concentration response tests found the LC50 for DDAB on A. gemmatalis neonates was 208.82 a.i./ml. To rule out possible antifeedant capabilities, dual choice assays were conducted. Results indicated that neither DDAB nor (+)ZNP were antifeedants, while SDS reduced feeding when compared to other treatment solutions. Oxidative stress was tested as a possible mode of action, with antioxidant levels used as a proxy for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A. gemmatalis neonates, which were fed diet treated with different concentrations of (+)ZNP and DDAB. Results indicated that both (+)ZNP and DDAB decreased antioxidant levels compared to the untreated check, suggesting that both (+)ZNP and DDAB may inhibit antioxidant levels.

Numerous studies have suggested that nanopesticides could soon fully replace conventional pesticides since they are far more effective than those now in use.

Nanopesticides are pesticides that have been made with these nanoparticles and have a high application efficiency and significantly fewer hazardous environmental impacts than pesticides that have been made chemically. Various formulation strategies, which include the containment of the active substance by the nanoparticles, have previously been established, exhibiting promising effects on the pests.

Subsequently, ZnOGer1 NCs and ZnOGer2 NCs were tested by foliar application on B. cinerea-inoculated tomato and cucumber plants, showing a significant reduction of disease severity. The foliar application of both NCs resulted in more effective inhibition of the pathogen in the infected cucumber plants as compared to the treatment with the chemical fungicide Luna Sensation SC. In contrast, tomato plants treated with ZnOGer2 NCs demonstrated a better inhibition of the disease as compared to the treatment with ZnOGer1 NCs and Luna. None of the treatments caused phytotoxic effects. These results support the potential for the use of the specific NCs as plant protection agents against B. cinerea in agriculture as an effective alternative to synthetic fungicides. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,548

One of the causes of this decline is the use of pesticides. Pesticides with glyphosate as the main active ingredient are among the most used pesticides worldwide, being the most used in Brazil. This study determined the 24 and 48 h LD50 (median lethal dose) of the herbicide’s glyphosate-based formulation by ingestion, identified sublethal doses, and investigated its effects on the locomotion and behavior of Tetragonisca angustula workers. The LD50 found indicates that a glyphosate-based formulation is highly toxic to T. angustula. The doses applied, including concentrations found in nature, caused death, motor changes (decreased speed and tremors), excessive self-cleaning, and disorientation (return to light and stop). Although we did not test for pollination effects, we can infer from our results that this formulation can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula. Evaluation of the toxicity and sublethal effects of pesticides on bees contributes to a better understanding of their harmful effects on hives and allows for the development of strategies to reduce these impacts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,549

For ATSBs to be more widely accepted, demonstrably effective ingredients need to be verified. We investigated erythritol as a toxic additive in sugar meals against Aedes aegypti (L.) for potential future use in ATSBs. Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that is commonly used as a sugar substitute, while also being toxic to mosquitoes. Our studies tested formulations of erythritol, sucrose, and blends of both. Secondary investigations included combinations with the active ingredients Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, spinosyn, and boric acid. Adult Ae. aegypti were separated into test groups and provided various combinations. Formulations containing erythritol, with or without another toxicant, exhibited 90% mortality within 72 h of observation (P = 0.03192). Additionally, erythritol appeared more effective when combined with sucrose in a 1:1 ratio (5% concentration each). This combination showed a 24% and 85% increase in mortality when combined with boric acid and Bti, respectively, at 48 h compared with equivalent groups containing only 10% sucrose. Erythritol appears to kill adult mosquitoes, even in relatively low concentrations, without another toxicant being required. However, erythritol also effectively enhances kill of main ingredient toxicants such as boric acid and Bti, showing a supporting role. The low concentration of erythritol needed to provide significant kill, its ability to fill in as both a sugar base and toxicant, and its ability to be safely handled by humans makes erythritol a strong candidate for use as a supporting ingredient in future bait formulations.  © 2023 The Author(s).",NA,550

This article critically assesses various strategies pursued by EU Member States and regional authorities which challenge the EU approach to glyphosate and aim to safeguard their higher levels of public health and environmental protection. It reflects on the prospects of success of these strategies, and their compatibility with EU law. The analysis includes the action for the annulment of glyphosate's 2017 reapproval brought by the Brussels-Capital Region, the Austrian attempt to enact a blanket ban on glyphosate-based pesticidal formulations, and the more sophisticated strategies pursued by Luxembourg and France. The article concludes that the French strategy is effective in risk regulation terms, and compatible with EU law. Nonetheless, adopting the French approach may prove rather difficult for other Member States, as a result of both structural-regulatory and practical constraints. Rather, an EU-wide strategy on glyphosate is urgently needed.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.",NA,552

Since the hazards of this safener, individually and in combination with its herbicide, toward non-target aquatic organisms, were not known,acute and chronic studies were conducted on various endpoints in embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Endpoints during acute exposures included mortality and hatchability. During chronic exposures, the growth and survival of larvae were determined. Exposure to concentrations of MEF > 3 mg/L alone significantly decreased the rate of hatching, while exposure to FEN alone to > 3 mg/L had no significant effect on the rate of hatching. However, exposure to each of the chemicals individually caused some delay in hatching. When exposed in combination with FEN, adverse effects of MEF on the rate of hatching were mitigated in a dose-dependent manner. During the acute exposure to 3 mg/L, mortality was caused by MEF than FEN. During chronic exposures to 0.1 or 1.0 mg/L, MEF has more toxic potency than FEN. Both compounds caused some abnormalities, including pericardial edema, spinal curvature, tail malformation, and edema of the yoke sac. Based on the activities of SOD and GST, both MEF and FEN caused oxidative stress. FEN reduced the toxic potency of MEF when exposed together, but there were more deformities of greater severity in embryos exposed to MEF than those exposed to FEN. Molecular docking showed that both chemicals could potentially inhibit the activity of sex hormones and hatching enzymes. These results demonstrate that while classified as ""inert"", the safener, and FEN can cause various effects, including molecular responses and lethality and should be monitored and regulated. © 2023",NA,553

With the proposed technology, it is now possible to introduce chemical substances into polymer filaments that were previously impossible to apply due to undergoing physical or chemical transformations during previous processing processes. This article discusses methods that eliminate the need for costly and energy-consuming processing equipment. These methods can be utilized in any laboratory by users without access to specialized devices. A novel L-FDM technique that builds upon the fundamentals of the FDM additive manufacturing process has been developed. It includes a mechanism that directly incorporates a chemical substance and alters polymer fibers throughout the fine process. This method eliminates the need for additional extrusion operations and compounding equipment to introduce chemical additives and solvents. This advancement opens up new opportunities for printers to be used in chemical labs to test new or known chemical substances. The paper outlines the technological assumptions, potential applications, and practical examples of direct filament modification using the L-FDM technique.

Biopolymeric nanoparticles as nanocarriers have the potential to improve insecticide efficacy by improving absorption, coverage, and permeability while protecting the insecticide active ingredient from abiotic conditions and extending efficacy through controlled release. We conducted a series of experiments using a biopolymeric nanoparticle synthesized from zein, a biodegradable maize protein, to compare efficacy of a nanodelivered hydrophobic insect growth regulator (methoxyfenozide) against a commercial formulation. Positively charged zein nanoparticles (empty and loaded with methoxyfenozide) were compared to the formulated product, Intrepid 2F, as a foliar spray in-field on soybean. Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) was used as a model and was fed sprayed soybean leaves to evaluate efficacy of the tested foliar products over time. A separate set of leaves was sampled to measure residue levels of methoxyfenozide (MFZ) over time following foliar application using QuEChERS extraction and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Regression analysis found no differences in mortality slopes between positively charged zein nanoparticles loaded with methoxyfenozide [(+)ZNP(MFZ)] and Intrepid 2F, suggesting comparable efficacy of the synthesized nanoparticles to a commercial product. Higher concentrations of MFZ were present in (+)ZNP(MFZ)-treated in leaf tissue at 3 d following spray when compared to Intrepid 2F.

By investigating these strategies, we can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which they influence methane production and identify promising approaches for sustainable mitigation of methane emissions. Out of all nutritional strategies, the use of 3-nitrooxypropanol, red seaweed, tannins, saponins, essential oils, nitrates, and sulfates demonstrates the potential to reduce emissions and receives a lot of attention from the scientific community. The use of certain additives as pure compounds is challenging under certain conditions, such as pasture-based systems, so the potential use of forages with sufficient amounts of plant secondary metabolites is also explored. Additionally, improved forage quality (maturity and nutrient composition) might help to further reduce emissions. Red seaweed, although proven to be very effective in reducing emissions, raises some questions regarding the volatility of the main active compound, bromoform, and challenges regarding the cultivation of the seaweed. Other relatively new methods of mitigation, such as the use of cyanogenic glycosides, are also discussed in this article. Together with nitrates, cyanogenic glycosides pose serious risks to animal health, but research has proven their efficacy and safety when control measures are taken. Furthermore, the risks of nitrate use can be minimized by using probiotics. Some of the discussed strategies, namely monensin or halogenated hydrocarbons (as pure compounds), demonstrate efficacy but are unlikely to be implemented widely because of legal restrictions. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,557

Here, a novel and eco-sustainable nanostructured particle formulation (NPF) is presented by following the principles of the circular economy. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and resistant starch were obtained from the bran of a high amylose (HA) bread wheat and employed as carrier and excipient, while chitosan and gallic acid were functionalized as antifungal and elicitor active principles. The NPF inhibited conidia germination and mycelium growth, and mechanically interacted with conidia. The NPF optimally reduced FHB and FCR symptoms in susceptible bread wheat genotypes while being biocompatible on plants. The expression level of 21 genes involved in the induction of innate immunity was investigated in Sumai3 (FHB resistant) Cadenza (susceptible) and Cadenza SBEIIa (a mutant characterized by high-amylose starch content) and most of them were up-regulated in Cadenza SBEIIa spikes treated with the NPF, indicating that this genotype may possess an interesting genomic background particularly responsive to elicitor-like molecules. Quantification of fungal biomass revealed that the NPF controlled FHB spread, while Cadenza SBEIIa was resistant to FCR fungal spread. The present research work highlights that the NPF is a powerful weapon for FHB sustainable management, while the genome of Cadenza SBEIIa should be investigated deeply as particularly responsive to elicitor-like molecules and resistant to FCR fungal spread. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,558

Under controlled laboratory conditions, the residual activity ranged from 1 week (S-methoprene) up to 2 months (spinosad, PDMS). Exposure of larvicides under semi-field conditions resulted in noticeable differences regarding their efficacy as compared to the laboratory bioassays. Exposure of S-methoprene, Bti, and spinosad, for up to 3 days, resulted in similar adult emergence to the controls.

Previous research revealed that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the S-16 strain have strong inhibitory effects on Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The identification of the VOCs of S-16 using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) revealed 35 compounds. Technical-grade formulations of four of these compounds were chosen for further study: 2-pentadecanone, 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-octanone, 2-methyl benzothiazole (2-MBTH), and heptadecane. The major constituent, 2-MBTH, plays an important role in the antifungal activity of the VOCs of S-16 against the growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the thiS gene’s deletion on the 2-MBTH production and to conduct an antimicrobial activity analysis of the Bacillus subtilis S-16. The thiazole-biosynthesis gene was deleted via homologous recombination, after which the contents of 2-MBTH in the wild-type and mutant S-16 strains were analyzed using GC-MS. The antifungal effects of the VOCs were determined using a dual-culture technique. The morphological characteristics of the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum mycelia were examined via scanning-electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, the lesion areas on the sunflower leaves with and without treatment with the VOCs from the wild-type and mutant strains were measured to explore the effects of the VOCs on the virulence of the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Moreover, the effects of the VOCs on the sclerotial production were assessed. We showed that the mutant strain produced less 2-MBTH. The ability of the VOCs produced by the mutant strain to inhibit the growth of the mycelia was also reduced. The SEM observation showed that the VOCs released by the mutant strain also caused more flaccid and gapped hyphae in the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The Sclerotinia sclerotiorum treated by the VOCs produced by the mutant strains caused more damage to the leaves than that treated by the VOCs produced by the wild type and the mutant-strain-produced VOCs inhibited sclerotia formation less. The production of 2-MBTH and its antimicrobial activities were adversely affected to varying degrees by the deletion of thiS. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,562

One of the alternative methods of suppression phytopathogens is the use of biosurfactants, which are amphiphilic substances produced by many microbes. Bacteria of Pseudomonas genus are known to produce biosurfactants of the rhamnolipid class. These surfactants can possess antimicrobial and fungicidal properties. In this work, we studied the effect of various concentrations of rhamnolipid (100, 500, 1000 mg/l), produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain on the growth of fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria spp on tomato leaves that were a) separated from the plants and b) not separated from the plants. On infected separated leaves without biosurfactant treatment, the area covered by Alternaria spp and F. oxysporum was 28% and 8%, respectively. The growth of Alternaria spp was fully inhibited when the leaf spayed with 1000 mg/l rhamnolipid before artificial infection, and of F. oxysporum – with 100 mg/l rhamnolipid. On unseparated biosurfactants-untreated leaves that remained growing on the tomato plants after artificial infection with Alternaria spp and F. oxysporum was 4.7 and 4.2 scores, respectively. Infection of the leaves did not lead to infection of the whole plants since infected leaves were defoliated. Interestingly, biosurfactants treatment led to growth stimulation of tomato plants at a concentration of 1000 mg/l. It can be concluded that rhamnolipid produced by P. aeruginosa PAO1 is a promising biocontrol agent. © 2023 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference. All rights reserved.",NA,563

Particularly, preliminary data on their use as fungicidal agents and plant growth-promoting agents are now available. With these developments, it is expected that copper-based nanofungicides will emerge as “next-generation agrochemicals.” A minimal impact on the environment during the production of nanomaterials will ensure their sustainable applications in the agricultural sector. Copper nanofungicidal formulations have many advantages. Besides providing the necessary antifungal activity, the nanofungicides, with their inherently low concentrations of copper, can benefit plant growth, resulting in increased yields. Furthermore, the associated ecotoxicological risks of nanofungicides are negligible. With the new advances, better and “smarter” nanoformulations tailored to release the active ingredient on demand can be made.

In order to increase the effectiveness of pesticides, active ingredients are mixed with various formulations. The current study tried to determine the effects of pesticides and their mixtures on testicular tissue in rats. For this purpose, chlormequat chloride (CCC), pirimiphos methyl (PMM), glyphosate (GLY), tebuconazole (TBZ), chlorpyrifos methyl (CPM), deltamethrin (DLM), and their mix (acceptable daily intake (ADI) and ADIx10) were administried to Sprague-Dawley rats for 90 days. As a result of the examinations, the ADIx10 group showed the most damaging effect by showing a statistical difference in terms of sperm motility and membrane integrity. The GLY group had a similar effect on membrane integrity as the ADIx10 group, while it had a moderately detrimental effect on motility. Degenerations of spermatocytes, necrosis, and edema in intertubular spaces were observed in all pesticide groups. Similarly, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression and Caspase-3 expression were moderate in all pesticide groups. Moreover, 8-OHdG expression and Caspase-3 expression were higher in the ADI and ADIx10 groups compared to other groups. As a result, pesticides and their mixtures cause histopathological changes in the testicular tissue of rats and decrease sperm quality. © 2023, Hokkaido University. All rights reserved.",NA,566

One of the most pressing difficulties in the agricultural industry is the need to handle pesticide-related issues such as environmental contamination, bioaccumulation, and increases in insect resistance, which necessitates reducing the amount of pesticide sprayed on crops and protecting stored products. Nano-technology is proving to be an appealing tool for achieving this goal since it provides new ways to synthesize and transport active ingredients known as nanopesticides1. Nanoemulsions are particularly well suited to creating lipophilic functional agent delivery systems2. The current study uses a high-energy (ultra-sound) emulsification approach to create oil-in-water (O/W) acetamiprid nanoemulsions with synthetic and natural additives. The acetamiprid nanoemulsions were spontaneously formed by adding a mixture of acetamiprid and solvent in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant (tween) with continuous stirring. The nanoemulsions were then formed by ultra-sonication. Various characterization techniques for acetamiprid nanoemulsions include particle size analysis (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Acetamiprid nanoemulsions are further evaluated by studying thermodynamic stability. This includes a Centrifugation assay, Freeze-thaw cycle nanoemulsions, Heating-cooling test, stability at room temperature of 25°C, pH measurement, and viscosity measurement. The droplet size and morphology of the acetamiprid nanoemulsions were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DLS and TEM measurements showed that acetamiprid nanoemulsions had an almost droplet size distribution (PDI < 200 nm). On this basis, an insecticide acetamiprid was incorporated into an optimized nanoemulsion system to demonstrate potential applications in pest control. © 2023, Clinical Biotec, Universidad Catolica del Oriente (UCO).

While the application knowledge of EOs as an antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, pesticide, and food additive has been properly documented in the literature, gaps still exist in understanding the underlying mechanism of their action on food spoilage and potentially pathogenic microbes. Many bioactive constituents including the volatile secondary compounds vary with the nature of the organic source of EO even though some have been assayed; their antimicrobial validation on an individual basis has not been fully investigated nor their biosynthetic pathways are well established. Although plants, particularly herbs, form the predominant sources of food additives and EOs compared to bacteria algae, and fungi, the potency, concentration composition, and diversity of the active principles vary significantly across plant parts (leaf, seed, flower, bark, and fruits). These notwithstanding, essential oils have also been suspected to impact the release of food nutrients in the digestive tract, normal flora of the gut and intestine for optimal food benefits. Consequently, this study aims to promote a better understanding of the diverse sources from which EOs of food value can be expressed, application trends in food processing, and potential strategies for disarming spoilage, pathogenic, and toxigenic microorganisms, and toxin molecules in food. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluated the efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 sprayed on blocks of different substrates (concrete, mud and plywood) against pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) strains, and wild An. arabiensis. It also assessed the efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 in experimental huts plastered with mud and concrete against wild free-flying An. arabiensis; and non-inferiority to a World Health Organization listed indoor residual spraying product Actellic® 300CS in terms of mortality in Moshi, Tanzania.Monthly cone bioassays on blocks and in experimental huts (against pyrethroid susceptible and resistant An. gambiae s.s.) were conducted over a 12-month period after spraying of VECTRON™ T500 and Actellic® CS300. Collections of wild free-flying An. arabiensis were also done in the sprayed huts. The main outcome for cone bioassays was mortality while for the wild hut trial collections, it was mortality and blood feeding inhibition. Grouped logistic regressions with random effects were used to analyse all dichotomous outcome variables from wild collections.The results showed residual efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 of at least 80% mortality was longest on concrete, followed by plywood and then mud substrates for all mosquito strains. Furthermore, VECTRON™ T500 significantly increased the likelihood of mortality (OR:> 1.37, P<0.001) in wild collections of An. arabiensis compared to Actellic® 300CS. Blood feeding was not significantly different in the wild collection of An. arabiensis between VECTRON™ T500 and Actellic® 300CS arms.These results show that VECTRON™ T500 is efficacious against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.s. and non-inferior to Actellic® 300CS. Therefore, it should be an important addition to the current arsenal of insecticides used for insecticide resistance management and vector control.

However, a few effective and sustainable control methods are currently available. To discover novel and effective management approaches, we screened marine fungi for their antibacterial activity against phytopathogenic bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We screened the culture broth of 55 fungal strains isolated from various marine sources (seawater, algae, and sediment) for their in vitro antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. Then, only the fungal strain (designated UL-Ce9) with higher antibacterial activity in vitro was tested in an in vivo experiment against tomato bacterial wilt. The active compounds of UL-Ce9 were extracted using ethyl acetate, purified by a series of chromatography, and the structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pesticide formulations of toluquinol were prepared as soluble concentrates and wettable powder. The disease control efficacy of toluquinol formulations was evaluated against blight of rice and the bacterial wilt of tomato. Results and discussion: The culture broth of UL-Ce9 showed high antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni in vitro, and we selected UL-Ce9 for the in vivo test. The UL-Ce9 culture broth completely suppressed the bacterial wilt of tomato at a dilution of 1:5. The phylogenetic analysis identified UL-Ce9 as Penicillium griseofulvum, and the antibacterial metabolites were revealed as patulin, gentisyl alcohol, and toluquinol, all of which were associated with the biosynthetic pathway of the mycotoxin patulin. Patulin exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against 16 phytopathogenic bacteria in vitro, followed by toluquinol and gentisyl alcohol. As patulin is toxic, we selected toluquinol to investigate its potential use as a pesticide against bacterial plant diseases. Compared with the chemicals currently being applied in agriculture (streptomycin and oxytetracycline), toluquinol formulations exhibited similar and higher control efficacies against bacterial leaf blight of rice and bacterial wilt of tomato, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antibacterial activity of toluquinol against phytopathogenic bacteria. Our results suggest that toluquinol is a potential candidate for the development of novel and effective pesticides for the management of bacterial plant diseases.

However, knowledge about their environmental interactions is still very limited. In a recent study, efforts were made to compare the soil fate and bioaccumulation of four model nanopesticides (namely, chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole loaded on polymeric and lipid nanocarriers) relative to the conventional formulations and pure active ingredients in containing earthworms and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in two soils over a period of 4 months. These nanoformulations increased the soil half-life of the pesticides by twofold as a direct consequence of the slow release of the pesticide. Pesticide bioaccumulation in earthworms was often increased, probably as a result of their enhanced bioavailability. The pesticide bioaccumulation was also shown to affect plants, but with an inconsistent trend. Overall, the microcosmic results demonstrated that nanoformulations can significantly alter the fate and bioavailability of pesticides. However, generalisations are still difficult to make as the impacts depend on the type of nanocarrier, pesticide, soil used, and time scale. It could only be concluded that this study helped in judging the benefits versus risks of nanopesticides. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",NA,573

Plant essential oils (EOs) have garnered attention as potential insect pest control agents. The current study examines the lethal effects of plant EOs on the Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella Zeller) and the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella (Hübner)). Materials and Methods This study examined the fumigant toxicity of eight Iranian pharmaceutical plant EOs: sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), black cumin (Elwendia persica), Shirazi thyme (Zataria multiflora), costmary (Tanacetum balsamita), galbanum (Ferula gummosa), myrtle (Myrtus communis), lemon (Citrus × limon) and marjoram (Origanum majorana) against eggs, first instar larvae, and adults of P. interpunctella and E. kuehniella. Insects were maintained under controlled conditions at 27 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5% R.H., and a photoperiod of 14L:10D. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to identify the compounds present in the tested plant EOs. The lethal concentration (LC) values were estimated using probit analysis based on data obtained from preliminary and main bioassays. Results The predominant compounds (in term of %) identified in the EOs were as follows: A. annua: Camphor (41.388), 1,8-Cineole (13.431); E. persica: α-Terpinolen (31.622), Limonene (14.524), Propanal, 2-methyl-3-phenyl-(13.180); Z. multiflora: Carvacrol (60.593) and Terbutaline, tris (trimethyl silyl) ether (11.229); T. balsamita: Carvone (42.607), (‒)-Thujone (17.600); F. gummosa: β-Thujene (34.234), β-pinene (22.371); M. communis: δ-3-Carene (30.549), 1,8-Cineole (19.580), Carvacrol (13.987); C. limon: Limonene (55.131), and O. majorana: (‒)-Terpinen-4-ol (34.138), γ-Terpinene (15.494). EOs exhibited comparable ovicidal activity against the eggs of both species. Notably, A. annua EO displayed the highest efficacy, with LC50 values of 58.12 μl/L air for E. kuehniella and 51.55 μl/L air for P. interpunctella. For E. kuehniella, the EOs of M. communis, Z. multiflora, and F. gummosa followed suit in terms of efficacy, while E. persica, O. majorana, T. balsamita, and C. limon EOs demonstrated the lowest ovicidal activity. Conversely, regarding P. interpunctella, the EOs of M. communis, F. gummosa, Z. multiflora and E. persica exhibited the next highest efficacy, whereas T. balsamita, O. majorana, and C. limon EOs displayed the least ovicidal activity. Eggs of P. interpunctella exhibited slightly greater sensitivity compared to those of E. kuehniella. The EOs of M. communis and A. annua demonstrated the highest efficacy against first instar larvae of both species, with estimated LC50 values of 84.19 and 76.64 μl/L air, respectively. Following closely, EOs of A. annua and F. gummosa exhibited notable effectiveness against first instar larvae of E. kuehniella, while EOs of M. communis and Z. multiflora showed similar efficacy against first instar larvae of P. interpunctella. Conversely, the EOs of C. limon, T. balsamita, O. majorana and E. persica displayed the least larvicidal activity against E. kuehniella larvae, whereas the EOs of O. majorana and E. persica demonstrated the lowest efficacy against P. interpunctella larvae. Consistent with the findings concerning the eggs, the first instar larvae of P. interpunctella demonstrated slightly greater sensitivity compared to those of E. kuehniella. The EOs exhibited similar lethal effects against adults of both species. Notably, M. communis EO exhibited the highest lethality against male and female adults of both species, followed by EOs of A. annua, E. persica and Z. multiflora. Conversely, EOs of C. limon, T. balsamita, F. gummosa and O. majorana displayed the least lethal effect. Interestingly, female adults showed greater tolerance compared to male adults. Moreover, similar to the observations with eggs and first instar larvae, adults of P. interpunctella displayed slightly greater sensitivity than those of E. kuehniella. Discussion The study findings highlight the significant lethal effects of various plant EOs, indicating promising alternatives to hazardous chemical pesticides. Iran's rich pharmaceutical plant flora contains diverse compounds, including volatile ones like EOs, which can be explored for their medicinal, insecticidal, fungicidal and other properties. The availability of formulations derived from complete plant EOs or their active components (i.e. insecticides, acaricides, fungicides and herbicides) in the market suggests the potential for developing more potent and environmentally friendly biorational pesticides through dedicated research in this field. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,575

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Methods of analytical analysis of the range of pesticide active substances, which are registered and used in modern systems of grain crop protection in Ukraine, were used in the study. Normative documents of national legislation on hygienic regulation of pesticides and methodological approaches to assessing the combined effects of pesticide mixtures in food products serve as materials for assessment. RESULTS: Results: It is established that the total risk of exposure to residual amounts of pesticides in bread products (wheat and rye bread) during its comparable getting into the body was 0.59 for children 2-6 years and 0.36 - for adults, with an allowable value of ≤ 1.0. The combined effect of pesticides per unit of children's body weight is higher, but also lies within acceptable limits. The largest contribution to the overall risk of combined exposure to triazoles is made by flutriafol (38.5-47.0%), which in the future may be the basis for substantiating measures to reduce such exposure and make appropriate management decisions. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Safety of consumption of agricultural products is ensured by strict following hygienic regulations for the pesticide application (application rates, frequency of treatments, pre-harvest intervals), which makes it impossible to accumulate their residual amounts in food.

The parameters observed were larvae mortality, feeding inhibition activity (antifeedant), and larval development time. The result showed that the combination indexes of the mixed extract of Spiked pepper fruit and Fish-poison bean leaves (1:1) were additive with the value of LC50 and LC95 is 0,29% and 0,59%, respectively. Mixed extract of Spiked pepper fruit and Fish-poison bean leaves (1:1) caused larvae mortality, inhibited feeding activity, and inhibited S. frugiperda larvae growth. The formulation is needed to increase the mixed extract of Spiked pepper fruit and Fish-poison bean leaves (1:1) activity against S. frugiperda. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",NA,581

Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are considered safe for non-target organisms and environmentally benign at currently allowed environmental exposure levels. However, their increased use in recent years has triggered questions about possible adverse outcomes due to low dose chronic exposure in animals and humans. While the toxicity of GBHs has primarily been attributed to glyphosate, other largely unstudied components of GBHs may be inherently toxic or could act synergistically with glyphosate. Thus, comparative studies of glyphosate and GBHs are needed to parse out their respective toxicity. Methods: We performed such a comparative screen using pure glyphosate and two popular GBHs at the same glyphosate acid equivalent concentrations in the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica. This planarian has been shown to be a useful model for both ecotoxicology and neurotoxicity/developmental neurotoxicity studies. Effects on morphology and various behavioral readouts were obtained using an automated screening platform, with assessments on day 7 and day 12 of exposure. Adult and regenerating planarians were screened to allow for detection of developmentally selective effects. Results: Both GBHs were more toxic than pure glyphosate. While pure glyphosate induced lethality at 1 mM and no other effects, both GBHs induced lethality at 316 μM and sublethal behavioral effects starting at 31.6 μM in adult planarians. These data suggest that glyphosate alone is not responsible for the observed toxicity of the GBHs. Because these two GBHs also include other active ingredients, namely diquat dibromide and pelargonic acid, respectively, we tested whether these compounds were responsible for the observed effects. Screening of the equivalent concentrations of pure diquat dibromide and pure pelargonic acid revealed that the toxicity of either GBH could not be explained by the active ingredients alone. Discussion: Because all compounds induced toxicity at concentrations above allowed exposure levels, our data indicates that glyphosate/GBH exposure is not an ecotoxicological concern for D. japonica planarians. Developmentally selective effects were not observed for all compounds. Together, these data demonstrate the usefulness of high throughput screening in D. japonica planarians for assessing various types of toxicity, especially for comparative studies of several chemicals across different developmental stages.

Citral, carvacrol, and thymol were selected due to their lower EC50 values and formed a compound with each other, respectively. The compound composed of carvacrol and thymol was considered the most excellent pairing with the best inhibitory effect against F.g. in vitro. Additionally, the mass ratio of carvacrol and thymol in the compound was optimized and finalized the formulation of natural compound fungicide. Results showed that when the mass ratio of carvacrol and thymol was 1∶2, the fungicide had the best antifungal effect against F.g. and the synergistic index (S.I.) is 1.45, which showed a synergistic effect. The possible antifungal mechanisms of carvacrol and thymol compound were also analyzed. The prepared natural compound fungicide could change the permeability of F.g.’s cell membrane, reflected by the change in conductivity. Furthermore, the effects of the prepared natural compounded fungicide on wheat coleoptiles against F.g. were studied. It could significantly inhibit the growth of lesions on wheat coleoptiles. When fungicide (200 μg/mL) was administered to wheat coleoptiles infected by F.g., the control rate of the protective group and the curative group were 79.08% and 84.54%, respectively.

According to their target, they are mainly herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. Pesticides include many very diverse active substances, with natural formulations, such as copper sulphate, or socalled synthetic pesticides from the chemical industry. These substances cover more than 80 chemical families or classes characterized by various properties, selected to meet the objective of combating the pests. The use of pesticides is the main solution to crop pests worldwide, despite their unsustainability due to the environmental and human damage they cause. This observation is particularly striking in emerging and developing countries, as is the case for agriculture in Morocco and specifically in the region of TangierTetouan-Al Hoceima. The objective of this review is to analyze the distribution of retailers of pesticides for agricultural use at the national, regional, and provincial level, pesticides placed on the market, types of packaging, repackaging, as well as supply channels, distribution, and sale to carry out a thorough investigation of the most used plant protection products in the Loukkos area. The second part contains an analysis of the evolution of the Moroccan regulations on pesticides for agricultural use. However, the substances used vary over time due to frequent changes in marketing authorizations for the different possible uses of pesticides, and also differentially depending on the regions of the world. As the uses of certain substances are restricted or banned, most often as a result of new knowledge of their harmful impact on the environment or on public health, progress chemicals allow others to be put on the market to replace them. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,584

Management of the current agricultural problems using modern nanotechnology-based methods is need to be implemented so that the overall crop losses can be minimized. The disadvantages of using synthetic agrochemicals and fertilizers are nonspecific killing of beneficial microbes or insects or pests, high cost, and threat to human health and environment. With the intervention of nanotechnology in agriculture (agro-nanotechnology), site-specific targeted delivery, and controlled release of the agrochemicals and fertilizers (plant nutrients) were achieved which led to the increment in plant growth and uptake of nutrients. Also, agro-nanotechnology can be a potent substitute to mitigate the issues in agriculture field in a sustainable manner. The potential application of agro-nanotechnology leads to the development of nano-pesticides, nano-insecticides, nano-herbicides, nano-fungicides, and nano-fertilizers. Thus, the replacement of the traditional agricultural practices with agro-nanotechnology is a novel alternative to enhance crop production, control pests, insects and microbes for minimizing pre- and post-harvesting damages. Nanomaterials offer unique properties as carriers and formulations to facilitate targeted delivery and crop protection against phytopathogens leading to the development of high-tech agricultural farms. These nanoformulations use small quantities of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, and botanicals to target specific pathogens and exert minimum impact on the environment ensuring biosafety. Besides, pesticide and insecticide-based nanoformulations, botanical-based nanoformulations like rotenone-loaded zein NPs, limonene-loaded zein NPs, and carvacrol-loaded zein NPs have been reported previously as potent antimicrobials against phytopathogens like P. syringae and F. oxysporum. Thus, scaling up the developed nanoformulations would be the future target to provide solutions to agriculture-related problems in a sustainable manner.

In this study, microemulsion formulations of cypermethrin insecticide were designed to control Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), one of the important pests of many crops and ornamental plants. Xylene was selected as a suitable solvent based on the higher solubility of cypermethrin. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed by the water titration method. The microemulsion system using mixtures composed of cypermethrin, Kenon 10+SDS surfactants, and 1-butanol cosurfactant had the highest microemulsion surface, and the ratio of 50:30:20 was chosen for further experiments. The physical and chemical properties of the obtained microemulsions were also evaluated. Microemulsion formulations were synthesized with 150 and 250 g/L a.i. (active ingredient) of the cypermethrin. The appearance of the microemulsion compounds was transparent and the droplet size of all samples was less than 35 nm.

Dangshansuli pear is always affected by the superficial scald disorder, causing serious economic losses. Superficial scald, a physiological disorder that causes the appearance of irregular browning or black patches on the skin of some pear and apple cultivars, generally occurs after several months of cold storage and rapidly worsens when fruits are transferred to room temperature. Although superficial scald does not affect fruit flesh, it severely affects the appearance quality and commodity value. The post-storage quality of fruit must be maintained or enhanced to meet the increasing demands of consumers and market competition. The natural antioxidant pterostilbene (Pte) in plants plays an important role in inhibiting fruit disorders, but due to the lack of emulsifiers when fruits are treated, it is difficult to spread fully on and adsorb by the fruit, thus affecting its medicinal effect. This study aims to explore the optimal formulation of pterostilbene emulsifiable (Pte EC), and find the effects of it, Pte and Diphenylamine (DPA) on the post-harvest pear fruit storage quality and superficial scald control to explore whether Pte EC can improve the efficacy and replace the application of DPA in production, and provide a certain theoretical basis for the prevention of superficial scald in the future. 【Methods】In this study, the solvent and emulsifier of the preparation were screened with pterostilbene as the active ingredient, and then the emulsion quality was determined. Finally the optimum formula of 10% pterostilbene emulsifiable (Pte EC) was determined. On this basis, the Dangshansuli pear fruits were used as the experimental materials, which were harvested in September 2020 in the commercial orchard of Tongchuan county, Shaanxi province. Fruits with the same maturity and similar size, as well as without pests, diseases and mechanical damage were selected during harvesting, and transported back to Shaanxi Huasheng Fruit Industry on the same day. The next day, each of the treatments was carried out: In 2500 μL·L-1 DPA aqueous solution, fruits were soaked for 2 minutes; In 10 mg·L-1 Pte aqueous solution, fruits were treated for 2 min; In 10% Pte EC diluted into 10 mg · L- 1 aqueous solution, fruits were treated for 2 min. After processing, the fruits were packed in a carton with a plastic foam screen and stored in a cold storage [storage temperature: (-1.0±0.5) ℃, RH 90%-95%]. Twelve fruits were randomly selected every 30 days during cold storage, and each treatment was repeated for three times. Immediately after taking pears back to the laboratory to determine the fruit quality index, the peel and pulp were ground with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ℃ for further analysis. The indicators included hardness, soluble solids content, titrable acid content, malondialdehyde content, DPPH free radical scavenging capability and hydrogen peroxide content. In addition, superficial scald related indicators also included superficial scald incidence, disease index, α-fanneene and conjugated triene contents. Then the effects of diphenylamine (DPA), Pte and Pte EC were studied on the fruit quality after refrigeration and shelf life.【Results】(1) In the current research, the best combination of absolute ethanol and Tween 20 were selected from 6 solvents and 10 emulsifiers that could meet the requirements of food safety. When Tween 20 was used as the emulsifier to prepare Pte EC, the solution was automatically dispersed in a mist. And after stirring, it became a blue and clear emulsion, without floating oil on the top and sediment on the bottom. The emulsification dispersion effect was perfect and could meet the national standards. The emulsion stability, heat storage stability and cold storage stability were also qualified. (2) DPA, Pte, and Pte EC treatments could delay the decline of pear fruit firmness during cold storage and had the effect of maintaining the freshness of fruits. (3) DPA, Pte and Pte EC treatments can effectively inhibit the accumulation of H2O2, MDA and conjugated triene in pear peel during cold storage, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of superficial scald of Dangshansuli pear (p＜0.05). When pear fruits were stored up to 210 days, the incidence of fruit with three treatments was 28.69%, 12.19% and 15.32% lower than that of the control, respectively. (4) The controlling effect of Pte EC on pear superficial scald was second only to the DPA level, which was better than that of Pte treatment.【Conclusion】The preferred formula of 10% Pte EC finalized in this study is 10% pterostilbene + 10% Tween 20 + 80% absolute ethanol, and the performance of this formulation meets the national pesticide formulation standards. The formula is green environmental protection and safe, and improves the efficacy of Pte, which can improve the fruit quality and delay the fruit senescence to a certain extent. Simultaneously, Pte EC can effectively control the superficial scald of Dangshansuli pear. This study provides not only a new idea for the prevention of superficial scald, but also a theoretical basis for further Pte EC commercial application. © 2023 Journal of Fruit Science.

It is critical to have accurate predictions of the VDSD for development of new agrochemicals and spray nozzles. VDSD parameterization and subsequent prediction is complicated in agrochemical sprays by the unique geometries of the nozzles employed, which typically do not have clearly evident hydraulic diameters and vary in size, as well as by the effects of active herbicides and adjuvants on the spray. Herein, scaling based on conservation of energy is utilized to develop a relationship predicting the VDSD for flat fan sprays used in agrochemical application with agrochemical products. To examine the proposed scaling relationship, we made measurements of VDSDs using laser diffraction interferometry for agriculturally relevant tank mixtures, including active pesticides and both emulsion-forming and rheology-modifying drift control adjuvants, sprayed with complex geometry, flat fan nozzles typical of field application. We show that for three distinct nozzle types and three tank mixtures (nine combinations), VDSDs can be normalized by the Sauter mean diameter (D32), and normalized distributions collapse for given nozzle type–spray tank mix combination. Subsequently, we show for all test combinations that the Sauter mean diameter normalized by the nozzle hydraulic diameter (DH) scales with the ratio of product of tank mix surface tension and hydraulic diameter divided by the nozzle pressure drop, with a scaling exponent of 1/3. © 2023 by Begell House, Inc.",NA,592

This study details a laboratory evaluation of broflanilide, of putative discriminating concentrations, potential cross-resistance, and residual efficacy on two substrates. Methods: Mosquitoes were exposed to broflanilide in bottle bioassays to determine lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC95). These were used to calculate resistance ratios between the susceptible Kisumu and the pyrethroid-resistant Muleba-Kis strains of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Prototype wettable powder formulations of broflanilide were applied to mud and concrete to determine the optimal observation period for determining delayed mortality, and a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to determine a potential dose response effect. Subsequently, residual efficacy of application rates ranging between 25 mg/m2 and 300 mg/m2 were monitored monthly. Results: LC values of tested strains were not significantly different; therefore, the polyfactorial resistance mechanisms possessed by the resistant strain did not confer resistance to broflanilide. A significant effect of concentration and time since spraying was found on mosquito survival, indicating that higher broflanilide concentrations are more effective and that this effect was strongest immediately after spraying. Knockdown at 60min post exposure was negligible, with on average only 1% of all mosquitoes knocked down. On the mud surface, but not on concrete, there was a delayed killing effect, with mortality increasing until 72 hours after exposure. The residual efficacy test indicated that on concrete the 100 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2 concentrations of both broflanilide 50WP formulations remained efficacious for 9 months post spraying. On mud, there were large variations in mosquito mortality from month to month. Generally, higher concentrations resulted in higher mortality, despite variation over time. Discussion: Cross-resistance to broflanilide was not detected in mosquitoes with multiple resistance mechanisms. This opens up the possibility for wide-scale use of broflanilide, especially in areas with established pyrethroid resistance. Like some other insecticide classes, delayed mortality up to 72 hours post exposure was found for broflanilide. Promising residual efficacy was found with broflanilide 50WP formulations on concrete. On mud, efficacy varied and further testing with a refined formulation is recommended. Copyright © 2023 Snetselaar, Rowland, Azizi, Mawa, Malone and Kirby.",NA,593

Despite their direct release to soils and crops, there is currently no inventory of used polymers and their fate in soils is poorly studied and understood. Herein, we identify WSPs and WDPs used in agricultural formulations on the German and Swiss markets. By searching the scientific literature, patents, and manufacturer websites, we tentatively identified that 233 of the 1815 listed trade names of formulation additives contained polymers, the majority of which belonged to three main chemical classes: polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based (co)polymers, functionalized polysaccharides (PSacs), and vinylic (co)polymers (VCPs). We report information on their functionalization, molecular weights, and market significance. In 2015, their estimated combined annual application volume in Switzerland surpassed 100 tonnes. Low molecular weight PEGs and natural, unfunctionalized PSacs reportedly biodegrade, suggesting no accumulation in soils associated with their use as formulation additives. Conversely, high molecular weight functionalized PEGs, functionalized PSacs, and the majority of the VCPs have been reported to undergo only slow or no soil biodegradation. These polymers may thus persist and accumulate in agricultural soils, requiring more detailed investigations of their environmental fate and resulting exposure scenarios. There is a need for systematic studies on the effects of polymer structure, molecular weight, and functionalization on soil biodegradability. © 2023 Swiss Chemical Society.

Mass spectrometry, a common tool used by plant biologists, is unable to resolve nano-crystalline active ingredients (AIs) on the leaf surface nor achieve 3D molecular imaging of living plants. To address that, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) are combined to achieve sub-cellular, depth-resolved fluorescence lifetime of both AIs and intrinsic proteins/pigments (e.g., chlorophyll and/or cytosolic NADH) after the herbicide treatment application.

Additionally, to measure the herbicide-induced cellular-level functional responses within living plant tissues, 3D time-resolved molecular MPM-FLIM imaging of hemp dogbane leaf with herbicide is performed. Results demonstrate MPM-FLIM is capable of 3D simultaneous functional imaging of label-free living plant tissues and the quantitative measurements of the location and formation of AI nano-crystals within the plant tissues. © 2023 SPIE.",NA,595

They might be striking alternatives to synthetic herbicides. In the present study, actinobacteria strains were isolated from soil samples and their herbicidal activities were screened. In the screening, Streptomyces sp. strain KR0005 broth culture exhibited the highest phytotoxic activity. Thus, it was selected for further studies. The herbicidal active compound purified from this selected strain was identified as cycloheximide (MW, 281.; C15H23NO4) based on 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 2D-NMR, and high-resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry analyses. Dose–response experiments revealed that the GR50 value of Digitaria ciliaris was 1.37 g L−1 to Streptomyces sp. strain KR0005 culture filtrate. In general, the inclusion of v/v 0.1% of LES270 (Alcohols, (C12-14), ethoxylated, mono ethers with sulphuric acid, sodium salts) and SF90 (Alcohols, C12-14-secondary, ethoxylated) surfactants resulted in a 14.3% decrease and a 24.1% increase in herbicidal activity, respectively, compared with Tween-20 (Polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate). Mode of action experiments revealed that the KR0005 culture filtrate acted as both photosynthesis and cell membrane integrity inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. However, further studies such as mutation and/or specific culture conditions are needed to increase the herbicidal activity of this selected strain. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,596

However, this may affect the material structure and charge distribution. Alternatively, zeolites may be synthesized at a high cost and time-consuming process. Consequently, new methods, such as the hydrothermal method, for NZ modification needs to be studied. In this sense, a novel surface-modified zeolite (SMZ), using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in acid media was produced by the hydrothermal method and applied for the adsorption of Atrazine (ATZ), Diuron (DIU) and 2,4-D. Commercial NZ and SMZ were characterized by SEM, XRD, TGA, FT-IR, AA spectroscopy, pHPZC, Zeta potential and N2-physisorption. The SMZ chosen for the adsorption experiments was the one with the highest modification yield and adsorption capacity obtained from a complete design of experiments (CTAB=0.74; D=12 Mesh; HCl=0.1 M; t=6 h and T=205 ºC). The adsorption experiments revealed that the SMZ adsorption capacity for the herbicide 2,4-D (qmax=9.02 mg/g) was greater than that obtained for ATZ (qmax=2.11 mg/g) and DIU (qmax=1.85 mg/g), which was explained by the presence of the hydroxyl group and by geometric characteristics of the 2,4-D. Adsorption models’ fitting showed that the adsorption of 2,4-D onto SMZ were best described by pseudo-second order kinetic (k2=0.005-0.006 g/mg.min; qe,exp=7.122-8.614 mg/g) and Langmuir isothermal model (KL=0.283-0.499 L/mg; qm=7.167-7.995 mg/g).

The entomopahogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana plays a key role in the management of various veterinary, forestry, and agricultural arthropod pests. However, the use of entomopathogenic fungi as biocontrol agents is less expensive and safer. Beauveria formulated in liquid or dry formulations with large numbers of aerial conidia are typically deployed in a wide range of applications in a chemical paradigm. Solid-state fermentation has emerged as an appropriate technology for the mass production of Beauveria to yield hydrophobic aerial conidia, the principal active ingredients of mycoinsecticides. An effective production methodology that can be easily adopted involves the use of different media such as wheat bran, rice bran, Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), and sorghum, which were used as substrates for mass multiplication of B. bassiana. Organic media, nonsynthetic media, and the biomass of fungal grain media can also be used for production. The economics of B. bassiana were evaluated based on the final yield. However, worldwide production of fungal spores that demand low inputs was carried out using simple technologies while considering the aspect of production and cost-benefit analysis as well as marketing of B. bassiana, targeting the basis of entrepreneurship. Hence, this book chapter was designed to provide an overview of the mass cultivation of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana on locally available agricultural and industrial waste to decrease the production cost and to increase the cost-benefit ratio for the production of virulent spores, i.e., solid and liquid media, and to accelerate the commercialization of B. bassiana. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.",NA,598

Specifically, the study found that the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides led to an increase in the levels of anionic surfactants (ASA) in the soil. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of fertilizers and pesticides had a greater effect on ASA levels than either factor alone. The use of pesticides also led to an increase in non-ionic surfactants (NSA), while the use of fertilizers resulted in a decrease in NSA levels. The study also found that the increase in the levels of mobile forms of key nutrients in the soil was associated with the accumulation of ASA in lower layers of the soil profile.The amount of alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen under the low protection system increased by 3.0–23.2 mg kg-1 soil, mobile phosphorus by 14.0–144.0 mg P2O5, and exchangeable potassium by 9.0–222.0 mg K2O per kg soil, compared to the control. With the complex use of fertilizers and pesticides in one block, a trend of increasing mobile forms of nutrients in the soil was observed. The distribution of ASA amount in the soil profile is descending. The clear presence of ASA was established only in the soil layer of 0–40 cm. An increase of ASA content in the soil due to the use of agrochemicals and fertilizers is observed up to a depth of 60–80 cm.

By contrast, farmers still rely on synthetic chemical pesticides to control pests. The shift from synthetic chemical insecticides to botanical insecticides or bioinsecticides is quite complex, especially in Indonesia. Farmers must have the appropriate technology to be independent of synthetic chemical insecticide. This study aims to test the effectiveness of organic adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of insecticides coupled with chlorpyrifos as an active ingredient. We tested the organic adjuvants containing sulfur, acetic acid, NaCl and aqueous extract of Azadirachta indica leaves. The test involved mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.) plant on land with a high record of S. litura attacks. The study followed a randomized block design with 8 treatments and 5 blocks, with each block consisting of 20 test plants. The treatments involved water control, chlorpyrifos insecticide at recommended concentration, and a combination of chlorpyrifos insecticide and organic adjuvant. The results showed that the combination of insecticides and organic adjuvants did not have a negative impact on mustard growth, as evinced by the absence of significant difference in all treatments. Furthermore, the combination of insecticides and organic adjuvants reduced the rate of plant damage, the population of S. litura and the population of other insect pests. On the other hand, the combination of insecticides and organic adjuvants did not significantly affect the number of beneficial insects compared with treatment without insecticides. The study documented that the combination of 40 mL L-1 organic adjuvant + 1.8 mL L-1 insecticide chlorpyrifos led to the best results. This combination is found the most effective in reducing plant damage and pest population, without any negative impact on beneficial insects.

The results of the formulation characterization have shown that all the formulations were stable at 25°C for 8weeks and 54°C for 1month. All formulations have a particle size of less than 100nm, PDI of 0.108–0.415, surface tension below 30mN/m, viscosity less than 60mPas, zeta potentials less than 40mV, and pH less than 6.00. TEM micrographs confirmed the spherical shape of nanoemulsions having particle sizes below 100nm as measured using the Malvern Zetasizer instrument. The results for the antifungal assay of the formulations (in vitro) showed a percentage inhibition of radial mycelial growth and conidial germination of the fungus. The results showed 100% of percentage inhibition of radial growth (PIRG) for F12, F13, F14, F15, F7, F8, F9, and F10 at 5% and 10% of the active ingredient concentration and 100% of percentage inhibition of spore growth (PISG) at 10% for F13 and F14 formulations. Similarly, the micrographs from SEM and TEM revealed irreversible surface and ultrastructural alterations in the conidia and mycelia of the fungus. The changes observed were aggregation, abnormal growth, lysis, reduced hyphal diameter and length, disruption of the entire organelles within the cell, cell wall permeability, and irregular cell wall shape compared to the control. This research has confirmed the antifungal activity of nanoemulsions and suggested that M. oleifera is a good candidate that could be used for biocontrol of Botrytis cinerea fungus, thereby reducing farmers’ overdependence on synthetic fungicides and saving the environment from deterioration. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the current study was to identify two fungi isolated from tomato plants cultivated in greenhouses, with symptoms of leaf mould disease and a strain of the genus Cladosporium from a culture collection, and evaluate their in vitro susceptibility to four commercial fungicides. Macro and microscopic examination, molecular characterisation and sequence analysis were applied for identification. Broth dilution and spread plate methods were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicide concentration (MFC). The active ingredients of the products were azoxystrobin+difenoconazole, trifloxystrobin+tebuconazole, chlorothalonil and metalaxyl-M+mancozeb. The results were processed using the Kruskal-Wallis method. The isolates were identified as Cladosporium cladosporioidesa-c; consequently, lesions found on tomato plants did not correspond to Cladosporium fulvum. There was a significant statistical difference between the obtained values. Qualitatively, the three strains had a similar behaviour for chlorothalonil (MIC values: 0.25 - 0.5 μg/ml, MFC values: 4 μg/ml). In all cases, tests with metalaxyl-M+mancozeb yielded higher values than those achieved for chlorothalonil (MIC values: 8 μg/ml, MFC values: 8- 32 μg/ml). trobilurin-formulated fungicides were less effective against C. cladosporioidesa-b (MIC values: 16-256 μg/ml, MFC values: >64 μg/ml).

These include especially economically important secondary metabolites which are sources of drugs, fragrances, aromatic compounds, pigments, plant-based pesticides, and some food additives. These natural compounds are substitutes for synthetic compounds due to their low production cost and are environmentally friendly. In this chapter, we present various molecular biologic approaches including tissue culture and genome-editing tools that may be used to exploit plant biologically important compounds. Various strategies have been used to enhance plant metabolite production, including increasing substrate availability, regulating key biosynthetic pathways genes, engineering of multigene, combining genetic engineering and elicitation, using various transcription factors (TFs), and introduction of novel genes. Pathway elucidation and metabolic engineering have been useful to get an enhanced yield of the metabolite of interest or for producing novel metabolites. Heterologous expression of putative plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes in plants is useful to validate their functions and, in some cases, also, to produce valuable plant metabolites in other plants. Increasing substrate accessibility, controlling key biosynthesis pathway genes, designing multigenes, integrating genetic modification and elaboration, employing multiple signalling molecules (such as TFs), and introducing novel genes have all been utilized to improve plant metabolite manufacturing. Mechanism understanding as well as biotechnological applications has been used to produce large quantities of a target molecule or to create new compounds. Heterologous expression of suspected biologically active compound biosynthesis genes in plants is beneficial for validating their roles as well as producing valuable secondary bioactive components in other plants in some circumstances.

This growing concern has steered the focus towards the development and research of nano formulations, which promise effective pest control with substantially reduced pesticide concentrations. These new formulations, which allow for controlled delivery of active ingredients, are demonstrating effectiveness comparable to traditional pesticides, but with less environmental impact. However, it is important to acknowledge that these nano-pesticides still contain certain organic groups which are structurally complex and not easily degradable. These elements can persist in the environment, accumulating and becoming more concentrated through the food chain, potentially causing a range of environmental hazards over time. Encouragingly, research has identified that specific bacterial genera including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Burkholderia and among others, have the unique ability to break down certain chemical groups present in these pesticides, using them as a sole source of carbon or nitrogen. This process transforms them into non-harmful end products, marking a promising step towards bioremediation. Currently, efforts are being made to develop this into a viable large-scale solution, exploring different combinations of nano-pesticides and bacteria strains under optimized conditions.

In this work, capsaicin, an irritant alkaloid from hot chili peppers, and hydroxytyrosol, a phenolic compound obtained from extra-virgin olive oil by-products, were loaded into innovative nanocarriers. These were designed ad hoc combining exopolysaccharides from the cyanobacteria Neocyanospira capsulata, and a lipid component, i.e., egg phosphatidylcholine. The polysaccharide was chosen for chemical affinity with the chitin of insect exoskeleton, while the lipids were introduced to modulate the carrier rigidity. The newly formed nanosystems were characterized by physico-chemical techniques and tested for their possible use in pest control programs.

Among the essential plant nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) are the most important and abundantly used nutrients. However, the use efficiency of these nutrients is very low. There is clear evidence that the low use efficiency of N correlates with other application rates in the agricultural sector. Therefore excess application results in more losses and, potentially, enhanced negative environmental consequences. Hence, strategies to enhance NPK and micronutrient use efficiencies through the development of smart fertilizer or delivery systems are greatly needed. Nanotechnology has been visualized as a rapidly evolving field, which has the potential to revolutionize the agriculture and food sector. Nanofertilizers have recently been explored extensively for this purpose.

The GLY group had a similar effect on membrane integrity as the ADIx10 group, while it had a moderately detrimental effect on motility. Degenerations of spermatocytes, necrosis, and edema in intertubular spaces were observed in all pesticide groups. Similarly, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression and Caspase-3 expression were moderate in all pesticide groups. Moreover, 8-OHdG expression and Caspase-3 expression were higher in the ADI and ADIx10 groups compared to other groups.

Both negative centromere micronuclei (MNC-) as DNA damage were induced by the concentrations of TB assayed, suggesting a mostly clastogenic effect. The results obtained from the comet assay suggest that part of the endogenous DNA damage in the HEp-2 cell line could be repaired in presence of low TB concentrations by promoting the damage response.

Use of conventional chemical in-secticides to control mosquito vectors has led to the development of biological resistance in them along with adverse environmental consequences. In this light, the recent years have witnessed enormous efforts of re-searchers to develop eco-friendly and cost-effective alternatives with special emphasis on plant-derived mos-quitocidal compounds. Neem oil, derived from neem seeds (Azadirachta indica A. Juss, Meliaceae), has been proved to be an excellent candidate against a wide range of vectors of medical and veterinary importance including mosquitoes. It is environment-friendly, and target-specific at the same time. The active ingredients of neem oil include limonoids like azadirachtin A, nimbin, salannin and numerous other substances that are still waiting to be discovered. Of these, azadirachtin has been shown to be very effective and is mainly responsible for its toxic effects. The quality of the neem oil depends on its azadirachtin content which, in turn, depends on its manufacturing process. Neem oil can be used directly or as nanoemulsions or nanoparticles or even in the form of effervescent tablets. When added to natural breeding habitat waters they exert their mosquitocidal effects by acting as ovicides, larvicides, pupicides and/or oviposition repellents. The effects are generated by impairing the physiological pathways of the immature stages of mosquitoes or directly by causing physical deformities that impede their development. Neem oil when used directly has certain disadvantages mainly related to its disin-tegration under atmospheric conditions rendering it ineffective. However, many of its formulations have been reported to remain stable under environmental conditions retaining its efficiency for a long time. Similarly, neem seed cake has also been found to be effective against the mosquito vectors. The greatest advantage is that the target species do not develop resistance against neem-based products mainly because of the innumerable number of chemicals present in neem and their combinations. This makes neem-based products highly potential yet unexplored candidates of mosquito control agents. The current review helps to elucidate the roles of neem oil and its various derivatives on mosquito vectors of public health concern.",NA,630

Our objective was to identify options for pesticide reduction using farmer records from 2549 commercial apple fields in Austria during five years between 2010 and 2016. Using generalized additive mixed modeling, we examined how pesticide use was related to farm management, apple varieties, and meteorological parameters, and how it affected yields and toxicity to honeybees. Apple fields received 29.5 +/- 8.6 (mean +/- SD) pesticide applications per season at a rate of 56.7 +/- 22.7 kg ha-1, which included a total of 228 pesticide products with 80 active ingredients. Over the years, fungicides accounted for 71 % of the pesticide amounts applied, insecticides for 15 %, and herbicides for 8 %. The most frequently used fungicides were sulfur (52 %), followed by captan (16 %) and dithianon (11 %). Of insecticides, paraffin oil (75 %) and chlorpyrifos/chlorpyrifos-methyl (6 % combined) were most frequently used. Among herbicides, glyphosate (54 %), CPA (20 %) and pendimethalin (12 %) were most often used. Pesticide use increased with increasing frequency of tillage and fertilization, increasing field size, increasing spring temperatures, and drier summer conditions. Pesticide use decreased with increasing number of summer days with maximum temperatures >30 degrees C and number of warm, humid days. Apple yields were significantly pos-itively related to the number of heat days, warm humid nights, and pesticide treatment frequency, but were not affected by frequency of fertilization and tillage. Honeybee toxicity was not related to insecticide use. Pesticide use and yield were sig-nificantly related to apple varieties. Our analysis shows that pesticide use in the apple farms studied can be reduced by less fertilization and tillage, partly because yields were >50 % higher than the European average. However, weather extremes related to climate change, such as drier summers, could challenge plans to reduce pesticide use.",NA,631

Synthetic fungicides have been employed to manage plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi but their use has been criticized due to unfavorable side effects. As alternative strategies, botanical fungicides have caught the interest of many re-searchers in recent years. There are numerous experimental studies on the fungicidal activities of phytochemicals against phytopathogenic fungi, but there is not a thorough review article that summarizes these experimental studies. The purpose of this review is therefore to consolidate data from in vitro and in vivo studies on the antifungal activity of phytochemicals reported by various researchers. This paper describes antifungal activities of plant extracts and compounds against phytopathogenic fungi, approved botanical fungicides, their benefits, obstacles and mitigation strategies. Relevant sources were collected using online data bases such as Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct, and comprehensively reviewed for preparation of this manuscript. This review revealed that phytochemicals are effective to manage plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi. Botanical fungicides are endowed with benefits such as resis-tance inhibition, being ecofriendly, effective, selective, and more affordable compared to syn-thetic fungicides. However, there are only small number of approved botanical fungicides due to the many challenges that hinder their adoption and utilization for a wider scale production. Farmers' reluctance, lack of standardized formulation techniques, strict legislation, rapid degradation, and other factors hinder their adoption and utilization. The ways to address these challenges include increasing awareness among farmers, conducting more research to identify potential plants with fungicidal properties, standardizing extraction and formulation techniques, implementing the idea of plant breeding to increase bioactive agents, identifying favorable en-vironments for site-specific plant species production, discovering synthetic analogues of the active ingredient to maintain quality standards, establishing reasonable regulation procedures and price points for a quicker market introduction. To put all these into practice, we recommend collaboration of regulatory agencies and researchers from a variety of fields.",NA,633

Quantification of all trace organics in the biological fluids seems impossible and costly, regardless of the high individual exposure vari-ability. We hypothesized that the blood concentration (CB) of organic pollutants could be predicted via their exposure and chemical properties. Developing a prediction model on the annotation of chemicals in human blood can provide new insight into the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of chemicals in humans.OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict blood concentrations (CBs) of chemicals and prioritize chemi-cals of health concern.METHODS: We curated the CBs of compounds mostly measured at population levels and developed an ML model for chemical CB predictions by con-sidering chemical daily exposure (DE) and exposure pathway indicators (dij), half-lives (t1=2), and volume of distribution (Vd). Three ML models, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were compared. The toxicity potential or prioriti-zation of each chemical was represented as a bioanalytical equivalency (BEQ) and its percentage (BEQ%) estimated based on the predicted CB and ToxCast bioactivity data. We also retrieved the top 25 most active chemicals in each assay to further observe changes in the BEQ% after the exclusion of the drugs and endogenous substances. RESULTS: We curated the CBs of 216 compounds primarily measured at population levels. RF outperformed the ANN and SVF models with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.66 and 2.07 lM, the mean absolute error (MAE) values of 1.28 and 1.56 lM, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.29 and 0.23, and R2 of 0.80 and 0.72 across test and testing sets. Subsequently, the human CBs of 7,858 ToxCast chemicals were suc-cessfully predicted, ranging from 1.29 x 10-6 to 1.79 x 10-2 lM. The predicted CBs were then combined with ToxCast in vitro bioassays to prioritize the ToxCast chemicals across 12 in vitro assays with important toxicological end points. It is interesting that we found the most active compounds to be food additives and pesticides rather than widely monitored environmental pollutants.DISCUSSION: We have shown that the accurate prediction of ""internal exposure"" from ""external exposure"" is possible, and this result can be quite use-ful in the risk prioritization. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11305",NA,634

As they are not designed to target insects, the mechanisms behind potential impacts of these pesticides are unclear. It is therefore important to understand their influence at a range of levels, including sublethal impacts on behaviours such as learning. We used the proboscis extension reflex (PER) paradigm to assess how the herbicide glyphosate and the fungicide prothioconazole affect bumblebee olfactory learning. We also assessed responsiveness, and compared the impacts of these active ingredients and their respective commercial formulations (Roundup Biactive and Proline). We found that learning was not impaired by either formulation but, of the bees that displayed evidence of learning, exposure to prothioconazole active ingredient increased learning level in some situations, while exposure to glyphosate active ingredient resulted in bumblebees being less likely to respond to antennal stimulation with sucrose. Our data suggest that fungicides and herbicides may not negatively impact olfactory learning ability when bumblebees are exposed orally to fieldrealistic doses in a lab setting, but that glyphosate has the potential to cause changes in responsiveness in bees. As we found impacts of active ingredients and not commercial formulations, this suggests that co-formulants may modify impacts of active ingredients in the products tested on olfactory learning without being toxic themselves. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, and to evaluate the implications of behavioural changes caused by glyphosate and prothioconazole for bumblebee fitness.",NA,635

Regression analysis found no differences in mortality slopes between positively charged zein nanoparticles loaded with methoxyfenozide [(+)ZNP(MFZ)] and Intrepid 2F, suggesting comparable efficacy of the synthesized nanoparticles to a commercial product. Higher concentrations of MFZ were present in (+)ZNP(MFZ)-treated in leaf tissue at 3 d following spray when compared to Intrepid 2F.

Therefore, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of mesotrione (MES) and rimsulfuron plus thifensulfuron-methyl (RIMTHIF) in tank mixtures with five adjuvants sprayed with three different nozzle types, XR (Extended Range), AIXR (Air Induction Extended Range), and TTI (Turbo TeeJet Induction), on weed control.

A dose-response study using MES and RIMTHIF was conducted to estimate the effective dose to reduce the aboveground biomass by 50% from the nontreated control (ED50). Another study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of MES and RIMTHIF in tank mixtures with five adjuvants (ammonium sulfate - AMS, crop oil concentrate - COC, drift reducing adjuvant - DRA, methylated seed oil - MSO, and nonionic surfactant - NIS) sprayed with three nozzle types (XR, AIXR, and TTI). The selected nozzles influenced velvetleaf, common lambsquarters, and sorghum, indicating the possibility of applying herbicides with Coarser sprays, avoiding off-target movement. Our findings suggest adjuvants are an essential factor for improving weed control over the active ingredient, up to 18.7% and 38.3% for MES and RIMTHIF, respectively.

In caecal samples, detection rates were 40%, 93.3% and 33.3%, respectively. 1,2,4-tria-zole was detected in 53% of rectal samples. For an applied use of the method in the field, we collected 43 faecal samples from wild red-legged partridges during autumn cereal seed sowing and found detectable levels of tebuconazole in 18.6% of the analysed wild partridges. The results of the experiment were then used to estimate actual exposure levels from this prevalence value found in wild birds. Our study shows that faecal analysis can be a useful tool to assess farmland bird exposure to triazole fungicides, when samples are fresh and the method has been validated for the detection of target molecules.",NA,644

However, for a more accurate assessment of pesticides effect on foraging pollinators, residues found directly on flowers are a more realistic exposure approximation. We conducted a multi-residue analysis of pesticides on pollen and nectar of melon flowers collected from five fields. The cumulative chronic oral exposure Risk Index (RI) was calculated for Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis to multiple pesticides. However, this index could underestimate the risk since sublethal or synergistic effects are not considered. Therefore, a mixture containing three of the most frequently detected pesticides in our study was tested for synergistic impact on B. terrestris micro-colonies through a chronic oral toxicity test. According to the result, pollen and nectar samples contained numerous pesticide residues, including nine insecticides, nine fungicides, and one herbicide. Eleven of those were not applied by farmers during the crop season, revealing that melon agroecosystems may be pesticide contaminated environments. The primary contributor to the chronic RI was imidacloprid and O. bircornis is at greatest risk for lethality resulting from chronic oral exposure at these sites. In the bumblebee micro-colony bioassay, dietary exposure to acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos and oxamyl at residue level concentration, showed no effects on worker mortality, drone production or drone size and no synergies were detected when pesticide mixtures were evaluated. In conclusion, our findings have significant implications for improving pesticide risk assessment schemes to guarantee pollinator conservation. In particular, bee pesticide risk assessment should not be limited to acute exposure effects to isolated active ingredients in honey bees. Instead, risk assessments should consider the long-term pesticide exposure effects in both pollen and nectar on a range of bees that reflect the diversity of natural ecosystems and the synergistic potential among pesticide formulations.",NA,645

This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value. The commercial formulation composed of deltamethrin+imidacloprid followed the concentration addition model (when compared with parameters retrieved from individual a.i.) and the other three mixtures evaluated (I: chlorothalonil-propineb-deltamethrin+imidacloprid; II: chlorothalonil-propineb-ziram-thiocyclam; III: chlorothalonil-propineb-chlorpyrifos) produced an antagonistic effect on D. magna, thus suggesting less acute toxicity than their individual components. Subsequent chronic studies showed that one of the most toxic mixtures (II) negatively affected D. magna reproduction at sublethal concentrations indicating that this mixture poses a risk to this species if these pesticides co-exist in freshwater systems. These findings provide useful data to better estimate the impact of real agricultural practices related to the use of agrochemicals.",NA,646

Also, diffusion studies require expensive or specialized apparatus the fabrication of which often requires skilled labour and specialized facilities. In this research we have addressed both problems where the effects of four commercially available surfactants on a known tracer molecule were investigated using a 3D printed customized diffusion chamber. Results As a proof-of-concept a customized 3D printed diffusion chamber was devised using two different thermoplastics and was successfully used in a range of diffusion tests. The effect of various solvents and surfactants on S. lycopersicum cuticular membrane indicated an increased rate of flux of tracer molecules across the membranes. This research has validated the application of 3D printing in diffusion sciences and demonstrated the flexibility and potential of this technique. Conclusions Using a 3D printed diffusion apparatus, the effect of commercial surfactants on molecular diffusion through isolated plant membranes was studied.

Many are due to consumption of acutely toxic pesticides; however, there is a lack of national suicide data, limiting knowledge and potential for intervention. In this paper, we aimed to review the literature on pesticide self-poisoning in Pakistan to identify the most problematic pesticides in relation to national pesticide regulations.MethodsInformation on the currently registered and banned pesticides was obtained from Ministry of National Food Security and Research while data on pesticide import and use was extracted from FAOSTAT. We searched the following sources for articles and research papers on poisoning in Pakistan: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE (PUBMED), PS102YCHINFO and Pakmedinet.com using the search terms 'self-poisoning', 'deliberate self-harm', 'suicide', 'methods and means of suicide', 'organophosphate', 'wheat pill', 'aluminium phosphide', 'acute poisoning', OR 'pesticides', AND 'Pakistan'.ResultsAs of May 2021, 382 pesticide active ingredients (substances) were registered in Pakistan, of which five were WHO hazard class Ia (extremely hazardous) and 17 WHO hazard class Ib (highly hazardous). Twenty-six pesticides, four formulations, and seven non-registered pesticides had been banned, of which two were WHO class Ia and five Ib. We identified 106 hospital-level studies of poisoning conducted in Pakistan, of which 23 did not mention self-poisoning cases and one reported no suicidal poisoning cases. We found no community or forensic medicine studies. Of 52,323 poisoning cases identified in these papers, 24,546 [47%] were due to pesticides. The most commonly identified pesticide classes were organophosphorus (OP) insecticides (13,816 cases, 56%) and the fumigant aluminium phosphide (3 g 56% tablets, often termed 'wheat pills'; 686 cases, 2.7%). Few studies identified the particular pesticides involved or the resulting case fatality.ConclusionWe found pesticide poisoning to be a major cause of poisoning in Pakistan, with OP insecticides and the fumigant aluminium phosphide the main pesticides identified. Withdrawal of Class I pesticides (as proposed to occur nationally in 2022) and high concentration aluminium phosphide tablets should rapidly reduce suicidal deaths by reducing the case fatality for low-intention poisoning cases.

This required the introduction of environment-and public health-friendly advanced technologies for plant protection to guard yields from pest destruction in a sustainable way. Encapsulation technology is a promising procedure to increase the effectiveness of pesticide active ingredients while reducing human exposure and environmental impact. Despite the presumed favorable properties of encapsulated pesticide formulations on human health, it is necessary to systematically assess whether they are less harmful to human health than conventional pesticide products.Objectives: We aim to systematically review the literature to answer the question of whether micro-or nano -encapsulated pesticide formulations exert different degrees of toxicity than their conventional (not -encapsu-lated) counterparts in in vivo animal and in vitro (human, animal, and bacterial cell) non-target models. The answer is important to estimate the possible differences in the toxicological hazards of the two different types of pesticide formulations. Because our extracted data will come from different models, we also aim to perform subgroup analyses to investigate how toxicity varies across different models. A pooled toxicity effect estimate will also be performed by meta-analysis when appropriate. Methods: The systematic review will follow the guidelines developed by the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT). The protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement. PubMed (NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), Embase (Elsevier), and Agricola (EBSCOhost) electronic databases will be comprehensively searched in September 2022 to identify eligible studies using multiple search terms of ""pesti-cide"", ""encapsulation"" and ""toxicity"" along with their synonyms and other words that are semantically related. The reference lists of all eligible articles and retrieved reviews will be manually screened to identify additional relevant papers.Eligibility criteria: We will include peer-reviewed experimental (non-target in vivo animal model and in vitro human, animal, and bacterial cell cultures) studies published as full-text articles in English language that simultaneously investigate the effect of any micro-or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulation, applied in all ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure, and its corresponding active ingredient(s) or its conventional non-encapsulated product formulation(s) used in the same ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure on the same pathophysiological outcome. We will exclude studies that examine pesticidal activity on target organisms, cultures of cells isolated from target organisms exposed in vivo or in vitro, and those using biological materials isolated from target organisms/cells. Study appraisal and synthesis: Studies identified by the search will be screened and managed according to the review inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Covidence systematic review tool by two reviewers, who will also blindly extract the data and assess the risk of bias of included studies. The OHAT risk of bias tool will be applied to evaluate the quality and risk of bias in the included studies.

Infestations with this tick can lead to direct damage and cattle mortality due to the transmission of potentially deadly pathogens. Management of this tick species has been focused on the use of synthetical acaricides; however, the emergence of acaricide resistance to single or multiple active ingredients has resulted in a need for novel acaricide compounds. Among potential avenues for the discovery of novel acaricides are plant-derived compounds. The efficacy of five organic compounds (nootkatone, Stop the Bites (R), BioUD (R), lavender oil, and cedarwood oil) was evaluated using larval immersion tests (LITs), repellency assays, and adult immersion tests (AITs).

In this context, the main objective of this study is the development of clay/essential oil formulations against this type of fungus. Double-layer hydroxides (LDHs) and Ghassoul were chosen as clays, and Thyme as an essential oil and its active principle, thymol. The LDHs and Ghassoul materials underwent purification and activation treatments to increase their compatibility with the chosen essential oil. The different materials obtained were characterized by XRD and FTIR. The chemical compositions of the EOs were analyzed by GC-MS chromatography. The main constituents of Thyme oil founded were thymol (67.13%), rho-cymene (4.85%), Z-Caryophyllene (1.77%) and gamma-terpinene (2.74%). The adsorption of thymol on the different materials developed: activated Ghassoul (Gh-A), Hydrotalcite (HT3), and LDH (ZnAl-CO3), showed that the adsorption isotherms can be satisfactorily described by the Langmuir model. Also, the modeling of the adsorption kinetics revealed its conformity to the pseudo-second order model for the different materials. As a result, the adsorption capacity of thymol increases in the following order: ZnAl-CO3, HT3, and Gh-A. The formulations made from the different clays allowed for the preparation of an effective and useful fungicide for wheat storage. The in vitro antifungal activities were tested against the strain Penicillium sp. The results obtained revealed that the formulations based on Gh-A and LDHs retained their antifungal activity even after 5 months of storage. Therefore, in order to evaluate the potential of the formulations on cereals storage (wheat storage case), in vitro antifungal tests with the Gh-A/Thyme formulation were performed on four types of wheat (sterile, non-sterile, dried, and washed then dried wheat).

We adapted WHO guidelines for household insecticides to develop a standardised and higher-throughput methodology for testing aerosolized products in a Peet Grady test chamber (PG-chamber) using caged mosquitoes and an efficient decontamination method. The new approach was validated using insecticide resistant and susceptible Aedes and Anopheles mosquito colonies. An added feature is the inclusion of cage-facing cameras to allow real-time quantification of knockdown following insecticide exposure. The wipe-based decontamination method was highly effective for removing pyrethroids' aerosolized oil-based residues from chamber surfaces, with < 2% mortality recorded for susceptible mosquitoes tested directly on the surfaces. There was no spatial heterogeneity for knockdown or mortality of caged mosquitoes within the PG chamber. The dual-cage approach we implement yields eight-times the throughput compared to a free-flight protocol, allows simultaneous testing of different mosquito strains and effectively discriminates susceptible and resistant mosquito colonies tested side-by-side.",NA,656

As such, it is a property that is routinely measured during the development of new active ingredients and their formulations. To make these measurements, compounds are typically exposed to simulated sunlight after application to a glass substrate. While useful, these measurements neglect key factors that influence photostability under true field conditions. Most importantly, they neglect the fact that compounds are applied to living plant tissue, and that uptake and movement within this tissue provides a mechanism to protect compounds from photodegradation. RESULTSIn this work, we introduce a new photostability assay incorporating leaf tissue as a substrate, designed to run at medium throughput under standardized laboratory conditions. Using three test cases, we demonstrate that our leaf-disc-based assays provides quantitatively different photochemical loss profiles to an assay employing a glass substrate. And we also demonstrate that these different loss profiles are intimately linked to the physical properties of the compounds, the effect that those properties have on foliar uptake and, thereby, the availability of the active ingredient on the leaf surface. CONCLUSIONSThe method presented provides a quick and simple measure of the interplay between abiotic loss processes and foliar uptake, supplying additional information to facilitate the interpretation of biological efficacy data. The comparison of loss between glass slides and leaves also provides a better understanding of when intrinsic photodegradation is likely to be a good model for a compound's behaviour under field conditions.

RESULTSSAC4A presents multiple advantages, including high water solubility, strong binding affinity, universality, and simple preparation. SAC4A showed an average binding constant value of 1.66 x 10(5) M-1 for 25 pesticides. Phase solubility results indicated that SAC4A increased the water solubility of pesticides by 80-1310 times. The herbicidal, fungicidal, and insecticidal activities of supramolecular formulations were found to be superior to those of technical pesticides, and the herbicidal effects were even better than those of commercial formulations.

Formulations containing erythritol, with or without another toxicant, exhibited 90% mortality within 72 h of observation (P = 0.03192). Additionally, erythritol appeared more effective when combined with sucrose in a 1:1 ratio (5% concentration each). This combination showed a 24% and 85% increase in mortality when combined with boric acid and Bti, respectively, at 48 h compared with equivalent groups containing only 10% sucrose. Erythritol appears to kill adult mosquitoes, even in relatively low concentrations, without another toxicant being required. However, erythritol also effectively enhances kill of main ingredient toxicants such as boric acid and Bti, showing a supporting role. The low concentration of erythritol needed to provide significant kill, its ability to fill in as both a sugar base and toxicant, and its ability to be safely handled by humans makes erythritol a strong candidate for use as a supporting ingredient in future bait formulations.",NA,659

Glyphosate and AMPA (one of its main metabolites) are common pollutants of water, soil, and food sources such as crops. They can be detected in biological samples from both exposed workers and general population. Despite glyphosate acts as inhibitor of the shikimate pathway, present only in plants and some microorganisms, its safety in mammals is still debated. Acute glyphosate intoxications are correlated to cardiovascular/neuronal damages, but little is known about the effects of the chronic exposure.Methods: We evaluated the direct biological effects of different concentrations of pure glyphosate/AMPA on a rat-derived cell line of cardiomyoblasts (H9c2) in acute (1-2 h) or sub-chronic (24-48 h) settings. We analyzed cell viability/morphology, ROS production and mitochondrial dynamics.Results: Acute exposure to high doses (above 10 mM) of glyphosate and AMPA triggers immediate cytotoxic effects: reduction in cell viability, increased ROS production, morphological alterations and mitochondrial function. When exposed to lower glyphosate concentrations (1 mu M-1 mM), H9c2 cells showed only a slight variation in cell viability and ROS production, while mitochondrial dynamic was unvaried. Moreover, the phenotype was completely restored after 48 h of treatment. Surprisingly, the sub-chronic (48 h) treatment with low concentrations (1 mu M-1 mM) of AMPA led to a late cytotoxic response, reflected in a reduction in H9c2 viability.Conclusion: The comprehension of the extent of human exposure to these molecules remains pivotal to have a better critical view of the available data.",NA,662

Seven pesticides were detected in selected agricultural products (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and grapes) using the QuEChERS methodology and HPLC-DAD. Standard curves for the investigated pesticides (chlorantraniliprole, methomyl, metalaxyl, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, emamectin benzoate, and cymoxanil) show good linearity, with R-2 values from 0.9785 to 0.9996.

We summarized the data supporting their effects on humans using various computational tools to determine their potential adverse effects. The results of our prediction study show that all of the selected pesticides considered in this study have good oral bioavailability, and those with high toxicity, therefore, could be harmful to human health.

Recently, studies on the effects of extracts obtained from plants on agricultural pests have been increasing day by day and yield successful results. In the study, the effect of an insecticide, which is a commercial formulation of orange oil, on egg laying behavior and acaricidal effect on T. urticae at different doses were investigated. The experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions at 65 +/- 10% humidity and 25 +/- 2 degrees C temperature conditions, on bean leaves, using leaf disc dipping method, using 5 different application doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1 and 2 ml of 100 ml-1 water) and 5 was carried out recursively. Observations were made at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the application by taking the counts of dead and live individuals. As a result of this study, the highest acaricidal effect on T. urticae individuals was determined with a mortality rate of 75.56% at 2% concentration of orange oil 96 hours after the application. In the 96th hour observations, the lowest acaricidal effect was detected at a concentration of 20% to 0.2%. Accordingly, it was observed that the acaricide effect increased as the concentration and duration of the orange oil studied in the study increased.

Besides resistance to post-emergent herbicides becoming increasingly widespread, enhanced metabolism of inhibitors of the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), such as flufenacet, is evolving. Yet, cross-resistance patterns and evolution of this resistance remains poorly understood. RESULTSThe cDNA sequences of five glutathione transferases (GSTs) upregulated in flufenacet resistant black-grass were identified and used for recombinant protein expression. Moderate to slow detoxification of flufenacet was verified for all candidate GSTs expressed in E. coli, and the most active protein produced flufenacet-alcohol instead of a glutathione conjugate, in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH). Moreover, cross-resistance to other VLCFA-inhibitors e.g., acetochlor and pyroxasulfone and the ACCase inhibitor fenoxaprop was verified in vitro. Various other herbicides of different modes of action including VLCFA-inhibitors were not detoxified by the candidate GSTs. CONCLUSIONSAs several in planta upregulated GSTs detoxified flufenacet in vitro, the shift in sensitivity observed in black-grass populations, is likely a result of an additive effect. The polygenic character and the relatively low turnover rate of the individual GSTs may explain the slow evolution of flufenacet resistance. In addition, flufenacet resistance was accompanied by cross-resistance with some, but not all, herbicides of the same mode of action, and furthermore to the ACCase inhibitor fenoxaprop-ethyl. Hence, not only the rotation of herbicide modes of action, but also of individual active ingredients is important for resistance management. (c) 2023 The Authors.

A new commercial, biological herbicide developed in Kenya is able to control striga effectively. The product was approved for use by the Pest Control Products Board in Kenya in September, 2021. It is self-produced in villages using a secondary inoculum provided by a commercial company. The formulated product has some disadvantages, which are a complicated production process, a very short shelf life and high application rate. Additionally, the product has to be applied manually and therefore can only be used in manual production, leaving out the opportunity for farmers using mechanization. For this reason, efforts have been made to formulate the active ingredient Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. strigae strain DSM 33471, as a powder and to use it as a seed coating agent. This article deals with the production of the Fusarium spore powder, its properties, its application to the seed, and its herbicidal effect demonstrated in the first two field trials. The F. oxysporum strain was originally isolated from a wilting striga plant in Kenya. The strain was virulence enhanced to over produce the amino acids leucine, methionine and tyrosine. These amino acids are responsible for a second mode of action apart from the wilting causing effect of the fungus on striga. Whereas leucine and tyrosine have a herbicidal effect, ethylene from methionine triggers the germination of striga seeds in the soil. Additionally, the strain has been improved to be resistant to the fungicide captan, which is commonly used to treat maize seed in Kenya. Seed coating tests conducted on 25 striga-infested small holder farms spread out in six counties of western Kenya reported yield increases of up to 88%. A second trial carried out by the Kenyan Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization showed a 93% reduction of emerged striga plants. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,679

Some of the pesticides used historically were efficacious, nonselective, persistent, and have led to serious impacts on the environment. A well known, and extensively documented example is the large-scale aerial spray programs in New Brunswick, Canada. From 1952 to 1993, 97% of the 6.2 million ha of the forested lands of New Brunswick were treated with at least one application of one insecticide, the majority of which were applied to control outbreaks of eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). The most well known insecticide was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), applied from 1952 to 1968, which still persists in treated soils and adjacent water bodies, and caused the individual and cumulative ecosystem effects that can still be measured today. The insecticides that replaced DDT were nonpersistent and unlikely to be found today. However, during the years of application some of the insecticides were likely to have impacted local ecosystems to some degree. To aid future studies on the efficacy and environmental impact of these insecticides we created a digital spatial data set of known pesticide application in New Brunswick forestry from 1952 to 1993.

Although traditional agrochemicals such as herbicides, insecticides, liming, pesticides, fertilizers etc. are frequently employed in field to improve crop productivity, their excessive use can have noxious effect on the environment and living organisms. These problems can be mitigated by the application of agrochemicals employing bionanocomposites, which increase bio-efficacy and reduces the danger of leaching.

One of the highest-risk pathogens involved in these infections is Botrytis cinerea, which is responsible for the grey mold disease. In this study, a biosurfactant extracted from corn steep liquor (CSL), an agro-industrial residue from the corn-milling industry, was used in combination with copper oxychloride (Cu-Oxy), a copper-based pesticide, to evaluate their fungitoxic activity on B. cinerea cells. The results showed that the mixture of 2 g/L of Cu-Oxy with 16 g/L of the biosurfactant extract from CSL, named biosurfactant pesticide formulation (BS-P), helped in the reduction of colony growth, in the decrease of biomass production, and in the improvement of copper bioaccumulation on fungal mycelium in comparison with aqueous solutions of commercial and pure-copper-based fungicides. A factorial design was conducted to obtain the best operational conditions for enhancing the bioaccumulation of copper by B. cinerea cells in the presence of BS-P, resulting in a maximum copper uptake of 2122 & mu;g Cu/g dry weight when using 1 g/L of Cu-Oxy combined with 8 g/L of CSL biosurfactant extract at an incubation temperature of 15 & DEG;C. It was also proved that, due to the absence of the biosurfactant extract, the amount of copper bio-adsorbed by fungal mycelium was considerably decreased and, therefore, so was its fungitoxic activity.

The active ingredients of these formulations can enter the human body through air, food, or water. Epidemiological studies suggest that these compounds strongly affect the developing brain in fetal and infant stages due to their ability to breach the underdeveloped blood-brain barrier. Since neural progenitor stem cells (NPCs) in the developing brain are the most vulnerable to these compounds, the mechanisms by which NPCs experience toxicity upon exposure to these chemicals must be investigated. Here, we assessed the viability of human fetal NPCs in 2D cultures in the presence of the active ingredients of six widely used pesticides using Live/Dead (R) and Hoechst staining. The IC50 values ranged from 4.1-201 mu M. A significant drop in cell viability with increasing toxicant concentration (p < 0.01) was noted, with the order of toxicity being malathion < 4-aminopyridine < methoprene < prallethrin < temephos < pyriproxyfen. Changes in cellular biomechanical characteristics (Young's modulus, tether force, membrane tension, and tether radius) were quantified using atomic force microscopy, whereas cell migration was elucidated over 48 h using a customized wound-healing assay. The Young's modulus of fetal NPCs exposed to IC50/2 doses of these compounds was reduced by 38-70% and that of those exposed to IC50 doses was reduced by 71-80% (p < 0.001 vs. controls for both; p < 0.01 for IC50 vs. IC50/2 for each compound).

Self-assembly nanotechnology is a promising strategy by which to develop novel nano-formulations for pesticides. Nano-formulations improve the effective utilization of pesticides and reduce risks to the environment because of their eco-friendly preparation, high drug loading, and desirable physicochemical properties. Here, to enhance the utilization efficiency of myclobutanil (MYC) and develop a novel nano-formulation, carrier-free co-assembled nanoparticles (MT NPs) based on MYC and tannic acid (TA) were prepared by noncovalent molecular interactions using a green preparation process without any additives. ResultsThe results showed that the prepared spherical nanoparticles had good stability in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions, low surface tension (40.53 mN m(-1)), high rainfastness, and good maximum retention values on plant leaves. Release of active ingredients from MT NPs could be regulated by altering the molar ratio of subassemblies in the co-assembly and the pH of the environment. Antifungal experiments demonstrated that MT NPs had better activities against Alternaria alternata and Fusarium graminearum [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 6.40 and 77.08 mg/L] compared with free MYC (EC50 = 11.46 and 124.82 mg/L), TA (EC50 = 251.19 and 503.81 mg/L), and an MYC + TA mixture (EC50 = 9.62 and 136.21 mg/L). These results suggested that MYC and TA incorporated in the co-assembled nanoparticles had a synergistic antifungal activity. The results of a genotoxicity assessment indicated that MT NPs could reduce the genotoxicity of MYC to plant cells.

The resultant nano -formulations were friendly to the environment and can be an alternative to increase the yiel of agricultural fields. To achieve this, the surface of the halloysite (Hal) was modified by the adsorption of five surfactants (one cationic and four nonionic) to obtain an organophilic organohalloysites (OHal). Adsorption isotherms and FTIR characterization demonstrated that OHal was obtained due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the nonionic surfactants and the Si-OH and Al-OH groups of the Hal, as well as due to cation exchange with the cationic surfactant. The Tbz was encapsulated in the OHal by adsorption. The mass of Tbz adsorbed was 6.73, 2.92, 4.41, 2.19, and 1.86 mg/g for the OHal with Span 20, Span 80, Tween 80, Tween 85, and HDTMA, respectively. This demonstrated that the surfactants with the highest uptake capacity in OHal have the lowest HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance). The release kinetics of Tbz in the OHal occurred rapidly (approximately in 2 days), regardless of the surfactant type. Once encapsulated the Tbz with the alginate, the release time occurred between 5 and 15 days, decreasing the released quantity between 50 and 75%, evidencing a slow release and greater kinetics control. The confrontation of nanoformulations vs. Fusarium spp. delayed the fungus growth, like commercial tebuconazole does, corroborating the antifungal effect of the material, even though the nano -pesticide synthesized in this work has 20 times less Tbz.",NA,686

The resistance of B. thuringiensis biopesticide spores in comparison to the genetically closely related foodborne B. cereus against heat and UV-C treatment is investigated in this study. The results show that B. thuringiensis biopesticide spores with the commercial granulated product formulation are better protected and as such more resistant to both wet heat (D values at 90 degrees C: 50.1-79.5 min) and UV-C treatment (D values at 0.6 mW/cm2: 7.5-8.9 min) than the pure spore suspension. The enhanced UV-C resistance properties of B. thuringiensis-formulated spores also indicate that the B. thuringiensis spores in powder or granule formulation applied in the field might not be effectively inactivated by solar radiation (UV-A and UV-B) in a short period. Furthermore, the spores of one emetic B. cereus toxin-producing strain (LFMFP 254; a Belgian outbreak strain) were found more resistant to the wet heat at 90 degrees C (D90-value = 71.2 min) than other tested pure spore suspensions, although the spores of B. cereus 254 did not show different behavior against UV-C treatment.

Due to their systemic nature and high solubility, neonicotinoids are frequently recorded in soil, water, untreated plant matter and non-target organisms. Studies have demonstrated their capacity to induce invertebrate mortality, however, very little research has been conducted beyond pollinator exposure, particularly under field conditions. Typically, many neonicotinoids are applied via seed-dressings, reducing their direct contact with pollinators, but offering an unintended soilexposure pathway. Soil biology underpins many vital functions, from regulating water and gas flow, to maintaining physical soil structure. In this study we investigated the effect of a commercial neonicotinoid pesticide (Insyst & REG;) on the abundance, richness, and composition of both the mesofaunal and microbial communities and associated metabolome during oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) production. Our results showed that over a single growing season, foliar application of Insyst & REG; (250 g ha-1, 50 g ha-1 of the active ingredient, acetamiprid) had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the measured soil biological indexes.

In addition, we showed that the active ingredient (acetamiprid) was rapidly degraded by the soil microbial community (theoretical half-life = 119 days) during the summer cropping season.

Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are considered safe for non-target organisms and environmentally benign at currently allowed environmental exposure levels. However, their increased use in recent years has triggered questions about possible adverse outcomes due to low dose chronic exposure in animals and humans. While the toxicity of GBHs has primarily been attributed to glyphosate, other largely unstudied components of GBHs may be inherently toxic or could act synergistically with glyphosate. Thus, comparative studies of glyphosate and GBHs are needed to parse out their respective toxicity. Methods: We performed such a comparative screen using pure glyphosate and two popular GBHs at the same glyphosate acid equivalent concentrations in the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica. This planarian has been shown to be a useful model for both ecotoxicology and neurotoxicity/developmental neurotoxicity studies. Effects on morphology and various behavioral readouts were obtained using an automated screening platform, with assessments on day 7 and day 12 of exposure. Adult and regenerating planarians were screened to allow for detection of developmentally selective effects. Results: Both GBHs were more toxic than pure glyphosate. While pure glyphosate induced lethality at 1mM and no other effects, both GBHs induced lethality at 316 mu M and sublethal behavioral effects starting at 31.6 mu M in adult planarians. These data suggest that glyphosate alone is not responsible for the observed toxicity of the GBHs. Because these two GBHs also include other active ingredients, namely diquat dibromide and pelargonic acid, respectively, we tested whether these compounds were responsible for the observed effects. Screening of the equivalent concentrations of pure diquat dibromide and pure pelargonic acid revealed that the toxicity of either GBH could not be explained by the active ingredients alone. Discussion: Because all compounds induced toxicity at concentrations above allowed exposure levels, our data indicates that glyphosate/GBH exposure is not an ecotoxicological concern for D. japonica planarians. Developmentally selective effects were not observed for all compounds. Together, these data demonstrate the usefulness of high throughput screening in D. japonica planarians for assessing various types of toxicity, especially for comparative studies of several chemicals across different developmental stages.",NA,691

These ingredients, mainly composed of polymeric surfactants, are considered inert vis-a-vis the targeted organisms and nature. Nonetheless, a relatively low attention is given to their analysis and fate tracking in the environment. In this context, the current paper, embedded in a large study of fate and impact of formulated pesticides in soil, focuses on the analysis of these formulation ingredients. It mainly highlights and discusses the characteristic response of these ingredients in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted screening of two commercial herbicides applied on soil. This characteristic response is based on different spectral and chromatographic aspects, as their amplified adducts and double-charged ions formation, or their ""wavy"" chromatographic profiles and the inversion of their elution order following the polymerization degree. These patterns are briefly discussed in order to explain them, and then thanks to their understanding, 12 different series (165 compounds) of formulation ingredients were outlined and discriminated from active substance and soil metabolites. After, high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry data were investigated for rapid interseries and intraseries identification-by-chain. In addition, recommendations for methods development and hints on postanalytical data processing for identity determination of these ingredients are given in order to help in enhancing future studies.

The irrational use of synthetic products has affected human health and the environment, and has generated resistance, which is why the use of natural products could be a safer alternative. In this study, the formulation of a nanoemulsion was carried out to provide greater stability to the botanical compound 1,8-cineole, whose pesticidal effect is documented; however, it is not used due to its high volatility. The pesticidal effect of this nanoemulsion was also evaluated against the pests known as two-spotted spider mite, corn aphid and silverleaf whitefly. Nanotransport systems such as nanoemulsions allows for the field application of molecules that are chemically unstable on their own, such as monoterpenoids. With this study it was possible to determine that these nanoemulsion systems favor the release of the active compound in laboratory tests, increasing the mortality rate of the three pests. This allows for proposing this nanoemulsion as a potential botanical pesticide product against agricultural arthropod pests. Pest control is a main concern in agriculture. Indiscriminate application of synthetic pesticides has caused negative impacts leading to the rapid development of resistance in arthropod pests. Plant secondary metabolites have been proposed as a safer alternative to conventional pesticides. Monoterpenoids have reported bioactivities against important pests; however, due to their high volatility, low water solubility and chemical instability, the application of these compounds has been limited. Nanosystems represent a potential vehicle for the broad application of monoterpenoids. In this study, an 1,8-cineole nanoemulsion was prepared by the low energy method of phase inversion, characterization of droplet size distribution and polydispersity index (PDI) was carried out by dynamic light scattering and stability was evaluated by centrifugation and Turbiscan analysis. Fumigant bioactivity was evaluated against Tetranychus urticae, Rhopalosiphum maidis and Bemisia tabaci. A nanoemulsion with oil:surfactant:water ratio of 0.5:1:8.5 had a droplet size of 14.7 nm and PDI of 0.178. Formulation was stable after centrifugation and the Turbiscan analysis showed no particle migration and a delta backscattering of +/- 1%. Nanoemulsion exhibited around 50% more bioactivity as a fumigant on arthropods when compared to free monoterpenoid. These results suggest that nanoformulations can provide volatile compounds of protection against volatilization, improving their bioactivity.",NA,696

Taking into account that there is a narrow available spectrum of contact insecticides for the management of stored-grain insects, a laboratory study was conducted to evaluate an insecticidal formulation containing two active ingredients, i.e., thiamethoxam plus chlorantraniliprole, when applied on grains and different surfaces against adults of the aforementioned species. Complete mortality was observed for S. oryzae on all three commodities, for R. dominica on wheat and rice, and for T. castaneum on wheat, 14 days post-initial exposure at the highest dose. At the end of the 90-day storage period, S. oryzae showed the maximum mortality, whereas T. granarium showed the lowest. Bioassays on surfaces revealed that thiamethoxam plus chlorantraniliprole applied on metal killed more adult individuals of all species than on cement, ceramic, or wood. Sitophilus oryzae was found to be the most sensitive on metal, followed by R. dominica, T. castaneum, and T. granarium. An insecticide containing the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam + the diamide chlorantraniliprole was evaluated against adults of Rhyzopertha dominica, Tribolium castaneum, Trogoderma granarium, and Sitophilus oryzae under laboratory bioassays both on freshly treated grain as well as on treated grain stored over 90 days for its persistence in efficacy. In laboratory bioassays, the insecticide was applied on wheat, maize, or rice at four doses, while in persistence bioassays on wheat at the same doses. Mortality and progeny were assessed in both laboratory and persistence bioassays. After 14 days of exposure, S. oryzae exhibited 100% mortality on all three commodities at the highest dose, while R. dominica showed complete mortality on wheat or rice and T. castaneum on wheat. For a period of 90 days, S. oryzae exhibited 42.69% mortality, followed by R. dominica (35.26%), T. castaneum (27.08%), and T. granarium (18.63%) at the highest dose. Progeny was successfully suppressed in all cases of complete mortality in laboratory bioassays and for S. oryzae for 90 days in persistence bioassays. Laboratory trials were also performed on plywood, concrete, ceramic tile, and steel at one dose.

This article discusses methods that eliminate the need for costly and energy-consuming processing equipment. These methods can be utilized in any laboratory by users without access to specialized devices. A novel L-FDM technique that builds upon the fundamentals of the FDM additive manufacturing process has been developed. It includes a mechanism that directly incorporates a chemical substance and alters polymer fibers throughout the fine process. This method eliminates the need for additional extrusion operations and compounding equipment to introduce chemical additives and solvents. This advancement opens up new opportunities for printers to be used in chemical labs to test new or known chemical substances.

The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii is a polyphagous pest that can cause large crop yield losses. Here, we tested the effects of three fungicides, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and chlorothalonil, on the fitness and Buchnera endosymbiont of A. gossypii. ResultsThe formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, and the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin produced dose-dependent mortality in A. gossypii, whereas there was no dose-dependent mortality for chlorothalonil. The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin significantly reduced the lifespan and fecundity of A. gossypii, and increased the density of Buchnera in the parental generation but not the (unexposed) F-1. When the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin was tested, the lifespan of the F-0 generation was also reduced, but the density of Buchnera was not, indicating that non-insecticidal chemicals in the fungicide formulation may affect the density of the endosymbiont of A. gossypii. There was no transgenerational effect of the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin on the lifespan and Buchnera of (unexposed) F-1.

Nonetheless, low statistical power, a mixture of histological subtypes and a lack of information on tumour EBV status complicate the interpretability of the results. Most HL cases occurred at older ages, thus we could not explore associations with adolescent or young adult HL.

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called ""inert"" co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable.",NA,705

Nanopesticides are pesticides that have been made with these nanoparticles and have a high application efficiency and significantly fewer hazardous environmental impacts than pesticides that have been made chemically.

Therefore, we evaluated, in laboratory conditions, the insecticide potential of recommended rates of commercial formulations: organophosphate malathion (10 mg active ingredient - AI/kg), spinosyns bioinsecticide spinosad (1 mg AI/kg) and pyrethroid deltamethrins (0,25 mg AI/kg, with and without the synergist piperonil butoxide - PBO) after 210-, 265-, 310- and 365-days of post-treatment. Testing was performed on two types of beans with kidney- and cranberry-shaped kernels to evaluate the insecticide residual effects on the survival of weevils, progeny production, and related levels of kernels damage. Survival of weevils depends mainly on adults exposure/living period in treated beans and on the recovering period. Small differencies in weevils survival in each insecticide were recorded. We found increases in progeny and thus higher damage in beans, as manifested effects of sublethal doses only in malathion treated bean. In spinosad treated bean we recorded low levels of progeny and damage, below the economic threshold. In deltamethrin treatments, we recorded weevils avoiding contact with beans, no progeny and no damages. The effect of bean type was very low or non existent. It can be concluded that bioinsecticide spinosad can provide long-term protection of common beans against A. obtectus, while organophosphate malathion has low control potential. Pyrethroid deltamethrins residues cause adults to avoid treated beans and no offspring to appear. The obtained results might have significant impact on better understanding of weevils behaviour in the presence of insecticide residues and on the creation of sustainable pest management programmes.",NA,710

However, a few effective and sustainable control methods are currently available. To discover novel and effective management approaches, we screened marine fungi for their antibacterial activity against phytopathogenic bacteria in vitro and in vivo. MethodsWe screened the culture broth of 55 fungal strains isolated from various marine sources (seawater, algae, and sediment) for their in vitro antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. Then, only the fungal strain (designated UL-Ce9) with higher antibacterial activity in vitro was tested in an in vivo experiment against tomato bacterial wilt. The active compounds of UL-Ce9 were extracted using ethyl acetate, purified by a series of chromatography, and the structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Pesticide formulations of toluquinol were prepared as soluble concentrates and wettable powder. The disease control efficacy of toluquinol formulations was evaluated against blight of rice and the bacterial wilt of tomato. Results and discussionThe culture broth of UL-Ce9 showed high antibacterial activity against Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni in vitro, and we selected UL-Ce9 for the in vivo test. The UL-Ce9 culture broth completely suppressed the bacterial wilt of tomato at a dilution of 1:5. The phylogenetic analysis identified UL-Ce9 as Penicillium griseofulvum, and the antibacterial metabolites were revealed as patulin, gentisyl alcohol, and toluquinol, all of which were associated with the biosynthetic pathway of the mycotoxin patulin. Patulin exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against 16 phytopathogenic bacteria in vitro, followed by toluquinol and gentisyl alcohol. As patulin is toxic, we selected toluquinol to investigate its potential use as a pesticide against bacterial plant diseases. Compared with the chemicals currently being applied in agriculture (streptomycin and oxytetracycline), toluquinol formulations exhibited similar and higher control efficacies against bacterial leaf blight of rice and bacterial wilt of tomato, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antibacterial activity of toluquinol against phytopathogenic bacteria. Our results suggest that toluquinol is a potential candidate for the development of novel and effective pesticides for the management of bacterial plant diseases.",NA,713

In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient-AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup (R) Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from similar to 20% to similar to 50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released similar to 70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use.",NA,714

Specifically, three inert dusts-namely, a kaolin, a zeolite and a diatomaceous earth formulation-and three residual insecticides-i.e., the pyrethroid deltamethrin, the bacterial insecticide spinosad and the juvenile hormone analogue S-Methoprene-were evaluated against adults of P. truncatus. Adult mortality was assessed after 7, 14, 21 and 28 d of exposure, whereas progeny production was measured after an additional interval of 28 d for inert dusts and 65 d for the contact insecticides. Moreover, the number and weight of infested and uninfested kernels per vial was measured. Low mortality levels were recorded for the three inert dusts even for the highest application rate and after 28 d of exposure. Moreover, the inert dusts tested failed to suppress the progeny production of P. truncatus. In contrast, high mortality levels were recorded for deltamethrin and spinosad that exceeded 95% already after 7 d of exposure at the lowest application rate (0.5 ppm).

The significance of biological plant protection has been on the rise, driven by the European Union's mandate to decrease the reliance on chemical pesticides, the discontinuation of certain chemical active substances, and their limited availability. Microbiological plant protection products find application in organic farming systems. Among these, mycoinsecticides are prominent examples, utilizing insecticidal fungi such as Beauveria bassiana, Cordyceps fumosoroseus, C. farinosa, and Metarhizium anisopliae complex. Due to the high sensitivity of these organisms to unfavorable weather and environmental conditions, their use in the protection of field crops may not bring the desired effect. The enhancement of their efficacy may be accomplished through the use of adjuvants. Adjuvants are substances incorporated into plant protection products, including microbial insecticides, or used alone to enhance their effectiveness. They can play a pivotal role in improving the performance of mycoinsecticides by ensuring better coverage on plant surfaces and increasing the likelihood of successful pest control, thereby contributing to the overall success of biological methods of pest control. Consequently, it becomes imperative to investigate the impact of various adjuvants on the survival and effectiveness of microorganisms. Furthermore, there is no officially approved list of adjuvants for use in organic farming, the use of inadequate adjuvant may result in failure to obtain an organic certificate.

Currently, there is little evidence they do, but that could just reflect lack of clinical investigation. Consequently, it is necessary to carry out a safety evaluation process, quantifying risks so that they can be properly managed. A workshop on this topic in 2022 discussed how best to undertake quantitative risk assessment (QRA) for pesticide products, including learning from the experience of industries, notably cosmetics, that already undertake such a process routinely. It also addressed ways to remedy the matter of clinical investigation, even if only to demonstrate the absence of a problem. Workshop participants concluded that QRA for skin sensitisers in pesticide formulations was possible, but required careful justification of any safety factors applied, as well as improvements to the estimation of skin exposure. The need for regulations to stay abreast of the science was also noted. Ultimately, the success of any risk assessment/ management for skin sensitisers must be judged by the clinical picture. Accordingly, the workshop participants encouraged the development of more active skin health monitoring amongst groups most exposed to the products.",NA,727

It seems very important to address and effectively deal with the main weed management challenges (low crop yield and environmental pollution) by investigating the potential of newly introduced materials, such as biocompatible polymer-based nanoparticles. The current review aims to encourage agricultural or environmental researchers to conduct new research on the synthesis and application of modified herbicides, such as nanoherbicides, for application in weed management and to provide a comprehensive foundation on the topic. Such nanosystems could help with the promotion of the controlled release of active ingredients and extend their action time, resulting in a reduction in dose and application number; improve the physical and chemical characteristics of the herbicide to increase foliar adhesion; prevent degradation that results from environmental factors (such as sunlight, temperature, microorganisms, or pH); and decrease herbicide leaching and contamination of the environment. Furthermore, it has been indicated that some polymeric nanocarriers can penetrate biological barriers, including membranes and plant cell walls, and translocate across vascular tissues, resulting in a more efficient delivery of active ingredients. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) is a biocompatible material that is easily decomposable by enzymes and fungi. PCL nanoparticles could be applied as nanocarriers of herbicides in agriculture due to their low toxicity, their potential for large-scale synthesis from inexpensive materials, their ability to dissolve herbicides, their high loading capacity, and their ability to help minimize the chemical decomposition of herbicides.",NA,728

Triatoma infestans (Klug) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is the main vector of Chagas disease in the southern cone of South America. Genetic evidence indicates that T. infestans originated in the Cochabamba region, Sucre, in Central Bolivia, where there are jungle sites of this species, and from which the domestic species is believed to derive, currently distributed in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Chemical control of the vector by spraying dwellings with pyrethroids has been the most widely used strategy to reduce the incidence of this endemic disease. The long-term use of pyrethroid insecticides in T. infestans control campaigns has led to the development of resistance in treated populations. Recently, there has been great interest in the use of botanical products as new alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Essential oils (EOs) seem to be good candidates due to lesser mammalian toxicity and persistence in the environment. In this review, we summarize recent data on toxicity of EOs and their compounds against T. infestans.Recent Findings A total of 12 research articles from different sources were reviewed and analyzed to compare the effectiveness of the studied EOs and monoterpenes on kissing bugs. The monoterpenes and the EOs reported in the experimental procedures and their effectiveness against T. infestans are described in Table 1. A total of 22 monoterpenes and 46 EOs were reported and distributed in 12 botanical families. Of these, 18 EOs belonged to the following families: Asteraceae, 8; Lamiaceae, 5; Apiaceae, 2; Anacardiaceae, 2; Buddlejaceae, 4; Verbenaceae, 2; and one each to Monimiaceae, Capparaceae, Umbelliferae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae, and Labiatae. The main active components of the EOs responsible for the ovicidal and larvicidal properties on T. infestans were menthyl acetate, L-menthone, L-menthol, isomenthol, piperitone, linalool, pulegone, 1,8-cineole, alpha,beta-thujone, limonene, E-anethol, and E-nerolidol. Moreover, the compounds eugenol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, menthol, alpha-terpineol, and thymol were the most effective inducing hyperactivity (disordered, erratic, and spasmodic locomotor activity). Reported effectiveness varied widely due to the difference in the evaluation methodology and properties of both EOs and monoterpenes. Some of the advantages of using EOs and monoterpenes are that they have little environmental impact because of their low toxicity to mammals and very low environmental persistence. An important finding was the reported synergism on the hyperactivity and mortality effect between eugenol and permethrin on T. infestans.Summary In recent years, the toxicity of new essential oils and their compounds on T. infestans was evaluated, as well as combinations of monoterpenes with pyrethroids. The latter is the most promising result since it could be a new tool for monitoring the population dynamic. The findings of this work show that certain EOs and their components have insecticidal and repellent potential for their development as formulations for T. infestans. The production of EO is feasible due to its low cost, availability, and accessibility. It is difficult to compare the reported info from literature due to the wide variety of exposure bioassay techniques and chemical extraction methods of the EOs and their compounds. The synergistic effect between eugenol and permethrin on T. infestans suggests that this combination could be a viable alternative of the flushing-out strategy employed in the national control campaigns. Thus, essential oils and their constituents would contribute to delay the development of insecticide resistance in the populations of T. infestans through the combination of these actives with pyrethroids.",NA,730

While the application of pesticides can improve the quality and yield of crops, plant resistance and the harm caused by pesticide residues to the environment and humans have led to the search for greener and safer pesticide formulations to improve the current situation. In recent years, nanopesticides (NPts) have shown great potential in agriculture due to their high efficiency, low toxicity, targeting, resistance, and controlled slow release demonstrated in the experimental stage. Commonly used approaches to prepare NPts include the use of nanoscale metal materials as active ingredients (AI) (ingredients that can play a role in insecticide, sterilization and weeding) or the construction of carriers based on commonly used pesticides to make them stable in nano-sized form. This paper systematically summarizes the advantages and effects of NPts over conventional pesticides, analyzes the formation and functions of NPts in terms of structure, AI, and additives, and describes the mechanism of action of NPts.

This position changed in 2014, when the US Environmental Protection Agency granted an unrestricted Section 3 registration for tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) strain U2 as a herbicide active ingredient for a commercial bioherbicide (SolviNix LC). It is approved for the control of tropical soda apple (TSA, Solanum viarum), an invasive 'noxious weed' in the United States. TSA is a problematic weed in cattle pastures and natural areas in Florida. The TMGMV-U2 product kills TSA consistently, completely, and within a few weeks after its application.

One major challenge with pyrethroids is their perceived repellency. This perception can influence decisions made by pest control operators, especially when insecticides are used to reduce insect entry into or movement within structures. One major indoor pest that has been repeatedly shown to be repelled by some pyrethroids is the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. However, most experiments evaluating pyrethroid repellency in the German cockroach have used end-point assays, which do not provide information on the movement that led to the final position. Therefore, we evaluated the kinetic behavioral response of field-collected German cockroaches to five pyrethroid-based products and their active ingredients (A.I.) in open behavioral arenas using advanced video tracking software. In addition, in an effort to compare our free-moving experiments with end-point assays, we evaluated sheltering behavior using two-choice harborage arrestment assays where German cockroaches were provided a choice between pyrethroid-treated and untreated shelters.RESULTSAll pyrethroid-formulated products and their respective A.I.'s failed to affect field-collected German cockroach movement behavior in free-moving assays, while positive controls (DEET, corn mint oil) resulted in reduced time spent by German cockroaches in treated areas. However, despite their willingness to move over pyrethroids-treated surfaces, field-collected German cockroaches displayed a reduced propensity to arrest on pyrethroids treated tents.CONCLUSIONWhile most pyrethroids/pyrethroid-formulated products affected German cockroach arrestment, pyrethroids and pyrethroid-formulated products failed to change German cockroach movement behavior in free-moving assays. These results indicate the pyrethroids tested act as contact irritants rather than true-spatial repellents on field-collected German cockroaches. This distinction is critical to refining pest management strategies involving pyrethroids. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. Surfaces treated with pyrethroids did not alter field-collected German cockroach movement behavior in free moving assays, but they reduced arrestment when compared to untreated surfaces. Therefore, non-volatile pyrethroids should be characterized as contact irritants rather than true repellents in field-collected German cockroaches (Photo Credit: Matt Bertone, North Carolina State University, USA).image",NA,733

In the standard, certain pollutants discharge limits are limited strictly or loosely, resulting in practical management implementation difficulties. In view of the highly selective targeting characteristics of organic pesticide active ingredients in fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, a method for deriving discharge limits based on the water quality criteria for pesticides for the protection of nonsensitive species is established based on the idea of fully protecting aquatic organisms beyond sensitive objects. Through the use of malathion as an example, by screening its toxicity data in different species of aquatic organisms, the sequence point with the most significant change in the acute toxicity sensitivity of the species is taken as the variation point in the cumulative frequency of the sensitive and nonsensitive species to derive the water quality criteria, using the species sensitivity distribution method as the scientific basis for determining the discharge limits. After a comparative analysis of different simulation models, the sigmoid model, with the best fit, is selected to determine that the sensitive species hazard concentration (HCs) of malathion to aquatic organisms in China is 46.4 mu g/L, and the discharge limit derived from the HCs based on the relationship between the environmental capacity and emissions is rounded to 250 mu g/L. Studies showed that the relationship between the emissions limit derived from the water quality criteria for protecting nonsensitive species and malathion limit stipulated in the ""Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water"" conforms to the corresponding relationship of the quality standard and discharge standard, which can be achieved by current pollution control technology, combined with water quality improvement.

In this study, glutathione (GSH)/pH dual stimuli-responsive and chlorantraniliprole (CHL)/spinosad (SPI) double-loaded nanoformulations (DMSNs-CHL-polyethyleneimine (PEI)-SPI) are designed to manage Spodoptera frugiperda. The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs)-based DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI exhibit a high insecticide loading content (52.03%), strong corn leave adhesion (87.63%), and enhanced insecticide release behaviors (94.53% for CHL and 57.05% for SPI at 144 h) in response to GSH and alkaline conditions. DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI can effectively enhance the utilization efficiency of insecticides for the dual stimuli-responsive. Bioactivity tests showed that the corn leaves sprayed with DMSNs-CHLPEI-SPI possess higher toxicity to Spodoptera frugiperda than physical mixture and single-loaded nano-formulations with the same amount of active ingredients. DMSNs-CHL-PEI-SPI also possesses a long-term control efficacy, with similar to 20% pest mortality on corn leaves at 21 d after spraying. In fields, two or more insecticides are usually used to control one insect pest, instead of a single active ingredient. That means the double-loaded insecticide nanoformulation is a practical tool for developing novel insecticide formulations.

NCs ranging in diameter from 55 to 200 nm, with surface zeta potentials from -40 to +40 mV, and with seven different shell material properties were prepared and studied. Shell materials included synthetic polymers poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene glycol), and poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), naturally occurring compounds fish gelatin and soybean lecithin, and semisynthetic hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS). NC cores contained a gadolinium tracer for tracking by mass spectrometry, a fluorescent dye for tracking by confocal microscopy, and model hydrophobic compounds (alpha tocopherol acetate and polystyrene) that could be replaced by agrochemical payloads in subsequent applications. After foliar application onto tomato plants with Silwet L-77 surfactant, internalization efficiencies of up to 85% and NC translocation efficiencies of up to 32% were observed.

Their molecular diversity enables a vast array of essential functions, such as energy storage, immunological signalling, and the modification of food texture and consistency. Due to their rheological characteristics, solubility, sweetness, hygroscopicity, ability to prevent crystallization, flavour encapsulation, and coating capabilities, carbohydrates are useful in food products. Carbohydrates hold potential for the future of therapeutic development due to their important role in sustained drug release, drug targeting, immune antigens, and adjuvants. Bio-based packaging provides an emerging phase of materials that offer biodegradability and biocompatibility, serving as a substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers used as coatings on paper. Blending polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) with carbohydrate biopolymers, such as starch, cellulose, polylactic acid, etc., reduces the undesirable qualities of PHA, such as crystallinity and brittleness, and enhances the PHA's properties in addition to minimizing manufacturing costs. Carbohydrate-based biopolymeric nanoparticles are a viable and cost-effective way to boost agricultural yields, which is crucial for the increasing global population. The use of biopolymeric nanoparticles derived from carbohydrates is a potential and economically viable approach to enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural harvests, which is of utmost importance given the developing global population. The carbohydrate biopolymers may play in plant protection against pathogenic fungi by inhibiting spore germination and mycelial growth, may act as effective elicitors inducing the plant immune system to cope with pathogens. Furthermore, they can be utilised as carriers in controlled-release formulations of agrochemicals or other active ingredients, offering an alternative approach to conventional fungicides.

Herein, we identify WSPs and WDPs used in agricultural formulations on the German and Swiss markets. By searching the scientific literature, patents, and manufacturer websites, we tentatively identified that 233 of the 1815 listed trade names of formulation additives contained polymers, the majority of which belonged to three main chemical classes: polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based (co)polymers, functionalized polysaccharides (PSacs), and vinylic (co)polymers (VCPs). We report information on their functionalization, molecular weights, and market significance. In 2015, their estimated combined annual application volume in Switzerland surpassed 100 tonnes. Low molecular weight PEGs and natural, unfunctionalized PSacs reportedly biodegrade, suggesting no accumulation in soils associated with their use as formulation additives. Conversely, high molecular weight functionalized PEGs, functionalized PSacs, and the majority of the VCPs have been reported to undergo only slow or no soil biodegradation. These polymers may thus persist and accumulate in agricultural soils, requiring more detailed investigations of their environmental fate and resulting exposure scenarios.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay.Methodology/Principal findingsUsing standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifically enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides.Conclusions/SignificanceOur findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. Monitoring the susceptibility of insect populations to chemical insecticides provides vital information for resistance management. New chemicals are being tested and added to the arsenal used for malaria prevention. As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard operating procedure for testing insecticide susceptibility in adult mosquitoes has been updated to include new active ingredients. To evaluate their susceptibility to clothianidin, a neonicotinoid or to flupyradifurone, a butenolide, adult mosquitoes are not exposed to the active ingredient alone, but to a mixture containing a surfactant which helps to solubilize the pesticide. In the present study, we report that surfactants such as vegetable oil esters or soap can enhance the potency of some active ingredients. Because of this synergistic action, the actual level of susceptibility of the insect populations tested can be largely overestimated. However, the results also reveal that some affordable products such as soaps can enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoids against mosquitoes. Although it remains unclear how soaps can be used as an adjuvant in insecticide formulations applied against mosquitoes, their potential utility warrants further investigations.",NA,739

The primary aim of adjuvant products is to increase the spreading and sticking of spray droplets and to increase the penetration of active ingredients through the cuticles of leaves or targeted pests, which can reduce the amount of active ingredient needed for effective pest control. Adjuvants are made up of compounds drawn from the ""inert ingredient"" list maintained by EPA but are identified as ""principal functioning agents"" when used in adjuvant products. These inert compounds do not undergo the same testing and risk assessment process that is required of pesticide active ingredients and generally have no mitigation measures that prevent application onto crops during bloom at times of day when bees are foraging.

This widespread dissemination raises the question of non-target effects on a wide range of organisms, including soil micro-organisms. Despite a large body of scientific studies reporting the harmful effects of GBHs, the health and environmental safety of glyphosate and its commercial formulations remains controversial. In particular, contradictory results have been obtained on the possible genotoxicity of these herbicides depending on the organisms or biological systems tested, the modes and durations of exposure and the sensitivity of the detection technique used. We previously showed that the well-characterized soil filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans was highly affected by a commercial GBH formulation containing 450 g/L of glyphosate (R450), even when used at doses far below the agricultural application rate. In the present study, we analysed the possible mutagenicity of R450 in A. nidulans by screening for specific mutants after different modes of exposure to the herbicide. R450 was found to exert a mutagenic effect only after repeated exposure during growth on agar-medium, and depending on the metabolic status of the tested strain. The nature of some mutants and their ability to tolerate the herbicide better than did the wild-type strain suggested that their emergence may reflect an adaptive response of the fungus to offset the herbicide effects. The use of a non-selective molecular approach, the quantitative random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD-qPCR), showed that R450 could also exert a mutagenic effect after a one-shot overnight exposure during growth in liquid culture. However, this effect was subtle and no longer detectable when the fungus had previously been repeatedly exposed to the herbicide on a solid medium. This indicated an elevation of the sensitivity threshold of A. nidulans to the R450 mutagenicity, and thus confirmed the adaptive capacity of the fungus to the herbicide.",NA,743

The purpose of this study is to develop an insecticidal packaging film based on pectin and essential oil (EO) extracted from Citrus aurantium (L., 1753) fruit peels.The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and cumulative release (CR) of C. aurantium EO into pectin film were determined. Further, Film packaging was tested against Rhyzopertha dominica adults reared on Karim and Khiar durum wheat (Tritichum durum Desf.) varieties. The fumigant toxicity was assessed after 10, 20, 30 and 40 days of storage. Moreover, emergence inhibition of R. dominica adults was determined. In addition, germination rate, weight loss and grain damage were examined. Results revealed that the lethal concentration that killed 50 % of the exposed adults developed into karim and khiar varieties were 278.45 and 688.79 mu L/L air, respectively. Moreover, high encapsulation efficiency of C. aurantium essential oil into pectin film with an EE = 80.6 %. Moreover, pectin: EO film achieved complete (100 %) mortality and emergence inhibition of R. dominica adults for all storage periods. Also, pectin: EO film represent the better treatment which preserve the quality and quantity of wheat grains as well as grain damage, weight loss and germination rate. To conclude: pectin- C. aurantium EO film showed a significant fumigant effect against R. dominica adults and the emergence of their descendants after different storage periods and could be recommended as an active ingredient for a natural packaging against stored product insects.",NA,744

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret ""other ingredients"" in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients.

The small particle size (158 nm) and narrow particle distribution (0.36) were obtained for the nano bio-fungicide at 20 mg of lecithin and 100 mg of surfactant concentration. The physico-chemical analysis revealed that, nano bio-fungicides were amorphous sphere-shaped nanoparticles with low melting point. The greater molecular level affinity of essential oil towards lipids and their interfacial interaction towards essential oil to achieve stabilised dispersion in aqueous environment were deciphered through molecular dynamics simulation. The unique preferential binding of eugenol, bornanone and cinnamaldehyde with the hydrocarbon chain of glycerol monostearate and phospholipid enhanced their biological stability in aqueous environment by preventing its autoxidation. It was further confirmed through accelarated ageing studies. The major components of essential oil like alpha-terpineol, linalool, thymol and cinamaldehyde had an encapsulation efficiency of 29 %, 65 %, 21 % and 50 % respectively. Subsequently, all these bioactives of essential oil follows Higuchi model of release kinetics. Besides, the essential oil loaded nanostructured lipid carrier had significantly higher mycelial growth inhibition than pure essential oil at the same concentration.

For dry inoculum products, we discuss direct implantation as an example for successful control of woody weeds, with benefits in control extending beyond the treated weeds to surrounding weeds. These applications do not require water and will become less labor-intensive with future robotic application platforms. Indeed, all bioherbicide applications are likely to improve and become more cost-effective with the advance of new application platforms with sensors and targeted control at lower application volume rates. Unmanned aerial vehicles, as new application platforms, are one of several such potential progressive application systems for liquid formulations, and we discuss product design to maintain optimum conditioning of the active ingredient(s) and storage stability. The delivery system must not adversely affect the products and the application volume rate must be appropriate for coverage on the target.

Due to their extensive application, they frequently occur in aquatic ecosystems and may affect various organisms. The active substance GLY and its major by-product, AMPA, are the most thoroughly studied chemicals; however, the adverse effects of the complex formulas of GBHs with diverse and unknown content of co-formulants are still not sufficiently researched. This study focused on the embryotoxicity, sublethal malformations, and estrogenic potency of GLY, AMPA, and four commonly used GBHs on zebrafish embryos using a wild type and an estrogen-sensitive, transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(vtg1:mCherry)).After 120 h of exposition, AMPA did not cause acute toxicity, while the LC50 of GLY was 160 mg/L. The GBHs were more toxic with LC50 values ranging from 31 to 111 GLY active equivalent (a.e.) mg/L. Exposure to 0.35-2.8 mg/L GBHs led to sublethal abnormalities: typical symptoms were structural deformation of the lower jaw and anomalies in the olfactory region. Deformity rates were 10-30% in the treated groups.In vivo, fluorescently expressed vtg1 mCherry protein in embryonic liver was detected by a non-invasive microscopic method indicating estrogenic action through vitellogenin production by GLY, AMPA, and GBHs. To confirm the in vivo findings, RT-qPCR method was performed to determine the levels of the estrogenicity-related vtg1 mRNA. After 120 h of exposure to GLY, AMPA, and three GBHs at a concentration of 0.35 mg/L, the expression of vtg1 gene was significantly up-regulated.

There is a call for development and more widespread use of sustainable alternative weed control measures. Pyrolysis liquid (PL), a by-product of charcoal and biochar production, contains numerous compounds, including organic acids, alcohols, phenols and furans. PL has shown promising results when used against several broad-leaved weeds but its effect on grassy weeds is largely untested. To provide an alternative to synthetic herbicides, PL should be effective and applicable at field scale. In this research, we initially evaluated the potential of birch (Betula sp.) based PL to control mono- and dicotyledonous plants under greenhouse conditions and determined if efficacy is improved by addition of an adjuvant. Second, the efficacy of PL for controlling Elymus repens (L.) Gould was compared with glyphosate and two other synthetic herbicides in a no-tillage system under field conditions. As expected, dicotyledonous plants were more sensitive to acid-based herbicides than monocotyledonous plants. In contrast to our expectations, the herbicidal efficacy of PL was lower than an acetic acid-based herbicide and addition of an adjuvant did not improve efficacy. In conclusion, when used at commercially and practically realistic doses, the efficacy of PL control on monocotyledonous weeds such as E. repens is weak. More product development is needed to improve PL quality and efficacy and to establish practical and cost-effective application levels for weed control on the field scale.",NA,761

Microbial spoilage and other factors such as physiological disorder, mechanical and physical damage, and fruit senescence are the major factors of postharvest loss to citrus industry. The postharvest losses in citrus are directly have negative impcats on the economy, environment and healths due to production of carbon emission gases. The fungal pathogens such as Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum and Geotrichum candidum are the major cause of postharvest spoilage in citrus fruits. These pathogens produce different mycotoxins such as citrinin, patulin, and tremorgenic. These mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of molds; they employ toxic effects on the healths. The acuteness of mytoxin on toxicity is dependings on the extent exposure, age and nutritional status of individual. The toxicity of mytoxins are directly related to the food safety and health concern including damage DNA, kidney damage, mutation in RNA/DNA, growth impairment in childs and immune system etc. Several attempts have been made to extend the shelf-life of citrus fruits by controlling physiological decay and fungal growth which has got limited success. In recent years, nanotechnology has emerged as a new strategy for shelf life prevention of citrus fruits. The biopolymer based nano-formulations functionalized with active compounds have shown promising results in maintaining the postharvest quality attributes of fruits and vegetables by retarding the moisture loss and oxidation.

Mitotic index (MI) and phase index (PI) values were used for cytotoxicity assessment. Chromosomal aberration (CA) frequencies in the dividing cells and comet data were used for genotoxicity assessment. The root growth test showed a significant concentration-based decline in root growth after abamectin exposure, with a median effective concentration (EC50) of 2.50 mg/L. Following 96-hour exposure to three concentrations of abamectin (1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mg/L), cytogenetic and comet analyses indicated a significant concentration- and time-dependent decrease in the MI, alongside an increase in DNA damage. Additionally, there was a significant concentration-dependent rise in the total frequency of CAs.

Spectroscopic methods (UV-Vis-nearIR and fluorescence) were used to assess the molecular characteristics of HM exposed to pesticides. The study showed significant differences in the molecular structures of the tested HM as a result of interactions with the pesticides used. The results revealed that PE had a different effect than the commercial products, and proved that the composition of commercial products significantly modified the strength and ability of organic matter to bind pesticides. This is probably related to the presence of adjuvants that are more competitive in forming bonds with the active sorption sites of HM, and thus strengthen or weaken the process of forming pesticide-HM complexes.

Environmental concerns surrounding such fungicides necessitate sustainable alternatives like grape cane extracts. However, studies into their efficacy and effects on the product remain limited. This study aimed to assess the open-field efficacy of a novel grape cane extract formulation, alone and combined with a copper agent, against downy mildew, and to examine its impact on berry and must composition. The results were compared to standard fungicides frequently used in integrated and organic viticulture. In 2022, the grape cane extract formulation reduced downy mildew severity by 78 % on berry clusters, comparable to the maximum acceptable dose of copper for organic farming in Germany (3 kg/ha/a). Combining the grape cane extract with the copper agent was more effective than the copper agent alone, but not more effective than the grape cane extract alone. In 2023, disease development was marginal, despite artificial inoculation. Compositional differences detectable by FTIR were insignificant between musts derived from all treatments, increased copper levels were observed whenever copper had been applied. The phenolic content in freeze-dried, de-seeded berries of 2022 was significantly lower after copper (14.6 mg/g dry weight DW) and grape cane extract treatments (6.6 mg/g DW) when compared to the control (36.1 mg/g DW), with discrepancies in stilbenoid and flavan-3-ol levels in particular, as analysed by HPLC-DAD. However, these differences were not confirmed in 2023, with results showing no correlations between different treatments and phenolic contents. These findings suggest that applications of the phenolic grape cane extract do not lead to artificially altered levels or relevant residues of the active constituents; i.e ., the phenolic compounds in the product. In brief, grape cane extracts might represent a promising natural alternative to controlling grapevine downy mildew, particularly in organic viticulture, which, to date, heavily relies on (eco-)toxic copper-pesticides.

In this work, the problem of effective polymer composite materials with fungicidal properties, which were specially developed to protect the nail from onychomycosis pathogens, was solved. The obtained results give grounds for asserting that the developed polymer composite materials have pronounced fungicidal properties against the causative agents of onychomycosis. Thanks to the optimal composition, the developed polymer materials have the ability to diffuse into the thickness of the nail. It was established that the membrane of bull hooves is the most similar in properties and chemical composition to the human nail and can be used as a model of the human nail in the study of the fungicidal activity of polymers, as well as the determination of the diffusion of active substances in the thickness of the nail. Pronounced diffusion of active substances into the composition of the nail is explained by the presence of urea in the formulation. Also, the effectiveness of the developed polymer materials is influenced by the fact that cation active surfactants, which were not previously used in antifungal agents, were used as active substances. It is shown that almost all the proposed variants of the polymer composite material with fungicidal action are effective against onychomycosis pathogens, except for the variants that contain polyhexamethylenebiguanide hydrochloride as an active substance.

The most affected biomarkers were related to a decrease in antioxidant capacity through alterations in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and the levels of malondialdehyde. Changes in energy metabolism, lipids, liver function, and xenobiotic metabolism were also identified. Furthermore, studies about the effects of 2,4-D in mixtures with other pesticides were found, as well as hepatoprotection trials. The reviewed data indicate the essential role of reduction in antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in 2,4-D-induced hepatotoxicity. However, the mechanism of action of the herbicide is still not fully understood and further research in this area is necessary.",NA,777

Amisulbrom, a quinone inside inhibitor (QiI), was evaluated for its effectiveness in clubroot management in Alberta, Canada. Resting spores of P. brassicae were treated in vitro with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10% (w/v) amisulbrom to determine its effect on spore germination and viability. Amisulbrom inhibited resting spore germination by up to 79% and reduced viable spores by 31% relative to the control. Applications of a liquid solution (AL1000, 1000 g active ingredient (ai) ha(-1)) and granular formulations (AF700, 700 g ai ha(-1); AF1000, 1000 g ai ha(-1); AF1500, 1500 g ai ha(-1)) of amisulbrom were tested on the canola cultivars '45H31' (clubroot-susceptible) and 'CS2000' (moderately resistant) under greenhouse conditions and in field experiments in 2019 and 2020. In the greenhouse, the treatments were evaluated at inoculum concentrations of 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(7) resting spores g(-1) soil. A trend of decreasing clubroot severity with an increasing amisulbrom rate was observed. At the lower spore concentration, treatment with AF1500 resulted in a clubroot disease severity index (DSI) <20% for both cultivars, while the lowest DSI under both low and high spore concentrations was obtained with AL1000. The field results indicated a significant reduction in DSI, with varied effects of rates and liquid vs. granular formulations. The greatest reductions (up to 58.3%) in DSI were obtained with AF1500 and AL1000 in 2020.

Nano-encapsulated pesticides made from nanocapsules, nanoemulsions, micelles, and nanogels outperform traditional pesticides with minimum environmental impact. Nanopesticides allowed target-based administration to decrease leaching and drainage into water bodies, and lower pesticide active component dosages. Nanocapsules with a core-shell configuration and a pesticide in the core are the most advantageous nanomaterials. Nanocapsules shield the active component. Stimuli-responsive nanocapsules may limit pesticide release by responding to pH, temperature, light, enzyme, or redox reactions. Toxicity prevents their use.

Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates; however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of statements on pesticide labels similarly diverge from published studies. We compiled 50 studies on residual toxicity trials with formulated pesticides and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to the EPA. Next, we compared our values and the EPA's values to the statements on 155 EPA registered pesticide product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under the EPA's RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants.",NA,780

However, these emerging nanopesticides need a thorough evaluation compared to current formulations to determine whether their ""nano"" properties intensify toxicity for non-target organisms. This study assessed the lethal toxicity of three nanopesticides on Daphnia magna. The nanopesticides tested were tebuconazole loaded onto poly-epsilon-caprolactone, nanostructured lipid carriers, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles. Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers. The observed toxicity levels, from highest to lowest, were as follows: pure tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on nanostructured lipid carriers > commercial tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles > tebuconazole-loaded on poly-epsilon-caprolactone. The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling.

Methods Forty-five naturally infested cattle were divided into three experimental groups: T01, treated with fluralaner (2.5 mg/kg) pour-on every 42 days; T02, the cattle received the first treatment with fluralaner on Day 0 but the next treatment involved a weekly visual evaluation; T03, control, received palliative treatment with a spray formulation when the group mean was >= 30 ticks. Counts of female R. microplus were performed weekly until day 343, and larval counts on pasture were performed on Days 0, 30, and 60 and every 30 days until Day 330. Results Using fluralaner, six applications were performed in Group T01, and four were performed in Group T02. In the control group (T03), it was necessary to perform eight palliative acaricide treatments with the spray formulation. The animals in T01 and T02 showed lower mean tick counts (p <= 0.05) than the control group (T03) on 28 and 27 of the 49 evaluated dates, respectively. In the paddock where the animals were kept as controls, the R. microplus larvae counts increased to 1458. In the paddocks where the animals were treated with fluralaner, the number was <= 19 per paddock during the study. Conclusions The different strategic treatment protocols performed with pour-on fluralaner (2.5 mg/kg) over a year in taurine cattle in a tropical region with a history of up to five annual generations of cattle ticks were effective, maintaining levels of R. microplus infestations in animals and in pastures close to zero in most of the study. Depending on the retreatment criterion adopted, the number of applications per year may be lower, resulting in a reduction in the mean cost of acaricide treatment per year and lower exposure of R. microplus populations to the active ingredient, resulting in lower resistance and selection pressure.",NA,782

Five plant EOs (cinnamon, cypress, lavender, lemon eucalyptus and tea tree) and their major constituents (cinnamaldehyde, citronellal, beta-cymene, (R)-linalool, and alpha-terpinyl acetate) were investigated against adults of Culex pipiens. The efficacy of the tested compounds was manipulated as mortality and knockdown using a fumigation technique. After that, the most active compounds against adults (lemon eucalyptus oil and linalool) were investigated once more as repellents after incorporating them on a cream base against C. pipiens adults compared to their nano-cream using arm-in-cage technique. In addition, the biochemical and histological effects of dermal treatment of linalool, lemon eucalyptus,, and their nanoemulsions (NEs) were studied on male albino rats. Total protein assay, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and liver and kidney functions were determined in blood serum. Complete blood count (CBC) was determined in whole blood. The results showed that lemon eucalyptus oil and (R)-linalool caused the highest knockdown activity against C. pipiens adults with Kt(50) 40.29 s and 12.73 s, respectively. The repellent effect (RC50) of nanocream formulations of lemon eucalyptus oil (10.03 mg/L) and (R)-linalool (68.11 mg/L) were higher than the original effects of these compounds with RC50 values = 100.82 mg/L and 998.54 mg/L, respectively.

Recent years have seen a surge in tick-borne diseases (TBD) resulting in a high demand for tick management products. Plants offer a valuable source of active compounds for the development of novel, eco-friendly tick control products, reducing potential risks to human and animal health. Essential oils (EOs) have emerged as potential acaricides and repellents against ticks providing an alternative to synthetic chemicals and aiding in the prevention of TBD by lowering the risk of tick bites. We investigated the acaricidal activity of EOs from lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), geranium (Pelargonium x asperum), savory thyme (Thymus saturejoides), and white thyme (Thymus zygis) on I. scapularis. The interactions (i.e., synergistic, antagonistic, or additive) of their binary mixtures were also evaluated. EO samples were analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine their chemical composition. The adult immersion test was used to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) of each EO alone and in mixtures. Quantitative assessment of synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect of the binary mixtures was performed by calculating the combination index. Strong acaricidal activity was recorded for savory thyme and white thyme EOs, with LC50 values of 28.0 and 11.0 mu g/mu L, respectively. The LC50 of lemongrass and geranium EOs were 49.0 and 39.7 mu g/mu L, respectively. Among the tested EOs, savory thyme and white thyme had a strong acaricidal effect on I. scapularis, which might be linked to the presence of carvacrol (26.05 % +/- 0.38) and thymol (53.6 % +/- 2.31), main components present in savory thyme and white thyme EOs, respectively. The tick killing efficacy of lemongrass and geranium EOs was lower when mixed than when used separately (LC50 of 65.3 mu g/mu L). The same happened with savory thyme and white thyme EOs, except at 9.75 mu g/ mu L where they had a synergistic effect (LC50 of 58.3 mu g/mu L). Lemongrass and savory thyme EOs had a synergistic effect at low concentrations, and an antagonistic effect at higher concentrations (LC50 of 95.4 mu g/mu L). Lemongrass and white thyme EOs had a synergistic effect against ticks from 15 to 120 mu g/mu L (LC50 of 18.5 mu g/mu L) similar to white thyme EO. Geranium and savory thyme EOs had an antagonistic effect at all concentrations, with an LC50 of 66.8 mu g/mu L. Geranium and white thyme EOs also had an antagonistic effect, except at 12.7 mu g/mu L where they had a synergistic effect (LC50 of 66.8 mu g/mu L).

Zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate active ingredient and glyphosate-based formulation were under oxidative stress, but only the commercial formulation delayed the embryogenesis, affected the cholinergic neurotransmission and induced DNA damage. Both altered the motor performance of larvae at very low concentrations, becoming larvae hypoactive. The energy balance was also impaired, as embryos under oxidative stress had lower lipids reserves.

Acute toxicity assays revealed that the PC@MSNs were less toxic to aquatic life (LC50 = 257.867 mg/L) and that the formulation showed no adverse effects on rice seedling growth. In summary, these results suggest that PC@MSNs can broaden PC's scope of application in managing rice diseases.",NA,792

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world's most used pesticides, but until recent years they have been claimed to be safe for non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Using controlled arena experiments, we investigated the effects on the learning and long-term memory of buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), of a single field-realistic dose of glyphosate, both in its pure form and as a commercial herbicide (Roundup Gold) containing the active ingredient (a.i.) glyphosate and other co-formulants. We found that glyphosate in its pure form caused deterioration in the learning ability of bumblebees in a 10-color discrimination experiment; the glyphosate-treated bees discriminated colors over 10% worse than the untreated control bees. However, the commercially used GBH (Roundup Gold) had no observable effect on the learning ability of the bumblebees, despite the fact that this herbicide contained the same amount of glyphosate as its pure form. These findings shed light on the potential risks associated with agrochemicals previously considered safe for pollinators and emphasize the need for comprehensive risk assessments of pesticides, including evaluations of cognitive functions in pollinators. Therefore, we propose that future pesticide testing should incorporate broader assessments to ensure the safety of pollinators in agricultural landscapes.",NA,793

However, although many studies have demonstrated the toxic and repellent effect of EOs against harmful insects, some studies indicate that EOs can act, on the contrary, as attractants for harmful insects. In the practical use of EOs as active ingredients in insecticidal/repellent formulations, these contrasting effects may generate unexpected responses from insects. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that EOs may act in a hormesis biphasic concentration-response effect characterized by a lowconcentration stimulation (attraction) and a high-concentration inhibition (repulsion) of the insect chemotaxis. For this purpose, the EOs obtained from twelve aromatic plant species belonging to eight botanical families were chemically characterized and tested for their toxicity (by fumigation) and attractiveness or repellence (by two-choice olfactometer bioassays) against the stored cereals pest Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). EO compositions were variable both qualitatively and quantitatively: while phenylpropanoids were the most represented chemical class in the EOs of Cinnamomum verum, Myristica fragrans, Ocimum basilicum, Piper aduncum, and Syzygium aromaticum, monoterpene hydrocarbons dominated the Citrus aurantium and Citrus reticulata EOs compositions, and they represented over 60% of the Schinus molle EO; the Clinopodium nubigenum and Clinopodium tomentosum EOs, as well as the Elettaria cardamomum EO, were mainly rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, while Piper nigrum was the only species among those studied whose EO composition was mainly represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Toxicity tests showed a wide range of activity among the tested EOs, with LC50 values ranging from 2.19 to 218.32 mu L L-1 for C. nubigenum and C. verum EOs, respectively. Behavioral tests showed that C. aurantium, C. nubigenum, C. tomentosum, and O. basilicum EOs exerted an overall repellent effect, which was significant at concentrations ranging from 1.19 to 23.87 mu L EO L-1 air. Conversely, C. verum and S. aromaticum EOs were predominantly attractive, with a significant attractiveness in the range of concentrations from 2.39 to 11.94 and at 23.87 mu L EO L-1 air, respectively. However, half of the tested EOs (C. reticulata, E. cardamomum, M. fragrans, P. aduncum, P. nigrum, and S. molle) showed both negative and positive chemotaxis depending on the EO concentration. Overall, the results indicated that EOs can exert attractive and repellent activity depending on their chemical composition and concentration. Since EOs contain volatile substances whose concentration varies over time after the application, the implication of these results will be discussed in relation to their possible use as insect repellents for active packaging or as attractive lures for trapping.",NA,794

Globally, more than 2000 commercial GLY-based herbicides (GBHs) are used to control weeds. Non-target organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real environmental conditions, but the co-formulants contained in GBHs are classified as so-called inert and inactive ingredients in terms of their biological effects. The main objective of this comprehensive review is to compile the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies on the side-effects of GLY, GBHs, and their formulating agents. Based on the results demonstrated for a variety of plant and animal aquatic organisms, oxidative stress appears to be a major trigger for these adverse effects, affecting the integrity of DNA and other biochemical functions. Furthermore, there is evidence of impairment of various physiological and behavioral functions. Adverse effects of GLY and GBHs have been observed even at very low concentrations. There are also differences in the sensitivity of the aquatic organisms tested, even with similar lifestyles, habitats or identical taxa. The studies typically investigate the short-term effects of a single exposure to GLY/GBH on a single species, whilst in reality multiple applications of GBHs together with other pesticides are common during a cropping cycle. Moreover, the interactions between GLY/GBHs and other aquatic contaminants are rarely studied. Higher toxicity of GBHs compared to GLY alone has often been observed, demonstrating that co-formulants can be highly toxic on their own and markedly increase the toxicity of the GBH formulation. The possible impurities in GBHs, such as heavy metals, can cause additional problems for the environment and food safety. The widespread and massive use of GBHs leads to increased exposure and environmental hazards. In addition, the need for a revision of the risk assessment system is emphasized. According to the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies, the current use and pollution of the aquatic environment by GLY/GBHs is highly problematic and cannot be considered environmentally sustainable. It is, therefore, necessary to at least tighten the permitted forms of use.",NA,795

Researchers of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico) and Switzerland (workshop initiator) held presentations about occurrence and effects of pesticides on the environment, human health, the replacement of highly hazardous pesticides (HHP) by agroecological alternatives and the agri-food value chain. In a subsequent round table discussion, the presenters identified deficits, needs, interests and opportunities. According to them, the lack of awareness of pesticide use affects the health and safety of workers applying the chemicals. Despite Latin America representing the main agricultural area in the world with a very intense pesticide use, monitoring data of pesticides in soil, surface and groundwaters, food, as well as in humans are missing. Risks of pesticides to humans should be assessed so that authorities can withdraw or limit within ""short time"" the access to corresponding formulations on the market. Also, communication is not state of the art and should be improved as, e.g. the teaching of workers and farmers, how to correctly use and apply pesticides or the briefing of decision makers. Pollinators suffer from multiple stressors not the least due to pesticides, and alternatives are badly needed. On the technical side, the different analytical methods to determine residues of active ingredients and transformation products in matrices of concern should be harmonized among laboratories. Seven future actions and goals were identified to overcome the above deficits. Next steps after the publishing of this conference report are to harmonize and complete the information status of the presenters by exchanging the results/data already present. Therefore, a platform of interaction to address issues described above and to enhance collaboration shall be created. Samples of different matrices shall be exchanged to harmonize the chemical analysis and establish interlaboratory comparisons. Such activities might be facilitated by joining international associations or organizations, where researchers can offer their expertise, or by forming a new pesticide network for Central and South America that could present tailored projects to national and international organizations and funding agencies.",NA,796

A sorbent combination based on ENVI-Carb and ChloroFiltr was examined. A highly efficient method was developed for the purification of plant extracts with 900 mg MgSO4, 150 mg PSA, and 15 mg ENVICarb at the d-SPE stage, combined with gas chromatography and liquid tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of 197 pesticides in crop plants containing chlorophyll.

However, the potential ecotoxicological and endocrine-disrupting risks of TSEOn congeners have recently attracted ever-growing concern. Above all, there is limited research on the concentration levels of TSEOn in agroecosystems. This study, simultaneous analysis of 39 TSEOn oligomers in citrus orchard soils in China was implemented by the modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) extraction coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The method detection limits (MDLs) and the method quantification limits (MQLs) for TSEOn were 0.003-0.07 mu g/kg and 0.01-0.20 mu g/kg, respectively. The recoveries for TSEOn oligomers in soils ranged from 81 % similar to 106 % with related standard deviations (RSDs) < 7 %. This newly developed UPLC-MS/MS method with high sensitivity and stability allows us to successfully trace the occurrence of TSEOn congeners in the citrus orchard soils from 3 provinces and 1 municipality in China. The detected concentrations of TSEOn-H oligomers in the sampled soils ranged from 0.02 to 0.288 mu g/kg (dry weight). The congener profiles of TSEOn-H were dominated by TSEOn-H (n = 6- 8) in the soils. Additionally, the total concentrations of TSEOn-H congeners (Sigma TSEOn-H) in the soils were in the range of 0.03 to 1.49 mu g/kg. A comparison of Sigma TSEOn-H distribution among the different citrus orchard soils indicated a higher level of Sigma TSEOn-H in the soil samples collected from Zhejiang Province.

Miami-Dade County, Florida is part of one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, supports Cx. quinquefasciatus year-round, and recently experienced over 60 human cases of WNV during one outbreak. To facilitate more effective integrated vector management and public health protection, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassay method to evaluate the susceptibility of adult Cx. quinquefasciatus collected from 29 locations throughout Miami-Dade County to pyrethroid and organophosphate adulticide active ingredients (AIs) used by Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control. We also determined the frequency of the 1014 knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation for Cx. quinquefasciatus from a subset of 17 locations. We detected resistance to two pyrethroid AIs in all tested locations (permethrin: 27 locations, deltamethrin: 28 locations). The 1014F allele was widely distributed throughout all 17 locations sampled; however, 29.4% of these locations lacked 1014F homozygotes even though phenotypic pyrethroid resistance was present. Organophosphate resistance was more variable; 20.7% of the locations tested were susceptible to malathion, and 33.3% of the populations were susceptible to naled. We subsequently conducted a field trial of ReMoa Tri, a recently approved multiple AI adulticide formulation labelled for resistant mosquitoes, against a mixed location field population of Miami-Dade Cx. quinquefasciatus.

However, under European Union and United States law, the full details of the co-formulant composition are kept secret from the public and researchers. Only the producer and regulators know the full details. Here I argue that legislators should end 'coformulant secrecy' and require all the ingredients in a pesticide be listed openly, including their concentrations. To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition. Further, patents are already utilised, so secrecy adds no additional benefit to industry. I argue that co-formulant secrecy only serves to stifte and limit the ability of independent scientists to conduct research.",NA,800

Calibrating the PT can be time-consuming, and the dosing of surfaces may not be as accurate or uniform as previously assumed.MethodsTo address these limitations, the Micron Horizontal Track Sprayer with Spray Cabinet (TS) was developed to provide higher efficiency, ease of operation and deposition uniformity equal to or better than the PT. A series of studies were performed using a fluorescent tracer and three IRS formulations (Actellic (R) 300CS, K-Othrine WG250 and Suspend PolyZone) sprayed onto surfaces using either the PT or the TS.ResultsDeposition volumes could be accurately calibrated for both spray systems. However, the uniformity of spray deposits was higher for the TS compared to the PT. Less than 12% of the volume sprayed using the PT reaches the target surface, with the remaining 88% unaccounted for, presumably vented out of the fume hood or coating the internal surfaces of the tower. In contrast, the TS deposits most of the spray on the floor of the spray chamber, with the rest contained therein. The total sprayed surface area in one run of the TS is 1.2 m2, and the operational zone for spray target placement is 0.7 m2, meaning that 58% of the applied volume deposits onto the targets. The TS can treat multiple surfaces (18 standard 15 x 15 cm tiles) in a single application, whereas the PT treats one surface at a time and a maximum area of around 0.0225 m2. An assessment of the time taken to perform spraying, including the setup, calibration and cleaning, showed that the cost of application using the TS was around 25-35 x less per tile sprayed. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for calibration and use of both the Potter Tower and Track Sprayer have been developed.ConclusionsOverall, the TS represents a significant improvement over the PT in terms of the efficiency and accuracy of IRS formulation applications onto test substrates and offers a useful additional tool for researchers and manufacturers wanting to screen new active ingredients or evaluate the efficacy of IRS or other sprayable formulations for insect control.",NA,801

To maximise the effectiveness of CRFs however, it is crucial to understand the herbicide-releasing behaviour at play, which predominately depends on the interaction mechanisms between active ingredients and carrier materials during adsorption. In this study, we investigated and modelled the adsorption characteristics of model herbicide 2,4-D onto two organo-montmorillonites (octadecylamine- and aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified) to synthesise polymer-based CRFs. Herbicide-releasing behaviour of the synthesised CRF microbeads was then analysed under various experimental conditions, and weed control efficacy determined under glasshouse conditions. Results revealed that adsorption of 2,4-D onto both organo-montmorillonites follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and is predominately controlled by the chemisorption process. However, multi-step mechanisms were detected in the adsorption on both organoclays, hence intra-particle diffusion is not the sole rate-limiting step for the adsorption process. Both organoclays followed the Elovich model, suggesting they have energetically heterogeneous surfaces. Herbicide-releasing behaviours of synthesised beads were investigated at various pH temperatures and ionic strengths under laboratory and glasshouse conditions. Furthermore, weed control efficacy of synthesised beads were investigated using pot studies under glasshouse condition. Desorption studies revealed that both synthesised microbeads have slow releasing behaviour at a wide range of pHs (5-9), temperatures (25-45 degrees C), and ionic strengths.

This research was conducted with the aim of assessing the sensitivity of Botrytis cinerea to five fungicide formulations (active ingredients: boscalid, cyprodinil + fludioxonil, fenpyrazamine, fenhexamid, and pyrimethanil), four of which have been registered and used for more than 10 years in Croatia. Even at the highest concentrations tested, pyrimethanil, boscalid and fenhexamid caused fungal inhibition at a rate significantly lower than 90%. Conversely, cyprodinil + fludioxonil had inhibition rates greater than 90% for 72% of the isolates.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassays used to assess insecticide resistance are based on residual active ingredient (AI) exposure and do not directly relate to FP efficacy. The current pilot study developed a novel compact wind tunnel for mosquito exposure to FP. Caged Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens/quinquefasciatus were exposed to undiluted Biomist (R) 3+15 FP (permethrin AI) or air (control) within the wind tunnel, transferred to new cages, and held in a 28 degrees C incubator. Separate mosquitoes were exposed to residual permethrin AI (8 mu gmL(-1)) in bottle bioassays. Mortality was monitored 15, 30, 60, and 120min post-exposure. RESULTS: Chi-square tests (P<0.05) showed significantly higher mortality in Aedes compared to Culex populations for most time points in both bioassay and wind tunnel exposure groups. As expected, mosquitoes exposed to Biomist (R) 3+15 showed higher mortality rates than bottle bioassay exposure to permethrin. Two Culex colonies resistant to permethrin in bottle bioassays were susceptible to Biomist (R) 3+15 in the wind tunnel. CONCLUSION: The novel compact wind tunnel developed here may be an alternative to field trials for testing FP efficacy, avoiding factors such as weather, logistical planning, and extended personnel hours. The wind tunnel could allow programs to conveniently test efficacy of multiple FP. Comparisons of different insecticide exposure methods provide practical information to inform operational decisions.

However, more information is needed to know about the behavior of nanopesticides in media used for ecotoxicological tests. In this work, the release and stability of two tebuconazole (TBZ) nanoformulations (TBZ loaded into poly-epsilon-caprolactone [PCL] or into nano-lipids [NLC]) were evaluated in Milli-Q water (control) and two media used broadly in ecotoxicological tests: reconstituted water (RCW) and Elendt M7 solution. The results suggested that the release of TBZ depended mainly on the TBZ concentration in the system with faster release at lower concentration levels. TBZ release was also influenced by the type of nanocarrier. For instance, for RCW and concentration of 50 mu g mL-1, TBZ release from NLC (plateau% = 44.7 +/- 2.6) was higher than from PCL (plateau% = 17.8 +/- 2.6). Similar trends were also found for other concentrations and the other medium, M7. The colloidal stability of the nanoformulations declined as the concentration of the stabilizing agents decreased. Our results show that it is essential to consider the factors that could influence both the release and stability of the nanopesticides in ecotoxicological media since these phenomena can affect the exposure of organisms to pesticides and, therefore, the results of ecotoxicological tests.

Various approaches to weed management are commonly practiced by crop growers. Due to limitations in other control methods, farmers often choose herbicides as a cost-effective, rapid and highly efficient weed control strategy. Although herbicides are highly effective on most weeds, they are not a complete solution for weed management because of the genetic diversity and evolving flexibility of weed communities. The excessive and indiscriminate use of herbicides and their dominance in weed control have triggered the rapid generation of herbicide-resistant weed species. Moreover, environmental losses of active ingredients in the herbicides cause serious damage to the environment and pose a serious threat to living organisms. Scientific advances have enabled nanotechnology to emerge as an innovation with real potential in modern agriculture, adding a new dimension in the preparation of controlled release formulations (CRF) of herbicides. Here the required amount of active ingredients is released over longer periods of time to obtain the desired biological efficacy whilst reducing the harmful effects of these chemicals.

The efficacy of commercial products with two species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, was investigated against adults of the grey maize weevil under laboratory conditions. Nemastar (R), containing S. carpocapsae was more effective on T. dilaticollis adults than Nematop (R) containing H. bacteriophora, when applied uniformly to the surface of the soil, on Petri dishes containing T. dilaticollis adults. Results showed that S. carpocapsae rates of 83-333 infective juveniles/adult caused > 94% mortality in T. dilaticollis adults, whereas H. bacteriophora caused 27-61%, adult mortality, after exposure of insects to the commercial products of EPNs for 15 days. The infection rates of EPNs increased with concentration applied and ranged from 70-83% and 19-64% for Nemastar (R) and Nematop (R), respectively. Subsequent field and semi-field tests were conducted with Nemastar (R) (application rate of 50 million S. carpocapsae per 100 m(2)) in maize crops with biological (mycoinsecticide Naturalis (R), biofungicides and fertilizers) and chemical seed treatment (Gaucho (R) FS 600; active ingredient: imidacloprid) in Knezha, Bulgaria. Nematodes were found only in the dead specimens, in open plots and cages sprayed with the commercial nematode product. Nematode sprayings contributed for higher maize yields in the open maize plots in the fields with different seed treatments. We suggest that the use of powder formulation of S. carpocapsae in combination with biologically treated maize seeds can contribute to minimize the use of chemical insecticides against the grey maize weevil. The results obtained can be used as a base to further tests to ascertain the efficacy of EPNs products before they can be recommended for use in the integrated approach to T. dilaticollis management.",NA,808

However, little is known about the separate effects of the active ingredient (CPF) and adjuvants (AD). We studied the thermal sensitivity at different concentrations and pesticide fractions in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles, on thermal tolerance limits (CT max = Critical thermal maximum and CT min = Critical thermal minimum), swimming speed (S s ), Optimum temperature (T o p ), and Thermal breadth 50 (B 50 ). Our results demonstrate that the pesticide active ingredient, the adjuvants, and the commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos differentially impair the thermal sensitivity of R. arenarum tadpoles. The pesticide fractions affected the heat and the cold tolerance (CT max and CT min ), depending on the concentrations they were exposed to. The locomotor performance (S s , T op , and B 50 ) of tadpoles also varied among fractions, treatments, and environmental temperatures. In the context of climate change, the outcomes presented are particularly relevant, as mean temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates, which suggests that tadpoles inhabiting warming and polluted ponds are currently experiencing deleterious conditions. Considering that larval stages of amphibians are the most susceptible to changing environmental conditions and the alarming predictions about environmental temperatures in the future, it is likely that the synergism between high temperatures and pesticide exposure raise the threat of population deletions in the coming years.",NA,809

Repellents reduce the risk of housefly vector diseases. Green repellents from plant essential oils (EOs) and their active compounds were, at the time, a promising option against houseflies. This study evaluated the housefly-repellent activities of every tested EO, their main constituents, and several combinations of them. The combinations were lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) EO + trans-anethole, lemongrass EO + star anise (Illicium verum) EO, geranial + trans-anethole, and star anise EO + geranial. The efficacies of every formulation were compared against each other and DEET (a synthetic repellent). All combinations were more effective in repellency than all single-component formulations and DEET. More significantly, all of them were safe for four non-target species: guppy (Poecilia reticulata), molly (Poecilia latipinna), dwarf honeybee (Apis florea), and stingless bee (Tetragonula pagdeni). These combinations could be developed into valuable green repellents for housefly vector disease management.Abstract The present study evaluated the housefly repellency of single-component formulations and combinations of lemongrass and star anise essential oils (EOs) and their main constituents. The efficacies of the combinations were compared against those of single-component formulations and DEET. Safety bioassays of all formulations and DEET on non-target species-guppy, molly, dwarf honeybee, and stingless bee-were conducted. GC-MS analysis showed that the main constituent of lemongrass EO was geranial (46.83%) and that of star anise EO was trans-anethole (92.88%). All combinations were highly synergistic compared to single-component formulations, with an increased repellent value (IR) of 34.6 to 51.2%. The greatest synergistic effect was achieved by 1.0% lemongrass EO + 1.0% trans-anethole combination, with an IR of 51.2%. The strongest, 100% repellent rate at 6 h was achieved by 1.0% geranial + 1.0% trans-anethole. They were twice as effective as DEET and caused obvious damage to housefly antennae under microscopic observation. All single-component formulations and combinations were benign to the four tested non-target species. In contrast, DEET was highly toxic to them. The synergistic repellency and biosafety of these two combinations are compellingly strong support for developing them into an effective green repellent.",NA,812

Recent studies sponsored by The Hartz Mountain Corporation, confirm the safety of TCVP as an active ingredient in pet collars. Based upon data from these new studies and results previously relied upon by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the following conclusions have been made: (1) Torsion study data clearly indicate that approximately 93% of released formulation from TCVP containing pet collars is in a liquid phase immediately following activation. (2) Further, even more relevant to human health risk analysis associated with post-application exposures, in vivo data from dogs wearing TCVP pet collars definitively document that TCVP dust released from the collar is rapidly absorbed into the sebum. The maximum ratio of dust to liquid was 0.023% dust to 99.977% liquid. (3) In vivo fur data provide scientific evidence confirming that the mechanism of dissemination of TCVP from pet collars is as a liquid suspended or dissolved in the animal's sebum, even though it may be released from the collar as a solid. Thus, potential post-application exposure to TCVP, including immediately following collar placement, is almost entirely to a liquid phase.

Two forms of phase-different nanodelivery systems of layered double hydroxide LDH and oil/water nanoemulsions were formulated. The synthesized nanoemulsions showed particle sizes of 199 and 333 nm for AJ-NE and PP-NE, with a polydispersity index of 0.249 and 0.198, respectively. Chemical and physiochemical analysis of TEM, SEM, XRD, zeta potential, drug loading capacity, and drug release measurements were done to confirm the synthesis and loading efficiencies of essential oils' active ingredients.

Granivorous birds like the Red -legged Partridge ( Alectoris rufa ) have high exposure risk because they ingest treated seeds that remain on the field surface. As triazole fungicides can act as endocrine disruptors, affecting sterol synthesis and reproduction in birds several months after exposure, we hypothesized that these effects could also impact subsequent generations of exposed birds. To test this hypothesis, we exposed adult partridges (F0) to seeds treated at commercial doses with four different formulations containing triazoles as active ingredients (flutriafol, prothioconazole, tebuconazole, and a mixture of the latter two), simulating field exposure during late autumn sowing. During the subsequent reproductive season, two to four months after exposure, we examined compound allocation of steroid hormones, cholesterol, vitamins, and carotenoids in eggs laid by exposed birds (F1), as well as the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis in one -day -old chicks of this F1. One year later, F1 animals were paired again to investigate the expression of the same genes in the F2 chicks. We found changes in the expression of some genes for all treatments and both generations. Additionally, we observed an increase in estrone levels in eggs from partridges treated with flutriafol compared to controls, a decrease in tocopherol levels in partridges exposed to the mixture of tebuconazole and prothioconazole, and an increase in retinol levels in partridges exposed to prothioconazole. Despite sample size limitations, this study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of action of the previously observed effects of triazole fungicide -treated seeds on avian reproduction with evidence that the effects can persist beyond the exposure windows, affecting unexposed offspring of partridges fed with treated seeds.

We have previously shown that consumption of field-realistic levels of this fungicide shortens worker lifespan in the field and impairs associative learning performance in a laboratory-based assay. We hypothesized that Pristine would also impair homing and foraging behaviours in the field, and that an interaction with hot weather would exacerbate this effect. Both field-relevant Pristine exposure and higher air temperatures reduced the probability of successful return on their own. Together, the two factors synergistically reduced the probability of return and increased the time required for bees to return to the hive.

In this study, the effects of Merlin Flexx- and Merlin WG75 formulated isoxaflutole-based herbicide products and two selected additives (cyprosulfamide safener and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one antimicrobial agent) were investigated on Raphidocelis subcapitata in growth inhibition assays. In ecotoxicological tests, two conventional (optical density and chlorophyll-a content) and two induced fluorescence-based (Fv*/Fp: efficiency of the photosystem PSII and Rfd* changes in the observed ratio of fluorescence decrease) endpoints were determined by UV-spectrophotometer and by our FluoroMeter Module, respectively. Furthermore, dissipation of isoxaflutole alone and in its formulated products was examined by an HPLC-UV method. In ecotoxicological assays, the fluorescence-based Rfd* was observed as the most sensitive endpoint. In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole-safener-antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 +/- 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i.

This research aimed to study the influence of biopolymer in hydrogel capsules on survival and shelf-life of T. koningiopsis. Thus, two hydrogel capsules prototypes based on alginate (P1) and amidated pectin (P2), containing conidia of T. koningiopsis Th003 were formulated.

The biting midge Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is an important pest of livestock in much of the United States and larval midges utilize semi-aquatic habitats which are permissive for Bti product application. Reports suggest that Bti products are ineffective at killing biting midges despite their taxonomic relation to black flies and mosquitoes. Here, we investigate the toxicity of a Bti-based commercial insecticide and its active ingredient in larval Culicoides sonorensis. A suspected mechanism of Bti tolerance is an acidic larval gut, and we used a pH indicator dye to examine larval Culicoides sonorensis gut pH after exposure to Bti. RESULTSThe lethal concentration to kill 90% (LC90) of larvae of the commercial product (386 mg/L) was determined to be almost 10 000 times more than that of some mosquito species, and no concentration of active ingredient tested achieved 50% larval mortality. The larval gut was found to be more acidic after exposure to Bti which inhibits Bti toxin activity. By comparison, 100% mortality was achieved in larval Aedes aegypti at the product's label rate for this species and mosquito larvae had alkaline guts regardless of treatment. Altering the larval rearing water to alkaline conditions enhanced Bti efficacy when using the active ingredient. CONCLUSIONWe conclude that Bti is not practical for larval Culicoides sonorensis control at the same rates as mosquitos but show that alterations or additives to the environment could make the products more effective.

The GBH crop spraying, dedicated to genetically engineered GLP-resistant crops, has revolutionized modern agriculture by increasing the production yield. However, abusively administered GBHs' ingredients, e.g., GLP, polyoxyethyleneamine, and heavy metals, have polluted environmental and industrial areas far beyond farmlands, causing global contamination and life-threatening risk, which has led to the recent local bans of GBH use. Moreover, preclinical and clinical reports have demonstrated harmful impacts of GLP and other GBH ingredients on the gut microbiome, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and endocrine, as well as reproductive, and cardiopulmonary systems, whereas carcinogenicity of these herbicides remains controversial. Occupational exposure to GBH dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, responsible for steroidogenesis and endocrinal secretion, thus affecting hormonal homeostasis, functions of reproductive organs, and fertility. On the other hand, acute intoxication with GBH, characterized by dehydration, oliguria, paralytic ileus, as well as hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, may occur fatally.

Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption.

Over the past several decades, isolates of P. capsici exhibiting resistance to mefenoxam and other fungicides have been reported. Fungicide resistance coupled with an increased market for organically grown crops has led to interest in biological control as a disease management option. In this work, an isolate of Bacillus subtilis (AFS032321) was evaluated for control of Phytophthora blight of bell pepper in the greenhouse and field. A 28% active ingredient wettable powder formulation of the strain was applied as a soil drench at transplanting prior to inoculation. Treatment with this formulation of B. subtilis significantly reduced the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) by up to 52% compared to untreated control plants in greenhouse tests. Comparisons between applying the biocontrol weekly after seeding for 5 weeks versus a single application at transplanting (5 weeks) indicated no significant benefits of additional applications. The formulation of B. subtilis reduced disease caused by a mefenoxam-resistant isolate of P. capsici, while mefenoxam failed. The biocontrol efficacy of formulated strains was not affected in different soil types or potting media. However, disease was more severe in sandy soils. In field experiments that were conducted with a mefenoxam-sensitive isolate, disease incidence and severity of Phytophthora blight were significantly reduced at all rates of B. subtilis in 2019 except the 16.8 kg ha(-1) rate. In both years, mefenoxam was more effective than B. subtilis in controlling disease in the field. B. subtilis did not affect the spatial dynamics of pathogen spread within rows. While the precise mechanism(s) of action is unclear, in vitro dual-culture tests suggest direct antagonism, as B. subtilis significantly inhibited colony growth of P. capsici.

Fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) is a novel acaricide that has recently been utilised for treating mange in wombats. The topical 'spot-on' formulation of fluralaner can limit treatment delivery options in situ, but dilution to a volume for 'pour-on' delivery is one practicable solution. This study investigated the in vitro acaricidal activity of Bravecto, a proposed essential oil-based diluent (Orange Power (R)), and two of its active constituents, limonene and citral, against Sarcoptes scabiei. Methods Sarcoptes scabiei were sourced from experimentally infested pigs. In vitro assays were performed to determine the lethal concentration (LC50) and survival time of the mites when exposed to varying concentrations of the test solutions. Results All compounds were highly effective at killing mites in vitro. The LC50 values of Bravecto, Orange Power, limonene and citral at 1 h were 14.61 mg/ml, 4.50%, 26.53% and 0.76%, respectively. The median survival times of mites exposed to undiluted Bravecto, Orange Power and their combination were 15, 5 and 10 min, respectively. A pilot survival assay of mites collected from a mange-affected wombat showed survival times of < 10 min when exposed to Bravecto and Orange Power and 20 min when exposed to moxidectin. Conclusions These results confirm the acaricidal properties of Bravecto, demonstrate acaricidal properties of Orange Power and support the potential suitability of Orange Power and its active constituents as a diluent for Bravecto. As well as killing mites via direct exposure, Orange Power could potentially enhance the topical delivery of Bravecto to wombats by increasing drug penetration in hyperkeratotic crusts.

Moreover to assess the efficacy of the developed microemulsion in comparison to the convention alone against the Egyptian cotton leaf worm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) under both laboratory and field conditions. The results showed that the optimum conditions for emamectin benzoate microemulsion was 2% active ingredient, 5% (w/w) ethyl acetate, and DMF (3:2), 3.5% (w/w) Geronol ff4 and Etocas 35 (6:1), 5% (w/w) ethanol, and 86.5% (w/w) water, while for beta-cyfluthrin, a 5.0% active ingredient, 15% (w/w) Solvesso 100 and ethyl acetate (2:1), 7.0% (w/w) Geronol ff4 and Etocas 35 (6:1), 10% (w/w) ethanol, and 68% (w/w) water. Under laboratory conditions, emamectin benzoate was more toxic than beta-cyfluthrin to Spodoptera littoralis second and fourth instar larvae. Emamectin benzoate was more effective that beta-cyfluthrin against Spodoptera littoralis in the field, whether as a microemulsion or a commercial product. Thus, microemulsions of tested insecticides with better formulation qualities may be more effective than traditional ones in controlling cotton leaf worm.",NA,841

The use of pesticide carriers to deliver pesticides can help to prevent rapid release, assist in targeted release, and improve pesticide utilization. However, after completing pesticide delivery, less part of pesticide carriers has more functions and may remain in the environment, leading to material waste and environmental burden. Here, we propose that the environment -friendly carrier materials for pesticide delivery can synergistically enhance control efficacy with pesticides. Based on the bio-stimulant polyglutamic acid, amphiphilic polymers (mPEG-b-PLG) were constructed, and they assembled into nano micelle. After encapsulating prothioconazole (PTC) into the nano micelle through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions through co -assembly, mPEG-b-PLG-PTC nanospheres with a diameter of approximately 120 nm were prepared. The nanospheres exhibit pH responsiveness for targeted release of pesticides, as well as excellent retention capacity, droplet bounce inhibition ability, and deposition capacity. At the same time, compared with commercial formulations, it has long-term antifungal properties and lower EC50, while its acute toxicity to human cells is lower, which can reduce cell apoptosis by about 63 %. It is also gratifying that the main root length, plant height, and fresh weight of wheat seedlings treated with mPEG-b-PLG have significantly improved, effectively applying carrier materials for synergistic effects. In summary, this work proposes a promising strategy to synergize pesticide carrier materials as active ingredients, providing new ideas for the integration of pesticide and fertilizer, improving pesticide utilization efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution.",NA,842

Several important fabricated products including Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are of great importance and hold significance in several industrial sectors, mainly food industry. Recent developments have come up with methodologies for the prevention of health complications like lack of adequate nutrition in our diet. This review delves deeper into the details of the food supplementation techniques and how CNTs function in this regard. This review includes the challenges in using CNTs for food applications and their future prospects in the industry. Food shortage has become a global issue and limiting food resources put an additional burden on the farmers for growing crops. Apart from quantity, quality should also be taken into consideration and new ways should be developed for increasing nutritional value of food items. Food supplementation has several complications due to the biologically active compounds and reaction in the in vivo environment, CNTs can play a crucial role in countering this problem through the supplementation of food by various processes including; nanoencapsulation and nanobiofortification thus stimulating crop growth and seed germination rates. CNTs also hold a key position in biosensing and diagnostic application for either the quality control of the food supplements or the detection of contagions like toxins, chemicals, dyes, pesticides, pathogens, additives, and preservatives. Detection such pathogens can help in attaining global food security goal and better production and provision of food resources. The data used in the current review was collected up to date as of March 31, 2024 and contains the best of our knowledge. Data collection was performed from various reliable and authentic literatures comprising PubMed database, Springer Link, Scopus, Wiley Online, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar.

Five species of Botryosphaeriaceae (Diplodia seriata, Dothiorella omnivora, Neofusicoccum macroclavatum, N. parvum, and Spencermartinsia viticola) were recovered from the Australian walnut orchards in a previous study, with D. seriata and N. parvum being the most prevalent. The present study evaluated inhibitory effects of ten fungicides on mycelium growth of those five species and on conidium germination of D. seriata and N. parvum. It investigated the preventative and curative efficacy of selected fungicides on disease incidence in glasshouse and field trials. In vitro experiments showed that nine of the fungicides reduced mycelium growth, and all ten inhibited conidium germination, but to varying extents. Tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride, fluazinam, fludioxonil and pyraclostrobin were the most effective for inhibiting mycelium growth (EC50 < 0.14 <mu>g a.i. mL(-1)), whereas pyraclostrobin, fluxapyroxad, fluopyram, penthiopyrad and tebuconazole were the most effective for inhibiting conidium germination (EC50 < 2.2 <mu>g a.i. mL(-1)). In planta experiments with five fungicides confirmed that preventative treatments had greater efficacy than curative treatments. A field trial with four commercial fungicide formulations demonstrated that tebuconazole and tebuconazole + fluopyram provided protection of walnut trees for the longest period. The field trial also confirmed the efficacy of pyraclostrobin and the inhibitory effect of fluazinam.

There is evidence that some secondgeneration insecticide-treated nets, which combine insecticide formulations with different modes of action, are protective against malaria while the nets are new; however, evidence for their impact over 3 years is scarce. In this study, we report the third-year results of a cluster-randomised controlled trial assessing the long-term effectiveness of dual-active ingredient long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Methods This is a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomised controlled trial, carried out between May 23, 2019, and April 30, 2023, in southern Benin. Restricted randomisation was used to assign 60 clusters (villages or groups of villages with a minimum of 100 households) to the three study groups (1:1:1) to evaluate the efficacy of pyriproxyfenpyrethroid LLINs and chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLINs compared with pyrethroid-only LLINs (reference) against malaria transmission. The study staff and communities were masked to the group allocation. The primary outcome was malaria incidence measured over the third year after LLIN distribution, in a cohort of children aged 6 months to 9 years at the time of enrolment, in the intention-to-treat population. Here, we present the data of the third year postLLIN distribution. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03931473. Findings Study net use declined over the 3 years and was consistently lowest in the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group (at 36 months: 889 [39<middle dot>4%] of 2257 participants vs 1278 [52<middle dot>2%] of 2450 participants for the chlorfenapyrpyrethroid LLIN group and 1400 [57<middle dot>6%] of 2430 participants for the pyrethroid-only LLIN group). The cohort of children for the third year of follow-up (600 per group) were enrolled between April 9 and 30, 2022. Mean malaria incidence during the third year after distribution was 1<middle dot>19 cases per child-year (95% CI 1<middle dot>09-1<middle dot>29) in the pyrethroidonly LLIN reference group, 1<middle dot>21 cases per child-year (1<middle dot>12-1<middle dot>31) in the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group (hazard ratio [HR] 1<middle dot>02, 95% CI 0<middle dot>71-1<middle dot>44; p=0<middle dot>92), and 0<middle dot>96 cases per child-year (0<middle dot>88-1<middle dot>05) in the chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLIN group (HR 0<middle dot>80, 0<middle dot>56-1<middle dot>17; p=0<middle dot>25). No adverse events related to study nets were reported by participants. Interpretation During the third year, as was also observed during the first 2 years, the pyriproxyfen-pyrethroid LLIN group did not have superior protection against malaria cases compared with the standard LLIN group. In the third year, people living in the chlorfenapyr-pyrethroid LLIN group no longer benefited from greater protection against malaria cases and infections than those living in the pyrethroid-only LLIN group. This was probably influenced by lower study net use than previous years and the declining concentration of partner insecticides in the nets.",NA,845

Even less-explored are the effects of commercial insecticides formulated with more than one active product. Short- and long-term lethal and sublethal effects were studied for the first time on the progeny of commercial formulations of spirotetramat, imidacloprid and a commercial mixture of these active ingredients on pupae of Diaeretiella rapae (M'ntosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), an endoparasitoid of aphids considered to be a potential biological control agent. Insecticides were exposed topically on aphid mummies in which the parasitoid was in the pupal stage. RESULTSImidacloprid reduced adult emergence by more than 30% and prolonged intra-host development time with respect to control from half the maximum recommended field dose (MFRD). Spirotetramat and commercial mixture only showed significant effects on these endpoints at doses above the MFRD. The tested formulations did not affect adult longevity, sex ratio, and percentage of parasitism in the exposed generation. At low concentrations the active ingredients in the commercial mixture behave synergistically, whereas at medium and high concentrations they behave antagonistically. Considering the 10% lethal dose (LD10), imidacloprid showed the highest hazard coefficient, whereas the commercial mixture was more hazardous when considering the LD50 and LD90. The commercial mixture and imidacloprid induced higher adult emergence and altered the sex ratio in the progeny. CONCLUSIONSThe following order of toxicity on D. rapae can be established: imidacloprid > commercial mixture > spirotetramat. Joint use of this species with imidacloprid and commercial mixture should be avoided in integrated pest management programs. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,847

During mating, this interference may alter the criteria deployed to assess potential mates as males and females find they must shift their focus and emphasize alternative sensory modalities. The wolf spider, Tigrosa helluo (Araneae, Lycosidae) is common in agricultural fields where commercial formulations of herbicides with glyphosate as the active ingredient are regularly applied. With the development of genetically resistant crops, glyphosate-based herbicides have become among the most widely used and heavily applied agricultural chemicals in the world. In a laboratory experiment, we explored the effects of this herbicide on male-female interactions during courtship, mating, and sexual cannibalism. We expected that it might impact assessment such that there was a shift in the features that were important to the outcome of mating interactions. When herbicide was present, female body condition, an indication of recent feeding success, became important to mating success. This result was, in part, due to higher rates of sexual cannibalism in parings of males and females with low body condition values. The leg raises and pedipalp waves that males perform in courtship were not affected by herbicide nor were they related to mating success but, across all treatments, they were negatively correlated with lytic activity of females as measured just prior to pairing. This result indicates that males detected this aspect of the female's physiology and that a strong immune response made the female less attractive, possibly because it indicated a current or recent infection. Taken together, these results verify that a common herbicide shifts mating criteria used by an agribiont spider and, separate from the herbicide, the immune status of females affects the reactions of courting males. The presence of herbicide increased the importance of body condition on mating success in the wolf spider. Females in good condition were more likely to mate and those in poor condition engaged in sexual cannibalism. Courtship behavior was not predictive of mating success but it was negatively correlated with female immunity.image",NA,848

To mitigate the invasion of indoor insect pests, behavioral modifications using spatial repellents containing natural products are emerging as alternatives to chemical insecticides especially around the kitchens and food storage areas. However, the absence of standardized testing methods for spatial repellency has undermined the reliability of these products. We introduced three distinct laboratory-scale repellency assays and their relevancy to simulated-use conditions. Out of eleven commercial products tested, five showed effectiveness in laboratory assays, and three of these were further proven effective in simulated-use tests as well. Another issue limiting the utility of commercially available spatial repellents was the lack of clear and comprehensive use instructions on product labels, potentially leading to ineffective applications. We observed that increasing the applied quantity improved the efficacy of one product that was initially determined to be ineffective in a simulated-use test. Based on our findings, we propose three strategies for regulations of spatial repellents: 1) consideration of mixture effects beyond single active ingredients especially using the natural products as their active ingredients, 2) the use of multiple testing systems, while acknowledging the limitations of laboratory assays in predicting real-world efficacy, and 3) ensuring product labels provide detailed and clear instructions for effective use.",NA,850

Traditional nematicides and other nematode control methods are being used against PPNs. However, stakeholders are searching for more sustainable and effective alternatives with limited side effects on the environment and mankind to face increased food demand, unfavorable climate change, and using unhealthy nematicides. This review focuses on upgrading the pre-procedures of PPN control as well as novel measures for their effective and durable management strategies on economically important crops. Sound and effective sampling, extraction, identification, and counting methods of PPNs and their related microorganisms, in addition to perfecting designation of nematode-host susceptibility/resistance, form the bases for these strategies. Therefore, their related frontiers should be expanded to synthesize innovative integrated solutions for these strategies. The latter involve supplanting unsafe nematicides with a new generation of safe and reliable chemical nematicidal and bionematicidal alternatives. For better efficacy, nematicidal materials and techniques should be further developed via computer-aided nematicide design. Bioinformatics devices can reinforce the potential of safe and effective biocontrol agents (BCAs) and their active components. They can delineate the interactions of bionematicides with their targeted PPN species and tackle complex diseases. Also, the functional plan of nematicides based on a blueprint of the intended goals should be further explored. Such goals can currently engage succinate dehydrogenase, acetylcholinesterase, and chitin deacetylase. Nonetheless, other biochemical compounds as novel targets for nematicides should be earnestly sought. Commonly used nematicides should be further tested for synergistic or additive function and be optimized via novel sequential, dual-purpose, and co-application of agricultural inputs, especially in integrated pest management schemes. Future directions and research priorities should address this novelty. Meanwhile, emerging bioactivated nematicides that offer reliability and nematode selectivity should be advanced for their favorable large-scale synthesis. Recent technological means should intervene to prevail over nematicide-related limitations. Nanoencapsulation can challenge production costs, effectiveness, and manufacturing defects of some nematicides. Recent progress in studying molecular plant-nematode interaction mechanisms can be further exploited for novel PPN control given related topics such as interfering RNA techniques, RNA-Seq in BCA development, and targeted genome editing. A few recent materials/techniques for control of PPNs in durable agroecosystems via decision support tools and decision support systems are addressed.

Thus, different acaricides have been applied as a strategy to control this disease. In the context of Integrated Pest Management, acaricides based on natural compounds, such as organic acids and essentials oils, are chosen by beekeepers to minimize negative effects on colonies and hive products. Considering the variety of natural active ingredients reported to have varroacidal activity and their different application systems, the aim of this work was to synthesize and quantify scientific knowledge on the acaricide performance of natural compounds to control V. destructor populations in Apis mellifera colonies. A systematic revision and a meta-analysis on the percentage of efficacy published for these formulations were conducted by selecting articles published between 2002 and 2022. According to our results, most publications investigated the efficacy of natural compounds in temperate climates and in European honey bee colonies since Varroa control is practically compulsory under these conditions. Thymol (THY) showed higher estimated efficacy compared to oxalic and formic acids (FA) and other essential oils (EOs). Variable efficacies were found in colonies treated with the natural compounds considered in this study according to different doses and application methods. The high between-study heterogeneity found in this revision might be explained by several factors, including the number of colonies and intra-apiary variation. As such, standardized protocols for field assays are key to improving efficacy evaluation. In addition, methodological implications are discussed.",NA,856

Non-dietary risk assessments involve estimating the amount of residue which can be transferred from plant foliage to the skin or clothes, known as dislodgeable foliar residues (DFRs). DFR data are less available than crop residue data as studies are costly and limited by seasonality. European regulatory authorities are reticent to allow extrapolation of study data to different scenarios as the contributory factors have hitherto been poorly identified. This study is the first to use a new laboratory DFR method to investigate how one such factor, pesticide formulation, may affect DFR on a variety of crops. The study used the active substance difenoconazole as both an emulsifiable concentrate (EC 10%) and a wettable powder (WP 10%) with and without adjuvants (Tween 20 and organophosphate tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate TEHP) on tomato, French bean and oilseed rape. A comparable DFR% was retained from the WP and EC formulation on most crops except for tomato, where lower DFR% was retained in the case of WP (39 +/- 4.7%) compared to EC (60 +/- 1.2%). No significant effect of adjuvant addition was observed for either formulation except when mixing TEHP (0.1% w/v) to the EC 10% on French bean, resulting in 8% DFR reduction compared to the EC formulation alone. This research demonstrates the value of a unique DFR laboratory technique in investigating the importance of the formulation and in-tank adjuvants as factors that affect DFR.",NA,857

Nevertheless, there is a limited number of studies that address the actual toxic effects of herbicides on insects. This study investigated the side effects of herbicides on non-target organisms inhabiting agroecosystems and performing essential ecological and economic functions such as crop pollination. We analysed morphological alterations in the gut, Malpighian tubules and circulating haemocytes of Apis mellifera workers as markers of exposure effects. A commercial formulation of a pendimethalin-based herbicide (PND) was administered orally under laboratory conditions at a realistic concentration admitted in the field (330gL-1 of active ingredient., 4 L ha-1 for cereal and vegetable crops). The worker bees were exposed to a single application of PND for a period of one week, to simulate the exposure that can occur when foraging bees accidentally drink drops of contaminated water upon treatments. Histopathological analyses of the midgut, ileum and Malpighian tubules showed alterations over time (from 24 to 72 h after the beginning of exposure) such as loss of epithelial organisation, cellular vacuolisation and altered pyknotic nuclei as well as disruption of the peritrophic membrane over time. Semiquantitative analyses of the midgut showed a significant increase in the organ injury index 24 and 72 h after the initial exposure in PND-exposed bees compared to control bees. In addition, a change in positivity to Gram staining was observed in the midgut histological sections. A recovery of cytotoxic effects was observed one week after the initial exposure, which was favoured by the periodic renewal of the intestinal epithelium and the herbicide dissipation time. Cytochemical staining with Giemsa of haemocytes from PND-treated workers over 24 and 72 h showed significant nuclear alterations such as lobed or polymorphic nuclei and micronuclei compared to bees in the control group. These results show that the dose of PND used to protect crops from weeds can lead to significant cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in non-target organisms such as honey bees. In croplands, the sublethal effects on cell morphology can impair vital physiological processes such as nutrition, osmoregulation, and resistance to pathogens, contributing to the decline in biodiversity and abundance of species that play a prominent ecological role, such as pollinators.",NA,859

The LC50 value of L.sphaericus was found to be 9.92% of 1 OD (optical density at 600 nm) culture after 24 h of treatment against grubs at in-vitro conditions. L.sphaericus cultures were formulated as liquid, solid, and capsule formulations, and analysed parameters such as viability, shelf life, and pest control efficiency against banana pseudostem weevils. The capsule-based formulation (8 +/- 2 x 10(2a) CFU/ml) was most effective against the grubs with a storage period of 120 days to six months under room temperature in air-free containers. The efficacy of a capsule-based formulation at in vivo conditions in the pseudostem revealed that the gelatine coat of the capsule disintegrated within 24hrs after application, leading to the easy release of active ingredients to the pseudostem.

Currently, herbicides are primarily applied for weed management. However, the effectiveness of herbicide deposition and uptake on barnyardgrass is limited as a consequence of the high wax content on leaves, low water solubility and extreme lipophilicity of herbicides. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel formulations for efficient delivery of herbicides to improve herbicidal activity and reduce dosage.RESULTSWe successfully prepared nanosuspension(s) (NS) of quinclorac through the wet media milling technique. This NS demonstrates excellent physical stability and maintains nanoscale during dose transfer. The deposition concentration and uptake concentration of NS on barnyardgrass were 3.84-4.47- and 2.11-2.58-fold greater than those traditional formulations, respectively. Moreover, the NS exhibited enhanced herbicidal activity against barnyardgrass at half the dosage required by conventional formulations without compromising rice safety.CONCLUSIONSThese findings suggest that NS can effectively facilitate the delivery of hydrophobic and poorly water-soluble herbicide active ingredients, thereby enhancing their deposition, uptake and bioactivity. This study expands the potential application of NS in pesticide delivery, which can provide valuable support for optimizing pesticide utilization, improving economic efficiency and mitigating environmental risks.

While regulatory risk assessments primarily focus on the active ingredients, recent research indicates ecotoxicological impacts of commercial preparations on non-target organisms, particularly within the soil ecosystem where key species such as earthworms play a vital role in maintaining soil quality and fertility. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the long-term effects of the following respective commercial preparations: the insecticides Sumialfa (esfenvalerate) and Calypso (thiacloprid), as well as the herbicides Frontier (dimethenamid-p) and Filon (prosulfocarb) on the earthworm Eisenia andrei in standardized soil during long-term exposures of 7, 14, and 28 days. To study the possible effects on different levels of biological organization, enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES) glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx); non-enzymatic biomarkers: multixenobiotic resistance activity (MXR), levels of glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as reproductive success were investigated. While Calypso appeared to be the least toxic substance, all pesticides showed significant effect on multiobiomarker response in E. fetida. That being said, the response of MXR activity was significantly altered by all tested pesticides indicating MXR being the most sensitive endpoint of the present research. Recovery of MXR was observed after 28 days, however, only in case of exposure to Filon, while the recovery of CAT activity was recorded after 28 days as well, subsequent to Sumialfa exposure. Reproductive success was negatively impacted regarding the Frontier and Sumialfa exposure at the highest concentration (100 mg/kg) reflected in reduced number of cocoons, while only the exposure to Frontier (100 mg/kg) reduced the number of juveniles. Based on the results, it is important to include commercial pesticide formulations in pesticide risk assessments.

Many adjuvants which modify the emulsion or extensional viscosity of the tank-mixture have been found to offer benefits in drift management, primarily by eliminating or reducing the 'Fine' droplets included in the spray with diameters <100-200 mu m that can move off-target in unfavorable conditions during ground, airblast and aerial pesticide applications. Among wind tunnel and field studies conducted around the world, there is consensus that while some adjuvants are effective for drift management, the performance varies on a case-by-case basis, requiring verification for each adjuvant which could be achieved through a programme such as certification based on showing a reduction in Fine droplets and/or a reduction in airborne drift. These can be measured in wind tunnel studies according to international standards. This article provides a review of the current science in this subject area, from the approaches to data collection to a review of existing data and regulatory application for encouraging and rewarding the use of appropriate adjuvants that have been demonstrated to reduce airborne spray drift potential and therefore the size of no-spray buffer zones appropriate to protect nontarget sensitive areas from drift exposure. Some adjuvants can offer the same reduction in drift as offered by hooded sprayer retrofits. A drift reduction programme based on adjuvant use could include testing candidate adjuvants for their effect on droplet size and reduction in Fine droplets when sprayed through reference nozzles and compared against sprays without the adjuvant. Testing could also be based alternatively on measurements of drift potential on collectors such as monofilament line in wind tunnel or field studies. Once shown to be effective in reducing 'Fines' or spray drift, adjuvants could be certified and then referenced on pesticide labels and/or regulatory or best management practice schemes to encourage their use and offer reductions in use restrictions or no-spray buffer zone sizes based on drift management. Studies have shown that some adjuvants can reduce pesticide leaching into soils and contamination of groundwater, as well as runoff of active ingredients from plants into the environment. Performance depends on the adjuvant type, the pesticide with which it is used, the soil or plant type, the timing and mass of water input from rainfall and climatic factors. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Acetamiprid, an approved neonicotinoid pesticide in the EU, may exert sub-lethal effects on pollinators and other organisms. However, our knowledge on the scope and severity of such effects is still incomplete. Our experiments focused on the effects of the insecticide formulation Mospilan (active ingredient: 20% acetamiprid) on the peripheral olfactory detection of a synthetic floral blend and foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers. We found that the applied treatment did not affect the antennal detection of the floral blend; however, it induced alterations in their foraging behaviour. Pesticide-treated individuals started foraging later, and the probability of finding the floral blend was lower than that of the control bumblebees. However, exposed bumblebees found the scent source faster than the controls. These results suggest that acetamiprid-containing Mospilan may disrupt the activity and orientation of foraging bumblebees.

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS : We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION : We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and ""inert"" ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of ""inert"" ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States.",NA,871

Our work aimed to evaluate the acute (survival) and chronic (regeneration, locomotion, and reproduction) toxicity of chlorpyrifos to the non-target freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina. The 48 h lethal concentration (LC50) of the commercial formulation, containing 480 g L-1 of chlorpyrifos, the active ingredient, was determined to be 622.8 mu g a.i. L-1 for planarians. Sublethal effects were translated into a significant reduction in locomotion and delayed head regeneration (lowest observed effect concentration-LOEC = 3.88 mu g a.i. L-1). Additionally, chlorpyrifos exposure did not affect planarian fecundity or fertility. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of chlorpyrifos-based insecticides to harm natural populations of freshwater planarians at environmentally relevant concentrations. The observed toxicity emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and careful management of chlorpyrifos usage to mitigate its deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems. By understanding the specific impacts on non-target organisms like G. tigrina, we can make more informed suggestions regarding the usage and regulation of organophosphate insecticides, ultimately promoting sustainable agricultural practices and environmental conservation.",NA,872

Here we investigated the combined effects of temperature on the lethal and sublethal responses of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae after exposure to commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam) and a pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin) and their mixture. Firstly, the concentration-response curves of the insecticides were determined under four temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) by the leaf dipping method. Subsequently, the sublethal concentrations C-0, CL1, CL5, CL10, CL15, CL20, and CL30 were selected to assess sublethal effects on aphids' longevity and reproduction under the same temperatures. The results showed that the mixture of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin caused greater toxicity to aphids compared to the formulations with each active ingredient alone and that the toxicity was higher at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the exposure to low concentrations of the mixture (thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin) and the separated insecticides induced stimulatory responses in the longevity and fecundity of exposed aphid females, but the occurrence of such hormetic responses depended on the insecticide type, its sublethal concentration, and the temperature as well as their interactions.",NA,877

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of chitosan coating of PCL+ATZ NCs on herbicidal activity and interaction mechanisms with Bidens pilosa plants. Chitosan-coated NCs (PCL/CS+ATZ) were synthesized and characterized for size, zeta potential, polydispersity, and encapsulation efficiency. Herbicidal efficiency was assessed in postemergence greenhouse trials, comparing the effects of PCL/CS+ATZ NCs (coated), PCL+ATZ NCs (uncoated), and conventional atrazine (ATZ) on photosystem II (PSII) activity and weed control. Using a hydroponic system, we evaluated the root absorption and shoot translocation of fluorescently labeled NCs. PCL/CS+ATZ presented a positive zeta potential (25 mV), a size of 200 nm, and an efficiency of atrazine encapsulation higher than 90%. The postemergent herbicidal activity assay showed an efficiency gain of PSII activity inhibition of up to 58% compared to ATZ and PCL+ATZ at 96 h postapplication. The evaluation of weed control 14 days after application ratified the positive effect of chitosan coating on herbicidal activity, as the application of PCL/CS+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha(-1) resulted in better control than ATZ at 2000 g of a.i. ha(-1) and PCL+ATZ at 1000 g of a.i. ha(-1). In the hydroponic experiment, chitosan-coated NCs labeled with a fluorescent probe accumulated in the root cortex, with a small quantity reaching the vascular cylinder and leaves up to 72 h after exposure. This behavior resulted in lower leaf atrazine levels and PSII inhibition than ATZ. In summary, chitosan coating of nanoatrazine improved the herbicidal activity against B. pilosa plants when applied to the leaves but negatively affected the root-to-shoot translocation of the herbicide. This study opens avenues for further investigations to improve and modify established nanosystems, paving the way for developing novel biological activity patterns.",NA,879

The efficacy of 8 foliar insecticide formulations for managing T. picirostris adult and larval life stages was determined in small and large-plot field trials across 2 crop years. In both years, bifenthrin (Brigade 2EC), the grower's standard, showed negligible adult and larval suppression. Insecticide formulations with isocycloseram and cyantraniliprole active ingredients reduced adult and larval populations when applied at BBCH 59-60 (prebloom) and BBCH 65-66 (full bloom) growth stages, respectively. While differences in T. picirostris abundance were observed among insecticide treatments, seed yield differences were not detected in large-plot trials. Larval abundance was correlated with reduced seed yield, and an economic threshold of >= 3 larvae per 30 inflorescences was determined as a conservative larval threshold to justify foliar applications of diamide insecticides. Additional commercial white clover seed fields were surveyed to compare larval scouting techniques, including a standard Berlese funnel and a grower's do-it-yourself funnel. Both larval extraction techniques were correlated and provided similar estimates of larval abundance.

RESULTSLethal concentrations (LCs) were lower for deltamethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin (LC10 = 0.000233, 0.000211, and 0.000271 mg active ingredient (a.i.) cm(-2), LC30 = 0.000413, 0.000398, and 0.000447 mg a.i. cm(-2), respectively), followed by etofenprox, and the mixture of acetamiprid with d-tetramethrin and piperonyl butoxide (LC10 = 0.00228 and 0.003267 mg a.i. cm(-2), LC30 = 0.00437 and 0.01188 mg a.i. cm(-2), respectively). Deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin negatively impacted adult walking behavior, increasing stop durations compared to controls. Adults exposed to LC10 and LC30 of lambda-cyhalothrin, and LC30 of deltamethrin exhibited prolonged periods on their backs compared to the remaining treatments and the controls. The alpha-cypermethrin LC30-exposed adults exhibited significantly shorter walking and stopping durations than controls but demonstrated prolonged climbing on the arena walls compared to adults exposed to the remaining a.i. and the control.

So in recent decades, biopesticides have gained traction in the pest management industry and have long been touted as potential substitutes for synthetic pesticides. Numerous characteristics of biopesticides, such as their host specificity, low levels of toxic residues, lack of phytotoxicity, and safety for humans, make them excellent choices for environmentally friendly agriculture. However, they find it challenging to compete with synthetic compounds in the marketplace due to their solubility, photolysis, relative instability, and greater price. To make biopesticides as effective as synthetic chemical pesticides, it is now essential to develop sophisticated biopesticide formulations. Recently, the creation of new nanomaterials has opened up new possibilities for creating innovative biopesticide formulations and enhancing their effectiveness in semi-field or laboratory settings. Most of the nanocomposites being researched for nano-biopesticides are designed to enhance formulation qualities such as permeability, controlled release, thermal and photostability, and crystallinity. Nanobiopesticides can be produced by loading active ingredients of biopesticides into nanocarriers through encapsulation, absorption, attachment, or entrapment. The various kinds of nanocarriers, including metal, metal oxides, non-metal oxides, polymers, carbon, lipids, etc., are employed in biopesticide formulations and create nanobiopesticides. In this connection, this review covers various aspects related to nanocarriers for nano-biopesticide formulations, such as preparation techniques and their value in controlling pests.",NA,885

Therefore, the extracts of invasive silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium Cav.) weeds using their berries parts (seeds, peels and mucilage) supported by bioassay-guided fractionation were tested against both the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) and Erwinia carotovora pv. carotovora causes of the blackleg of potatoes. The seeds and peels of S. elaeagnifolium were successively extracted by maceration using dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and ethanol (EtOH), respectively. While, its mucilage was extracted using EtOAc. The successive EtOH extract of the plant seeds had promising inhibition efficacy and the best minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 50 mu g/ml against E. Carotovora amongst other extracts (DCM and EtOAc of the plant berries parts). Depending on dose response activity, EtOH extract had G. mellonella larval mortality and pupal duration rates (LC50; 198.30 and LC95; 1294.73 mu g/ml), respectively. Additionally, this EtOH extract of seeds was fractionated using preparative TLC to three characteristic bands. The insecticidal and bacterial activities of these isolated bands (SEA, SEB, and SEC) were evaluated at a dose of 100 mu g/ml, causing mortality by 48.48, 62.63 and 92.93% (G. mellonella larvae) and inhibition by 15.22, 0.00 and 31.66 mm (E. carotovora), respectively. Moreover, the separated major three bands were tentatively identified using LC-ESI-MS analysis revealing the presence of two phenolic acids; chlorogenic acid (SEA) and dicaffeoyl quinic acid (SEB) in addition to one steroidal saponin (SEC) annotated as borassoside E or yamoscin. Finally, the plant seeds' successive EtOH extract as well as its active constituents, exhibited potential broad-spectrum activity and the ability to participate in future pest management initiatives.

To this end, natural plant essential oils and their active ingredients are commonly employed as eco-friendly preservatives. However, in many cases, these substances require different formulations or materials to enhance their physicochemical properties. A promising approach to address this issue is the utilization of cocrystallization technology, which is emerging as a valuable tool for developing innovative agrochemicals. By forming self-assembled cocrystals comprising essential oil components, various benefits can be achieved, such as enhanced thermal stability, controlled release of volatiles, improved persistence during food storage, and ultimately, the extension of food shelf life. Scope and approach: This mini-review discusses the recent progress in food preservation research using essential oil cocrystals in terms of the design and synthesis, structural characterization, physicochemical properties, and application effects of essential oil cocrystals. Based on the reports of cocrystallization of essential oil components, it highlights the advantages, shortcomings, and future exploration trends of this technology according to the current research status and practical needs in the field. Key findings and conclusion: The cocrystallization of essential oil components presents novel opportunities for applied research involving these active ingredients. By creating cocrystals with controlled-release properties, a promising avenue emerges for utilizing them as an innovative resource in the food industry. This approach has the potential to contribute to the creation of novel food preservatives and innovative active packaging.

Evaluation of dry neonicotinoid residues on treated filter paper is a commonly used method to determine the toxicity of active ingredients towards target and non-target organisms. Dry residues of four neonicotinoids, acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, on filter paper did not cause significant levels of mortality in Hippodamia convergens (Guerin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) when compared to paired untreated groups. Conversely, nearly 100% mortality was observed when test insects were exposed to dry neonicotinoid residues on leaf discs and glass plate surfaces. On the other hand, dry residues of the pyrethroid bifenthrin on filter paper, leaf disks, and glass plates killed significantly more test insects when compared to untreated groups. Additional bioassays tested the toxicity of acetamiprid and thiamethoxam by evaluating the toxicity of dry residues on (1) the upper and (2) lower surfaces of treated filter paper, (3) on a glass plate underneath treated filter paper, (4) on the upper surface of treated filter paper treated with insecticide and adjuvant, and (5) dried residues on a glass plate after dipping treated filter paper in water and letting the solvent dry on the inert test surface.

Due to its zoonotic transmission in Brazil, S. brasiliensis represents a significant health threat to humans and domestic animals. Itraconazole, terbinafine, and amphotericin B are the most used antifungals for treating sporotrichosis. However, many strains of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii have shown resistance to these agents, highlighting the importance of finding new therapeutic options.

Milteforan decreases S. brasiliensis fungal burden in A549 pulmonary cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages and also has an immunomodulatory effect by decreasing TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Our results suggest milteforan as a possible alternative to treat feline sporotrichosis. IMPORTANCE Sporotrichosis is an endemic disease in Latin America caused by different species of Sporothrix. This fungus can infect domestic animals, mainly cats and eventually dogs, as well as humans.

Control methods primarily rely on chemical pesticides, which pose environmental risks and potential hazards to human health. There is a need for sustainable management alternatives such as biologically-based slug control options. However, the efficacy of nonchemical measures for controlling pest slug populations remains limited, particularly in the context of variable outdoor conditions. Neuropeptides and their corresponding receptors have been proposed as promising biological targets for the development of new pest management strategies. RESULTSA total of 23 bioactive peptides belonging to the PRX family, previously identified from the grey garden slug, D. reticulatum, were injected into or fed to this species. The detrimental effects of these peptides, including a reduction in body weight and an inhibition of feeding activity, were evaluated in feeding choice tests with D. reticulatum. Furthermore, the bioactive peptide formulated with a lipid particle demonstrated a feeding deterrent effect. One of the myomodulin (MM) peptides, APPLPRY, demonstrated a significant reduction in feeding activity, resulting in a reduction in slug weight or mortality in just 30 min. CONCLUSIONThe results represent the first evidence of a bioactive peptide having detrimental effects on D. reticulatum including causing feeding deterrent for this slug pest.

Yet a limited number of insecticide classes are available for treating larval development sites for dipteran pest species. The most recently introduced class of insecticides in the United States (US) is the isoxazolines, including fluralaner. In the US, fluralaner is currently exclusively labeled for use against ectoparasites in companion animals. However, research has shown that it has a wider effective target range beyond ectoparasites and could be developed as an insecticide for vector control. Here we tested a novel, proprietary, yeast microencapsulated (YME) formulation of fluralaner against the larvae of three pest species: Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae), and Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). These species all naturally consume microorganisms as larvae, including yeasts. Fluralaner was successfully microencapsulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. YME fluralaner was reconstituted in water at concentrations of 0.00001-0.1 mg/ mL (Aedes and Culicoides) or 1-50 mg/mL (Musca) for use in dose-response assays. For each species, the LC50 at 24 h was estimated using probit analyses. YME fluralaner was highly effective against all species tested (Ae. albopictus LC50 = 0.000077 mg/mL; C. sonorensis LC50 = 0.00067 mg/mL; M. domestica LC50 = 2.58 mg/mL). Additionally, laboratory assays were conducted to determine product reapplication rates using LC50 rates. Reapplication rates to maintain <50 % emergence were five weeks (Ae. albopictus) and greater than eight weeks (C. sonorensis). The results presented here indicate YME fluralaner is a promising candidate for controlling larval insects that naturally feed on detritus, thereby bypassing cuticular penetration barriers and safely delivering the active ingredient to the target species.",NA,895

The current study assessed the bioefficacy of the new indoor residual spray formulation, VECTRONTM T500 against Klypson 500 WG and water against laboratory reared and wild populations of Anopheles gambiae s.l.. The comparative experimental hut trial was implemented between June 2022 and December 2022 to determine the efficacy of VECTRONTM T500, containing the active ingredient (ai) broflanilide as a 50 % wettable powder (WP). The efficacy of VECTRONTM T500 was compared with a positive control, Klypson 500 WG, a wettable granule (WG) formulation that contains 50 % clothianidin. Cement and mud walls were sprayed with VECTRONTM T500, Klypson 500 WG with water sprayed as a negative control. The two insecticides and negative control were evaluated monthly for six months against laboratory and the field-derived An. gambiae s.l. using the standard WHO cone bioassays. Each wall had two cones on each day of testing. VECTRONTM T500 was sprayed on both surface types at a rate of 100mg ai/m2 whilst Klypson 500 WG was applied at a rate of 300 mg ai/m2. For both wall surface types, the vector from the laboratory-reared and the wild populations exhibited a low knockdown effect to both VECTRONTM T500 and Klypson 500 WG. A total of 3,840 mosquitoes were used of which 2,880 (75 %) were susceptible colony of An. gambiae s.s. and 960 (25 %) were wild An. gambiae s.l.. The VECTRONTM T500 induced a mortality of 97.8 %-98.1 % in the laboratory population and 83.2-95.0 % wild population mosquitoes on cement and mud-walled huts respectively while Klypson 500 WG ranged from 89.6-99.0 % for wild and 99.0-99.3 % for the laboratory population mosquitoes on cement and mud walls respectively.

Glyphosate affected the spore production rate more rapidly and severely than diquat or mechanical defoliation. We hypothesize that this effect was related to disruption of the C metabolism in the whole plant combined with a possible direct effect of glyphosate on the fungus within the roots and/or perhaps in soil via the release of this active ingredient from decaying roots. No glyphosate could be detected in the roots due to technical constraints, while its release from the roots in the medium corresponded to 0.11% of the active ingredient applied to the leaves. The three defoliation practices strongly affected root colonization, compared to the non-defoliated plants. However, the amount of glyphosate released into the medium did not affect spore germination and germ tube growth. These results suggest that the effects of defoliation on the dynamics of spore production are mainly indirect via an impact on the plant, and that the effect is faster and more marked with the glyphosate-formulation, possibly via a direct effect on the fungus in the roots and more unlikely on spore germination.",NA,900

Argentina is one of the main producers and exporters of corn globally. Post-harvest pests, such as the insect Sitophilus zeamais, can cause losses of more than 10%, representing a very important negative economic impact on the industry. For pest control many synthetic insecticides are used. Nevertheless, these insecticides show toxicity to mammals and environmental contamination and cause resistance. For this, there is a constant need to introduce new substances used in the protection of crops and the plant extracts and their volatile products are an interesting alternative. In this work we evaluate the effectiveness of natural VACs for the control of S. zeamais and the prolonged effect of the more toxic alcohol incorporated in a paint on its survival. 1-heptyn-3-ol was the most toxic alcohol tested (LC50 = 0.74 mu L/L). In the presence of food, the fumigant toxicity of 1-heptyn-3-ol was lower (LC50 = 14.73 mu L/L). Also, the non-phytotoxic effect of 1-heptyn-3-ol was determined. When the 1-heptyn-3-ol was included in the polyvinyl paint, the toxic effect was prolongated in the time, causing even 80% mortality at 14th day. Regarding the repellent effect of 1-heptyn-3-ol, it was observed that this alcohol included in the bioactive paint, in the presence of food, presented a repellency similar to that determined for the pure compound, in the absence of food, and greater than the repellency determined for the pure compound in the presence of food.

Wheat is infested with different weeds that cause yield losses (up to 100%) that vary based on the type of weed, their density, and the environmental conditions.

Use of nanoherbicides is a promising strategy to cope with the issue of herbicide resistance. To achieve weed control conditions during the whole growing season, nanoformulations of herbicides are a delivery strategy that involves covering an active component with various materials that vary in size from nano to nanoscale and then releasing the substance in a controlled manner. Nanoherbicides prevent leaching and volatilization of active components and premature degradation through photolysis, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. According to studies, nanoencapsulation of herbicides produces more targeted and less hazardous agricultural formulations. Using nanoherbicides in lower concentrations is beneficial. It lessens the long-term impacts of herbicide residues in wheat fields and the toxicity of these herbicides to the environment. It is also beneficial in eliminating the weeds without ever interacting with the crop plants, which eventually results in a greater wheat yield. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of utilizing nanoparticles (NPs) in herbicides for effective weed management in wheat crops. This article explores the novel approach of integrating NPs with herbicidal agents, highlighting their potential benefits and challenges. The review also addresses the current state of research, recent advancements, and potential future directions in this evolving area of agricultural science.",NA,904

Managing the disease with fungicides can harm health and the environment and can lead to the selection of pathogens resistant to their active ingredients. The use of essential oils (EOs) represents an alternative control method due to their richness in antimicrobial compounds, such as rosemary EO (Rosmarinus officinalis). However, the high volatility of several components of these oils makes commercial use difficult, and nanoencapsulation presents a technology to increase stability. In the present study, three formulations containing rosemary EO-nanoemulsion (NE), nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), and nanocapsules with chitosan (NC)-were evaluated on strawberry fruits and against the fungus. The nanoformulations retained their characteristics (mean values: size 142 nm; polydispersity index 0.131; pH 4.99; zeta potential -20.2 mV for NE and NLC, and 19.1 mV for NC) when stored at 40 degrees C for 60 days. All nanoformulations had a direct effect on spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea, possibly due to damage caused to the cell wall and plasma membrane, and changes in the pathogen's oxidative balance. NE containing 2 % EO, when applied by immersion, reduced the incidence and severity of the disease by around 40 % and 70 %, respectively, 6 days after treatment. The fruits treated with this formulation maintained their physicochemical characteristics for longer. Thus, the use of rosemary oil from NE can be an option for managing gray mold and increasing the shelf life of the fruits.",NA,906

This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment. Regulatory agencies should consider reclassifying safeners as active ingredients to ensure adequate toxicity testing and risk assessment.",NA,907

A micellar solution of Poloxamer 407 was selected as a cosmetic base because of the good washing ability, easy application, and high tolerability of this polymeric surfactant. The solubilization capacity of a 5% micellar solution with respect to alpha-bisabolol was investigated by applying varying solubilization techniques and increasing concentrations of the oily active substance. The test samples were subjected to an accelerated physical stability test, viscosimetry, dynamic light scattering (DLS), electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), foamability test, and antimicrobial screening. Over the course of this research, the advantage of the film-hydration method over direct solubilization was demonstrated by the narrower size distribution and smaller hydrodynamic size of the micellar nano-carriers (ranging from 29.02 to 116.5 nm) and the respective higher physical stability of the dispersions. The optimized composition was found to be suitable for application on large skin areas in terms of viscosity in the temperature range from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C (3.4-2.3 mPa.s). Preservation of the washing capacity of the micellar solution in the presence of solubilized alpha-bisabolol was established. The active composition demonstrated inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and fungicidal activity against Candida albicans.

Notably, there is a lack of research examining both the efficacy and long-term effects of nanoemulsion treatments on rice quality, as most existing studies focus primarily on immediate harmful effects or repellent capabilities without considering prolonged impacts. This research is pioneering in exploring how nanoemulsion treatments influence the physical and chemical properties, nutritional value, and overall quality of paddy rice, as well as their effects on the rice weevil, (Sitophilus oryzae L., Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Nanoemulsions were prepared using a high-energy ultrasonication process and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, revealing spherical particles ranging from 27 to 34 nm in diameter. The formulations exhibited kinetic stability, slight acidity (pH 5.0-6.33), and favorable physicochemical properties including zeta potential (-31.6 to -15.2 mV), viscosity (27-34 cP), and surface tension (28.12-53.59 dyne/cm).

This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT (R) and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00-1.49 mg of the active ingredient & sdot;kg- 1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT (R) at >= 0.66 mg kg- 1 and SPIN at >= 0.13 mg kg- 1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT (R) at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg- 1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT (R) and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT (R) and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT (R) on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT (R) and SPIN.

This study focused on analyzing the formation of biofilms on granular activated carbon (GAC) with different particle sizes, BFilters (BF) with 12-25 mesh (named as C1 and C2), and Sigma-Aldrich (SA) with 12-20 mesh (named as C3 and C4), to configure a BAC unit. The performance of the BAC units was evaluated against the removal of pesticides and flame retardants, which are potentially hazardous contaminants. The formation of biofilms in the surface of the carbons were analyzed by metagenomic characterization, which showed a diversity of distinct species with a predominance of Lysinbacillus fusiforms (28.87 % for C2, 16.50 % for C3), Lysinibacillus sphaericus (11.54 % C2, 25.73 % C3), Bacillus cereus group (11.15 % C2, 18.82 % C3) and Enterobacteriaceae bacterium (92.75% C1, 87.42% C4). The images obtained by SEM showed that the surface of the GAC consists of irregularities and small pores, and that after the formation of the biofilm, an increase in the pores of the carbon can be visually observed, with uniform growth of microorganism colonies within these pores. BET analyses showed that for C1 and C2, after biofilm formation, there was a surface area increase of 43.7 % for C1 and 13 % for C2, along with an increase in micropore volume by 32 % and 10.6 %, respectively. This demonstrates that the larger particle size of these carbons was responsible for the formation of the biofilm. The BAC removal efficiency for target compounds such as pesticides and organophosphate flame retardants proved to be efficient, reaching in most of the cases around 99 % of removal at the used operational conditions. The biofilter from GAC BF (C1 and C2) showed greater diversity of microorganisms which were responsible for the higher modification in its surface structure.",NA,920

These results demonstrate that the HLDP-CS nano-protectant displays the best control effects on mango anthracnose via the direct pathogen inhibition and amplified plant immune responses. The HLDP can be spontaneously conjugated with CS into nanoscale spherical particles through hydrophobic interaction. The complexation of CS with HLDP remarkably improves the deposition and adhesion of CS droplets on mango leaves. The HLDP can interact with mycelium via electrostatic interaction to damage the cell wall/membrane, which can act as an AI to directly suppress the spore germination and mycelial growth. Meanwhile, HLDP can be applied as an adjuvant for CS to amplify the plant immune responses via accelerating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormones.

With desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (DESI MSI) using leaf imprints, we were able to visualize the active agrochemical mobility of a commercial fungicide formulation with the active ingredient Azoxystrobin in whole tomato leaves. The leaf-imprinting method was optimized with precise control over the pressure conditions and time of imprinting to yield highly consistent samples for imaging. The reproducibility of this method was tested with the Azoxystrobin formulation applied to tomato leaves and was compared to the mobility of the unformulated Azoxystrobin standard in similar application conditions. The xylem mobility and the lateral-leaf lamina spreading of the fungicide were visualized with mass spectrometry imaging and validated using complementary LC-MS studies. The necessity and importance of the agrochemical application as a formulation were re-iterated by the limited mobility observed in Azoxystrobin standard studies compared to the Azoxystrobin formulation.

The advancement in insecticidal paint technology has steered toward the development and evaluation of such formulations for use against arthropod vectors. The improved insecticidal paint formulations may contain two or more active agents, hence could display different type of activity against the target vectors. In the present study, optimum concentrations of deltamethrin (1%), chlorpyriphos (0.5%) and pyriproxyfen (0.075%) were used as active ingredients (AIs) to develop flame retardant slow-release insecticides paint (FRSRIP) formulation. The developed formulation was tested for physico-chemical properties, toxicity and efficacy against two important mosquito vectors. The formulation was glossy, smooth, uniform and scratch proof. Furthermore, the formulation was flame retardant and conformed to class-A according to the guidelines. Acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity suggested that the formulation is safe for use in human dwellings. The formulation was evaluated against Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi mosquitoes in laboratory upto four years. It was found that KDT50 after 24 months (T24) was 14.8 +/- 0.8 min and 17.1 +/- 1.0 min, while after 48 month (T48) was 21.3 +/- 2.0 min and 22.4 +/- 1.4 min in both Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi respectively. KDT50 was found varying during the different time intervals (T6 to T48) in both Ae. aegypti (p = 0.01) and An. stephensi (p = 0.0003). Furthermore the corrected mortality (CM) also found statistically declined during the period of evaluation (T6 to T48) in both the test species (F >= 42. 4; p <= 0.0001).

To achieve the SDG 2030 agenda goal 12- ""Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"" there is an urgent need to shift towards using toxic-free agricultural inputs. Various techniques are widely adopted to control weed growth and development, but farmers mostly rely on herbicide application. Nanotechnology-enabled herbicide formulations are more sustainable and efficient in weed control than traditional sources. The nanoherbicides enable lesser application frequency and minimum quantity requirement, thereby preventing herbicide accumulation in soil and water bodies. Mainly nano-mediated biodegradable carrier-based herbicides possess properties of prolonged release, targeted inhibition, reduced mobility in soil, better adhesion to the plant surface, and retards rapid degradation of active ingredients (AIs), which increase herbicide use efficiency against weeds. Biodegradable carrier materials are cost-effective and readily available from living/non-living organisms and mineral sources, which can be an alternate source for metal/metal-oxide carrier materials. Materials like chitosan, plant derivatives, clay particles, and synthetic polymers are notable carrier materials reported for encapsulating or loading herbicide molecules. Applying nano-mediated herbicides is an innovative methodology for controlling weeds while considering environmental safety.

It damages plants by secreting large amounts of oxalic acid and cell wall-degrading enzymes. To meet this challenge, we designed a new pH/enzyme dual-responsive nanopesticide Pro@ZnO@Pectin (PZP). This nanopesticide uses zinc oxide (ZnO) as a carrier of prochloraz (Pro) and is encapsulated with pectin. When encountering oxalic acid released by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the acidic environment promotes the decomposition of ZnO; at the same time, the pectinase produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can also decompose the outer pectin layer of PZP, thereby promoting the effective release of the active ingredient. Experimental data showed that PZP was able to achieve an efficient release rate of 57.25% and 68.46% when pectinase was added or under acidic conditions, respectively. In addition, in vitro tests showed that the antifungal effect of PZP was comparable to that of the commercial Pro (Pro SC) on the market, and its efficacy was 1.40 times and 1.32 times that of the Pro original drug (Pro TC), respectively. Crucially, the application of PZP significantly alleviated the detrimental impacts of Pro on wheat development. Soil wetting experiments have proved that PZP primarily remained in the soil, thereby decreasing its likelihood of contaminating water sources and reducing potential risks to non-target organisms. Moreover, PZP improved the foliar wettability of Pro, lowering the contact angle to 75.06 degrees. Residue analyses indicated that PZP did not elevate prochloraz residue levels in tomato fruits compared to conventional applications, indicating that the nanopesticide formulation does not lead to excessive pesticide buildup.

Previously, plant virus nanoparticles have been shown to penetrate soil and deliver agrochemicals for the treatment of plant parasitic nematodes. For example, tobacco mild green mosaic virus (TMGMV) can be functionalized with agrochemicals through bioconjugation, infusion at the coat protein interface, or encapsulation through thermal shapeshifting (rod-to-sphere). There continues to be a need to expand approaches for agrochemical display and delivery with a need for plug-and-play technology to be applicable for multiple nanoparticle platforms and agrochemicals. Toward this goal, we turned toward a bio-specific coupling strategy making use of the biotin-(strept)avidin system. Herein, we conjugated TMGMV with either avidin or biotin using azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The avidin/biotin-functionalized TMGMV nanoparticles were then characterized by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy to confirm cargo loading and the nanoparticle's structural integrity. Soil column assays confirmed that soil mobility was maintained upon chemical modification. Ivermectin modified with biotin or streptavidin linkers was then introduced to the TMGMV-avidin/biotin nanoparticles and binding propensity and loading were validated by QCM-D and a competitive ELISA. Finally, the ivermectin-loaded TMGMV nanoparticles were used to treat C. elegans in a gel burrowing assay, demonstrating that either pesticide loading strategy resulted in active TMGMV nanoparticle formulation that significantly reduced the mobility of nematodes, even after passing through soil. In stark contrast, free ivermectin only exhibited efficacy when applied directly to nematodes; the free pesticide was lost in the soil column-highlighting the need for a delivery system. The presented approach provides a facile plug-and-play approach for pesticide loading onto TMGMV nanoparticles. In particular, biotinylated TMGMV with streptavidin-conjugated ivermectin served as the most effective formulation. Importantly this method does not require heat, which contrasts our previous method of thermal reshaping that requires sample and pesticide exposure to temperatures > 96 degrees C. We envision the bio-specific loading strategy could be extended to other protein or inorganic nanoparticles to advance soil treatment strategies.",NA,931

Controlling dense conifer invasions is challenging and requires both effective initial control methods and long-term site management to prevent re-invasion. Broadcast aerial herbicide application is often the preferred treatment method for dense infestations of pines with high rates of complex herbicide mixtures used. The objective of this study was to: (i) test the efficacy of four simple herbicide mixes (containing two active ingredients and one adjuvant) as compared to an operational standard (four active ingredients and three adjuvants) for control of Pinus contorta invasions in a field trial and (ii) to quantify the effect of treatment mixes on non-target vegetation to determine impacts to plant community composition.RESULTSWe found that a simplified herbicide mix containing two active ingredients and one adjuvant was equally as effective as the current operational standard, with efficacy for all treatments increasing as a function of stem density. All herbicide treatments significantly impacted the post-spray community composition with differences among treatments in post-spray vegetation composition also detected. Following all treatments plant communities transitioned from a mixed native/exotic grassland-herb community to a simplified community dominated by exotic grasses.CONCLUSIONSOur results indicate a simpler herbicide mix could be used for broadcast aerial control of dense pine invasion reducing total herbicide input and cost of the operation. Post-spray vegetation community recovery could reflect the impact of the herbicides used in the operation compounded by soil biogeochemical processes already initiated through the pine invasion.

In line with this objective, we present green preparation of a colloidal pesticide formulation using optimized lysine-derived carbon dots (LysCDs)-modified CaCO3 (LysCDs/CaCO3) particles as the carrier and abamectin (Abm) as the active ingredient. The loading capacity of abamectin in this colloidal pesticide (LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm) is 1.7 to 2.1 times higher than that of its counterpart (CaCO3/Abm) prepared without LysCDs, which is attributed to the increased specific surface area and pore volume of LysCDs/CaCO3 particles. Due to the acid-induced degradation of CaCO3, the release of abamectin for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm is accelerated under weakly acidic conditions, which is accompanied by the release of Ca2+ ions and the fluorescence changes of LysCDs. The incorporation of LysCDs enhances the photostability and foliar adhesiveness of this colloidal pesticide, resulting in the highest degree of foliar retention when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or rainfall, compared to free-form abamectin and CaCO3/Abm. This results in the best performance of pest control on Plutella xylostella for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm in both indoor and outdoor tests. Nontarget biocompatibility evaluations show that LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm exhibits lower acute toxicity to zebrafish and earthworms than free-form abamectin. In addition, this colloidal pesticide is favored by the minimal residue of the adjuvant material after abamectin release, which is converted into harmless Ca2+ ions, CO2, and LysCDs. Therefore, this work designs a safer and more effective colloidal pesticide formulation to deliver abamectin with minimal adjuvant residue, realizing its trajectory as basically ""circular and green"".",NA,938

Control measures frequently rely on spraying contact insecticides, which often are inadequate. To provide insights for utilizing baits for their control, TCA foraging behavior was examined on liquid ant bait formulations that contained either fast-acting dinotefuran or slow-acting disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT), and the impacts of these baits were assessed. Bayesian modeling of counts from time-lapse photography of TCA feeding on the baits and a control of sucrose solution in the field revealed strong evidence of similar foraging intensities between the control and the DOT bait and less foraging intensity on the dinotefuran bait. TCA abundance on the dinotefuran bait peaked within 8 h, then diminished to smaller feeding bouts over the 3-day study. In contrast, foraging on the DOT and control remained consistently high before bait depletion. The impact of the fast and slow-acting baits in field plots were based on TCA nest sizes and TCA abundance on sausage lures. Bayesian modeling predictions revealed nest sizes declined over the 2 months with bait present while the control had large nests. Abundance on the lures in the dinotefuran plots declined from the start of the study, while with the slow-acting DOT bait, declines in abundance were not lower than the control plot until 30 days after baiting was initiated.

There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective new acaricidal agents. Essential oils and their volatile compounds are promising alternatives. Ensuring the use of optimal solvents or surfactants that do not compromise the acaricidal activity of these compounds during testing is crucial. This study aims to evaluate how compounds thymol, carvacrol and eugenol interact with xylol, methanol, ethanol, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, castor oil, propylene glycol, vaseline, and Tween 80 (R) to enhance (or to worse) their acaricidal efficacy against R. microplus. Larval mortality time were compared against one negative control (soybean oil) and two positive controls (commercial pour-on products). The experiments were conducted in 48-well polyethylene plates, with around 100 larvae immersed in 200 mu l of each solvent at 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.56% and diluted in soybean oil or water, according to solubility. Each volatile compound (Thymol, carvacrol and eugenol) was diluted in the tested solvents to assess larval mortality time. Xylol demonstrated the shortest larval mortality time, even at a minimum concentration (p < 0.05). In contrast, liquid vaseline exhibited the longest larval mortality time. When thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol were combined with xylol, they achieved the shortest larval mortality time. Conversely, when diluted in liquid vaseline they exhibited synergistic effects decreasing the mortality time. Tween 80 (R) worsen the efficacy of thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, resulting in prolonged larval mortality times.

Herbicides with a longer retention and slow-release nature could allow Striga seeds to germinate and be killed before attaching to the host. Therefore, a graphene oxide based nanoformulation loaded with atrazine was synthesized and evaluated under controlled and field conditions for its release kinetics, Striga control efficiency (SCE), and cane yield for two years (2018-2019) at two locations. In-vitro assays on release kinetics showed that the release rate of active ingredient (a.i.) from the nanocomposite loaded with atrazine (NCA) was slower (64.5%) than conventional atrazine (82.1%) on the 30th day in water. Similarly, cumulative release percentage of a.i. with NCA was 4.4% compared to atrazine (16.2%) at the initial 0-3 days in soil. Further, field evaluation (deep application in 12 cm furrows) of NCA at 1.25 kg a.i./ha at 95 days after planting (DAP) found superior in delaying Striga emergence by 18-20 days over atrazine. Furthermore, NCA recorded the highest efficacy (similar to 21%) across two locations owing to reduced Striga density (66.7-68.2%) and dry weight (39.3-48.9%). Consequently, NCA at 95 DAP produced higher cane (30.6-31.0%) and sugar (30.7-36.7%) yields. Therefore, carbon-based graphene oxide with a greater surface area and low production cost would offer an environmentally benign and alternative option in controlling Striga before its haustorium attaches to sugarcane roots.

The research aims to address the inherent challenges of essential oils, particularly their high volatility and rapid degradation, by improving their stability and insecticidal efficiency against the grain pest Sitophilus granarius. By anchoring EOCL onto clay matrices, this study seeks to achieve a sustained and controlled release of the active components, thereby enhancing their practical application as biopesticides. The clays were comprehensively characterized using advanced analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques revealed the mineralogical composition, thermal properties, and morphology of the clays, demonstrating their suitability for effectively adsorbing and retaining EOCL. The insecticidal performance of the clay/EOCL composites was thoroughly tested under controlled conditions, revealing a marked improvement in efficacy, with significantly lower lethal doses required to achieve high mortality rates in Sitophilus granarius. The diffusion of EOCL through the clay matrix was modeled using Fick's law of diffusion, and the results were further refined through statistical optimization to identify key parameters that influence the release and effectiveness of the active compounds. Complementing the experimental approach, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted to explore the molecular interactions between limonene, the primary active component of EOCL, and target proteins in insects. This theoretical investigation provided insights into the potential mechanisms of action, reinforcing the empirical findings. This study concludes that encapsulating EOCL within porous clay matrices not only enhances the stability and controlled release of the oil but also significantly boosts its insecticidal effectiveness.

The results showed that the active ingredient decreased by 18.15% after 14 weeks of storage at 54 degrees C. However, the decline within the same time period ranged between 510% at 35, 40, and 45 degrees C, respectively. Thus, hexythiazox storage complied with FAO specification after more than 14 weeks at 35 degrees C and not after more than 9, 8, and 4 weeks at 40, 45, and 54 degrees C, respectively. The data showed that the degradation rate of hexythiazox was dependent on its initial concentration and increased progressively as temperature increased. Furthermore, the shelf life of hexythiazox after storage at 54 degrees C was found to be approximately 1/5 that of its shelf life after storage at 35 degrees C. The kinetics of hexythiazox degradation under the studied conditions followed the first-order model, being dependent upon its initial concentration. The shelf life (t0.95) and half-life (t1/2) of hexythiazox in forced alkaline solutions were less than those in acidic solutions. The results revealed that hexythiazox is a non-persistent pesticide in soil; it decomposed rapidly in Egyptian clay-loam soil, with an 80.53% reduction in 14 days at ambient conditions and a half-life (t1/2) of 5.75 days. This is due to soil pH (8.59), organic matter (1.92), and the molecular structure of hexythiazox, which contains chromophores such as ethylene and carbonyl groups; it may be sensitive to direct photolysis by sunlight because it absorbs wavelengths longer than 290 nm. According to the GC/MS analysis, hexythiazox was degraded to different byproducts after specified conditions. The benzene and cyclohexane rings remain stable under different applied conditions; however, the thiazolidine ring is cleaved and opened during thermal and forced acidic hydrolysis and remains stable after alkaline hydrolysis and soil photolysis. The contraction reaction is unique to the forced alkaline hydrolysis and photolysis of hexythiazox in clay-loam soil; thus, two products were identified: 4-chloro-2(cyclohexanecarboxamido) benzoic acid and 3-cyclohexyl-1-methyl-1-(2-phenylethyl) urea; the latter one and 4-methyl-5-phenylthiazolidine-2-one were identified in the forced alkaline hydrolysis of hexythiazox.",NA,943

These attributes make it a highly valuable candidate for antifungal therapy and as an antibiotic adjuvant. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of BBR's antifungal properties, focusing on its in vitro and in vivo activity, underlying mechanisms, and its influence on fungal pathogenicity, including virulence, biofilm formation, and resistance. Additionally, the antifungal potential of BBR extracts, derivatives, and nanoformulations is examined in detail. BBR demonstrates fungicidal effects through multiple mechanisms. It targets critical fungal components such as mitochondria, cell membranes, and cell walls, while also inhibiting enzymatic activity and transcription processes. Furthermore, it suppresses the expression of virulence factors, effectively diminishing fungal pathogenicity. Beyond its direct antifungal activity, BBR exerts beneficial effects on the host by modulating gut microbiota, thereby bolstering host defenses against fungal infections and reducing potential adverse effects. BBR's interaction with conventional antifungal drugs presents a unique complexity, particularly in the context of resistance mechanisms. When used in combination therapies, conventional antifungal drugs enhance the intracellular accumulation of BBR, thereby amplifying its antifungal potency as the primary active agent. These synergistic effects position BBR as a promising candidate for combination strategies, especially in addressing drug-resistant fungal infections and persistent biofilms. As antifungal resistance and biofilm-associated infections continue to rise, the multifaceted properties of BBR and its advanced formulations highlight their significant therapeutic potential. However, the scarcity of robust in vivo and clinical studies limits a full understanding of its efficacy and safety profile. To bridge this gap, future investigations should prioritize well-designed in vivo and clinical trials to thoroughly evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of BBR in diverse clinical settings.

Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using two different detection methods, namely XZ depth mapping and XY area mapping, in conjunction with liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to investigate the penetration of various pesticide formulations over time. The SERS results showed that APEOs significantly increased the penetration depth of thiabendazole by 93.3 % in spinach and 21.4 % in apples, as well as enhanced the characteristic peak intensity by 73.52 % in spinach and 152.24 % in apples at the depth level of-60 mu m after 3-day exposure. LC-MS/MS confirmed the consistent increases in internal thiabendazole residues in both fresh produce models due to APEOs. However, APEOs did not affect the penetration of the non-systemic phosmet in either apple or spinach. The combination of these two SERS mapping methods can provide a comprehensive understanding of the penetration profiles of different systemic pesticide formulations at various sensoria.

(Diptera: Muscidae), are commonplace pests in both urban and agricultural settings. The potential for house flies as vectors of many disease-causing organisms to humans and animals, coupled with their incessant nuisance behaviors toward these hosts has resulted in a desire to manage their populations. Although many house fly management tools are available, insecticide use continues to predominate as the preferred choice. One such option, insecticidal baits, is commercially available in a variety of active ingredients that encompass several modes of action. Though they can be effective, resistance to many of the active ingredients used in bait formulations has been documented. The primary pathway for resistance evolution to bait products likely has been selection at the targeted adult stage. However, exposure at the larval stage may occur when these products are scattered on substrates, contaminating sub-surface developmental areas and ultimately, playing a selective role as well. A study was conducted to assess the potential mortality effects of insecticidal bait products on house fly larval development when applied according to the manufacturer's recommended label rate. Adult house fly emergence was reduced by nearly 40% due to treatment, supporting the implication that bait-driven mortality during larval development may represent a previously unrecognized selection pathway contributing to resistance evolution against these products.",NA,946

The goal of this study was to compare aerial application and chemigation under simulated conditions to determine the most effective insecticide application method for managing S. albicosta. Three larval stages were exposed to the highest and lowest label rates of commercial formulations of bifenthrin (36.8 and 112.1 g a.i. ha-1) and chlorantraniliprole (52.7 and 75.1 g a.i. ha-1).

The best eco-friendly methods to combat these jute pests involve administration of nano-biopesticides, as a successful alternative to the toxic chemicals. In this study, a nano-biopesticide formulation containing green synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using Ocimum sanctum leaf extract has been proposed. The characterization studies confirmed significant interactions between the Ag NPs and bioactive components in the nano-biopesticide formulation. The comparative analysis of the aforementioned larval mortality showed better responses in the nano-biopesticide formulation rather than the crude (pure) leaf extract. The LC50 values were calculated both for the nano-biopesticide formulation and pure extract after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment. The nano-biopesticide formulation was found to exhibit the lowest and much promising LC50 value of 93.21 ppm, 23.38 ppm, 5.96 ppm relative to that of LC50 values of 1590.74 ppm, 459.30 ppm, 102.68 ppm respectively for the crude leaf extract. The synergistic interactions between the components in the nano-biopesticide formulation can be associated with its greater effectiveness as a promising toxicant to the larvae of the jute caterpillar compared to the mere leaf extract, thereby, demonstrating a greener and safer method for effective pest management.",NA,954

This study assessed the toxicological effects of the commercial fungicide formulations Fantic FNCWG (R) and Ramedit combi (R), both individually and in combination, on honeybees. Using a multi-biomarker approach, we evaluated neurotoxicity, metabolic disturbances, phase II detoxification processes, and immune system function. Our findings revealed that commercial fungicide mixtures with multiple active ingredients affect bees differently than single active compounds. Biomarker responses highlighted how these complex mixtures disrupt various enzymatic pathways; including immune function; altering critical enzyme kinetics involved in detoxification and potentially impairing essential bee functions.

Changes in soil management can influence the structure and organisation of pore space in soil, which drives changes in the transport of particulates and dissolved substances. Formulation of pesticides can be used to change the delivery of active ingredients to soil; however, it is currently unknown how changing the formulation of an herbicide can influence the transport properties between ZT vs. ploughing. We investigated the bioefficacy of two formulations of the herbicide atrazine, a pre- and post-emergence herbicide that inhibits photosystem II. Bioefficacy was assessed using physical measures and survival analysis of an early photosynthesis-dependent weed species, Amaranthus retroflexus L., over time, and soil pore network structure was assessed by analysing three-dimensional images produced by X-ray Computed Tomography. Increasing the herbicide application rate generally improved bioefficacy, though it was reduced in soils managed under ZT. Under herbicide-treated ZT samples, survival time was higher, ranging from 13.4 to 18.2 days compared with 12.6 to 15.4 days in ploughed samples, the mean dry plant mass was higher, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg compared with 0.05 to 0.68 mg in ploughed samples, and the mean total plant length was higher, ranging from 1.73 to 12.1 mm compared with 0.2 to 5.45 mm in ploughed samples. Changes in the soil pore network previously demonstrated to be indicators of preferential transport were correlated with measures of bioefficacy, including pore thickness and connectivity density. Reduced atrazine efficacy under ZT is problematic considering the inherent reliance on chemical methods for weed control, we suggest that pursuing formulation strategies to alleviate potential risks of loss via preferential transport may be fruitful.",NA,956

A key factor in national malaria vector control/elimination programmes is the rate at which these insecticides decay. VECTRON (TM) T500, with broflanilide as its active ingredient, is a recently developed candidate insecticide formulation which has shown promising results in certain phase II experimental hut trials. However, its residual efficacy across different settings has not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated the efficacy of VECTRON (TM) T500 on various wall surfaces (mud, dung, paint, and cement) and assessed its decay rates over time in Ethiopia.MethodsInsectary-reared Anopheles arabiensis Sekoru strain mosquitoes were used to evaluate the residual efficacy of VECTRON (TM) T500. Female mosquitoes, aged three to five days were used for the bioassays. Seven 'tukul' type test huts, each hut with a distinct wall type (mud, dung, painted, and cemented) were used for the study. Three huts received VECTRON (TM) T500; three huts were sprayed with Actellic 300CS, and one hut served as a negative control (sprayed with water only).ResultsVECTRON (TM) T500 induced over 80% mortality across all wall surface types throughout the entire nine-month study period. In contrast, Actellic (R) 300CS achieved over 80% mortality for six months, except on dung wall surfaces, after which its efficacy declined sharply below 80%.ConclusionOverall, the mortality rates achieved with VECTRON (TM) T500 extended up to nine months across all treated wall surface types, outperforming Actellic (R) 300CS.

In this work, the ability of silica materials with different topologies and functionalizations to encapsulate and release neem oil and an azadirachtin-based formulation was evaluated. A material containing titanium has also been prepared as a potential protector against UV radiation. It is observed that the presence of the textural pores of the UVM-7 material favors the capture and modulates the release. On the other hand, the mesopores offer a minor contribution. Regarding functionalization, coatings with amine and alkane groups were tested, which did not improve their properties. The UVM-7 material with and without titanium loaded with Zenith A26 was tested in the field against E. banksi in citrus, showing values of incidence and severity close to the conventional treatment with citrulline.

The current study designed and applied an efficient and eco-friendly nano-herbicide via metamifop (MP) modified by hydrophilic and lipophilic diblock polymer (HLDP), namely MP@HLDP. The HLDP was assembled with MP via electrostatic interaction, and the spontaneous complexation of MP with HLDP formed nearly spherical nanoparticles. The presence of HLDP reduced the contact angle of MP while increasing its retention, resulting in better foliar wettability and easier spreading of the droplets on weed leaves. Meanwhile, the plant uptake of MP@HLDP was enhanced, remarkably improving its herbicidal activity toward weed Echinochloa crus-galli (E. crusgalli), when compared to the commercial emulsion oil and technical compound even at a 30% reduced dosage. The conjoint analysis of transcriptomic and metabolome data indicated activation of the plant death responses by MP@HLDP nanoparticles through inhibiting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and chlorophyll metabolism.

The attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB) strategy is a formulation platform that is amenable to toxicants not otherwise widely used for adult mosquito control techniques and equipment. To find fast-acting, effective toxicants for ATSB, choice assays were conducted using fipronil, spinosyn, dinotefuran, clothianidin, imidacloprid, bifenazate, indoxacarb, abamectin, and lambda-cyhalothrin against Aedes aegypti (L.)

Treatments were presented in tandem with unadulterated 10% sucrose in all assays. In both 24-h mortality and fecal droplet analysis, indoxacarb was ingested similarly as often as the sugar water-only control group and yielded the overall lowest mortality. Imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, and abamectin were all readily ingested, and in some cases the fecal droplet analysis indicated bias towards consumption of the treated sugar solutions. Mortality in the first 24 h was over 95% for the aforementioned toxicants, supporting that they both kill in limited time and have a suitable palatability or repellency response profile with mosquitoes. But imidacloprid and lambda-cyhalothrin (resistance) and imidacloprid (pollinators) have roadblocks for use in ATSB because of potential nontarget impact to pollinators and prevalent insecticide resistance issues.

The nanocapsule exhibited better storing stability, anti-photolysis property, foliar wettability, and retention, as compared to the conventional concentrated emulsion of EB (EB-EC). Incorporation into the nanocapsule retarded the release of EB, which was pH-sensitive and dependent on the structure of the nanocapsule. A better sustaining effect could be achieved by an increase of SA or a reduction of CTAB and in a basic environment, due to the enhanced interaction between the active ingredient and the shell matrix of the nanocapsule. The incorporation into the nanocapsule greatly increased the activity of EB.

Methods: This study evaluated five fruit juices as ATSBs for mosquitoes, focusing on feeding preferences. Preservative concentrations were assessed by measuring antimicrobial activity over time. Two commercial traps were tested for mosquito entry rates. The optimal insecticide species and concentration were determined based on mortality rates. An optimized ATSBs system was developed and tested under a semi-field cage. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Results: Within 24 h, apple juice-based ATSBs had the highest attractant index for Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles sinensis, while a pear juice-based ATSB was most effective for Aedes albopictus.

For mite control, several synthetic active principles are commercially available. However, these formulations are proving less effective due to the acquisition of resistance mechanisms by the parasite. Naturally derived compounds, such as essential oils, are less prone to generating resistance mechanisms in mite populations and have been proven effective in numerous independent laboratory investigations. In this study, semi-field and field tests were conducted to evaluate the acaricidal efficacy of two essential oils (Citrus bergamia and Citrus limon), which, in our previous residual contact toxicity tests, showed efficacy against Varroa mites. For semi-field cage tests, two-level cages were set up. Filter paper soaked with different concentrations of essential oils was placed in the lower compartment of the cage; 20 honeybees and 10 Varroa mites were allocated in the upper level. Mite detachment from the honeybees was evaluated after 24 and 48 h.

We used this pipeline to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three dermato-cosmetic products massively sold at the time of the study in the Montpellier area (South of France): a sunscreen containing UV filters, a mosquito repellent (with synthetic active ingredient IR3535) and a product combining a natural insect repellent plus a sunscreen. Hematoxylin and eosin or hematoxylin-eosin saffron staining was performed to assess skin structure before morphometric parameter computation.ResultsWe report the identification of a specific nuclear feature based on variation in texture information that can be used to assess skin tissue damage after oxidative stress or UV exposure. Our data show that application of the commercial sun cream provided efficient protection against UV effects in our ex vivo skin model, whereas application of the mosquito repellent as a single product exerted no protective or toxic effect. Notably, we found that concurrent application of the insect repellent with the sunscreen significantly decreased the UVB protective effect of the sunscreen. Last, histometric analysis of human skin biopsies from multiple donors indicates that the sunscreen-insect repellent combo displayed variable levels of protection against UV irradiation.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the potential toxicity of combining real-life sunscreen and insect repellent products using ex vivo human skin samples, which most closely imitate the cutaneous physiology.

Subsequently, asymmetric wetting Janus nanopesticide delivery systems (Thi@AWJ-MSN) were constructed by encapsulating the model pesticide molecule, thiafuramide (Thi). The coexistence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments on the AWJ-MSN imparts interfacial activity, enhancing spreadability on plant leaves with different wettability (Brassica chinensis L., Cucumis sativus L., and Arachis hypogaea L.). The droplet impact behavior of the AWJ-MSN on plant leaves and artificial PTFE membrane surfaces was analyzed through normalization, revealing a reduced normalized spreading height (H t/D 0) and an increased normalized spreading diameter (D t/D 0). These findings indicate the enhanced foliar deposition ability of the AWJ-MSN under real-world foliar spraying conditions. Furthermore, the encapsulation of Thi within the nanocarriers protects the active pesticide ingredients, enabling sustained release through quasi-Fickian diffusion and ultimately prolonging the pesticide's efficacy.

We measured biomarkers that included detoxification responses (glutathione S-transferase, GST), oxidative stress levels (lipid peroxidation, LPO, and catalase, CAT), DNA damage (comet assay), energy reserves (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and immune response (lysozyme activity, LYS). The absence of significant differences in catalase and lipid peroxidation levels suggested no oxidative stress due to fungicide exposure. However, the foliar fungicide Amistar (R) Xtra induced the highest GST activity and DNA fragmentation, suggesting synergistic effects between its active ingredients and undisclosed co-formulants. Similar effects observed with the Amistar (R) Xtra-Prosaro (R) mixture confirmed the greater toxicity of Amistar (R) Xtra.

Here we investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan (R) SG (active ingredient acetamiprid) on plant bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae), a dominant group of European grassland insect communities. In a controlled field study, the abundance of three focal species was reduced by up to 92% two days after field exposure at concentrations expected at field margins, with mortality varying among species. Follow-up feeding assays with insecticide-treated host plants in the greenhouse and controlled dose-response laboratory assays confirmed the strong negative effects on non-target species. Strikingly, when comparing the lethal dose 50 derived from Mospilan (R) SG with a value reported for honeybees using another acetamiprid formulation, the insecticide was over 11,000 times more toxic to plant bugs than to honeybees. In addition, males were 20 times more sensitive than females in the two tested species. Thus, continuous exposure to this neonicotinoid may reduce plant bug populations and promote insecticide-tolerant species, altering community composition. We suggest that sex-specific sensitivity be considered in risk assessment and conclude that the true risk to non-target insects is currently greatly underestimated.",NA,973

In this work, two biosurfactant extracts were produced successfully at a pilot scale using CSL. One was more hydrophobic and was obtained through liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate (BS-ACT). The other was more hydrophilic, obtained through solid-liquid extraction with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (BS-PBS). RESULTS: The biosurfactant extracts (BS-ACT and BS-PBS) were included in biocide formulations to assess their impact on enhancing the suspensibility and solubility of different metallic active substances. The BS-PBS extract exhibited superior properties in suspending biocides in comparison with BS-ACT, despite BS-ACT demonstrating a higher solubility capacity. Moreover, in comparison with chemical surfactants, BS-ACT displayed significantly greater ability to solubilize biocides in water, whereas BS-PBS showed suspensibility results that were comparable with synthetic surfactants.

Essential oils extracted from O. vulgare leaves cultivated in Germany, Albania, and Iran were analyzed. Among them, the German oil exhibited the highest acaricidal potency due to its elevated carvacrol content (83.38%). Carvacrol was isolated and its identity was confirmed using GC/MS, NMR, and FT-IR analyses. Carvacrol demonstrated significant toxicity across all developmental stages of H. longicornis, with LC50 values of 3.47, 8.21, and 15.27 mu g/cm3 for larvae, nymphs, and adults, respectively-representing 4.4-, 3.5-, and 3.2-fold higher potency compared to diethyltoluamide. The acaricidal mechanism of carvacrol involved multiple pathways: (i) inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity by up to 85.4%, leading to neural disruption; (ii) suppression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (47.4% reduction), alpha-esterase (24.8% reduction), and beta-esterase (28.6% reduction); and (iii) disruption of neural signaling pathways critical for survival. Chemical analysis confirmed carvacrol as the predominant active component in O. vulgare oil, with additional contributions from thymol and thymoquinone. Although its concentration in Iranian oil was lower, thymoquinone demonstrated the highest acaricidal potency (4.98 mu g/cm3). Nevertheless, the abundance and superior efficacy of carvacrol establish it as the primary component contributing to the oil's bioactivity. This study demonstrates that carvacrol is a promising eco-friendly alternative to synthetic acaricides for the control of H. longicornis. Its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and suppress detoxifying enzymes suggests potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms associated with synthetic chemicals.

Whilst research on herbicides in relation to bees is growing, we still have more to learn about how bees may interact with herbicides and the subsequent consequences for bee health. As herbicides are designed to kill the plants they are applied to, bees and other pollinators may interact with them in a different way to other pesticide groups which is important to understand in the context of evaluating hazard and risk. Here, we conducted both a choice and no-choice test, to determine if bumblebees would be deterred from foraging from feeders containing commercial formulations of Roundup (Ultra and Biactive, respectively) compared to controls. We found across both experiments that bees were deterred from foraging where feeders contained above field-realistic concentrations of Roundup formulation, and that on average colonies reduced their consumption from these feeders by similar to 50% despite lacking other food sources. This demonstrates that, when given no choice, bees can be deterred from sucrose containing Roundup Biactive, although above expected field concentrations, even to their own nutritional detriment. Separately, individual foragers were observed avoiding feeders containing field-realistic levels of Roundup Ultra compared to controls, showing a preference for uncontaminated feed when given a choice. As this was an experimental setup using high concentrations of Roundup with sucrose solution rather than real flowers, more work is needed to understand this phenomenon under field conditions. This work provides useful information and insights for future studies investigating the impacts of glyphosate in the form of both active substance and formulation on bees and could also be useful in identifying future mitigation strategies for field use.",NA,977

This is leading to diseases of economic importance in animals such that farmer`s budgetary allocation is constrained. Recently, interventions involving the use of plant based anti-tick products has shown promising results. Hence, in the present study, a tick grease was developed and evaluated utilising terpenes and terpenoids from Cissus quadrangularis as principal active components. Terpene and terpenoid rich extracts were isolated using a normal phase silica gel packed column and active fraction determined using repellence and knockdown effect. Ethyl acetate was used to extract the terpenes and terpenoids from dried Cissus quadrangularis stems. The chemical composition of the active fraction was evaluated using GC-MS. The formulated tick grease was evaluated under both laboratory and field studies. Out of the six column isolated fractions only 2, eluted with hexane: ethyl acetate ratio: 8:2 (100 mL), and 7:3 (100 mL), showed significant acaricidal activity with a percentage knockdown effect of 100 and 75% respectively. The GC-MS analysis of the combine two fractions showed that, they consisted of various monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Copaene (14.56%), alpha-ocimene (42.23%), murolene (16.98%) and caryophyllene oxide (11.89%) were found to be the major occurring compounds in the fraction. The tick grease formulated with the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes rich fraction showed significant acaricidal activity when compared to commercial acaricide, armitraz purchased from local veterinary shops. The tick grease showed percent repellence of 100% as compared to 75% for the commercial acaricide. Under field studies, by topical application on cows the tick grease knocked down all ticks including Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Amblyomma variegatum species which were resistant to the commercial acaricide. It also showed good protective effect over the 5 day period selected for the study on non-tick infested cows.

However, they can impact non-target soil organisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of eight seed treatments (including two authorized for organic farming) on root colonization of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. One experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions, on a sterile substrate inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833 and one in field conditions, where winter wheat was colonized by native soil AM fungi. In greenhouse conditions, the six conventional seed treatments reduced root colonization five weeks after sowing. No difference with the control treatment was measured thereafter for a product containing triazole alone. In contrast, seed treatments containing fludioxonil (fungicide molecule alone or formulated with the triazole difenoconazole), and prochloraz formulated with the triazole triticonazole significantly reduced root colonization until 11 weeks after sowing. Notably, when formulated with sedaxane, the adverse effect of fludioxonil was reduced. The negative effect of seed treatments on AM fungal root colonization in field was smaller than in the greenhouse and generally not significant, with disparate results from one timestep to another. This may be related to the dilution or the degradation of the active ingredients in the soil during the winter period or AM fungal species/strain involved in symbiosis. Overall, our results outline that the direct effect of seed treatment is highly variable depending on the modes of action, half-lives and interactions between active ingredients. By contributing to highlight the undesired effects of pesticides on AM fungi (i.e., by delaying root colonization), this study pleads for a reduction of pesticide applications to encourage the rapid and efficient establishment of functional mycorrhizal symbioses.",NA,979

The main objective is to improve the ingredient concentrations maximizing the insecticidal activity of the biofilm and to study the desorption of Calothrixin A according to the diffusion parameters. Eight biofilm formulations were prepared with different concentrations of the components and tested on Sitona lineatus and Bruchus pisorum. The results show that a high concentration of Calothrixin A tended to increase insecticidal activity, although this increase was not always significant, while a higher concentration of collagen and chitosan reduced insecticidal activity, probably by limiting the diffusion of the active ingredient. The prediction models for insecticidal activity showed that the interaction of the factors had no significant impact on the responses, but the model for Sitona lineatus presented better accuracy. The diffusion tests revealed that the CB3C-5 biofilm, with high diffusion parameters, correlated with insecticidal activity. The characterization of the CB3C-5 biofilm showed adequate physical, mechanical, thermal, and structural properties for agricultural seed storage application. Moreover, the computational approach showed that Calothrixin A interacts more efficiently with the OR5-Orco complex than with the small OBP, disrupting the olfactory detection of insects.

Adult S. zeamais were first exposed to the vials treated with PBO or acetone (solvent control) for 1 h or 3 h, then exposed to either alpha-cypermethrin LLIN or control netting for 1 h or 3 h. Immediate mortality was recorded directly after exposure, as well as delayed mortality at 24, 48, 72, and 168 h later with adult conditions recorded as alive, affected, or dead. At 1-h exposure, the addition of PBO significantly reduced the percentage of field strain S. zeamais adults alive by 7-42% after subsequently exposed to LLIN compared to the control, but PBO did not significantly affect the percentage of alive pyrethroid-resistant adults. After a 3-h exposure, there were significantly fewer field strain (by 24-47%) and pyrethroid-resistant (by 13-36%) individuals alive when exposed to PBO compared to the control.

This comparative study was carried out with four populations of R. microplus from four Brazilian farms. For laboratory assays, technical grade compounds of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were used in the LPT, while fipronil and ivermectin were used in the LIT. The AIT was conducted using commercial spray formulations containing pyrethroid and organophosphate: cypermethrin 187.5 ppm + chlorpyrifos 375 ppm + fenthion 187.5 ppm and chlorpyrifos 825 ppm + High-Cis cypermethrin 99 ppm.

For field studies, populations of R. microplus with the mean therapeutic efficacy <= 89 %, on days 7 up to 21 post-treatment, were classified as resistant to such compounds. To standardize the comparative analysis between laboratory and field results, this same value of larval efficacy or mortality (<= 89 %) was used to classify the population as resistant by laboratory tests (LPT, LIT, and AIT).

We then analyzed the life-history traits of the experimental bees using radio frequency identification technology over three sessions (May, June, and August) to assess the potential seasonal dependence of the solvent effects. Our results highlight the substantial influence of in vitro larval rearing on the life cycle of bees, with a 47.7% decrease in life span, a decrease of 0.9 days in the age at first exit, an increase of 57.3% in the loss rate at first exit, and a decrease of 40.6% in foraging tenure.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay. Methodology/Principal findings Using standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifi-cally enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evalu-ate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. © 2023 Ashu et al.",NA,987

This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT® and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00–1.49 mg of the active ingredient·kg−1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT® at ≥0.66 mg kg−1 and SPIN at ≥0.13 mg kg−1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT® at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg−1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT® and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT® and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT® on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT® and SPIN. The results suggest that spinosyns-based products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors",NA,988

The aim of this study was to evaluate the lethal effects of the active ingredient and a commercial formulation of IVM (1 % active ingredient) in the embryonic stage (S. 4–6) and larval stage (S. 25) of the South American amphibian Rhinella arenarum through chronic standardized bioassays. Also, behavior analysis and oxidative stress and cholinergic effects biomarkers were analyzed at 1, 10 and 100 μg IVM/L concentrations. For the embryonic stage, the active ingredient (96 h- LC50: 15900 μg/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC50: 51230 μg/L) during the acute period, while at chronic exposure the commercial formulation was more toxic (504 h-LC50: 10.25 μg/L), compared to the active ingredient (504 h-LC50: 312.80 μg/L). For the larval stage, in acute exposure, the active ingredient (96 h-LC50: 800 μg/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC50: 1550 μg/L). In the chronic exposure, the commercial formulation (504 h-LC50: 77.33 μg/L) was more toxic than the active ingredient (504 h-LC50: 195.25 μg/L). Overall, larvae exhibited greater sensitivity to both the active ingredient and the commercial formulation. However, during chronic exposure, embryos were more sensitive to the commercial formulation than larvae. The commercial formulation primarily induced oxidative stress, and both forms of the compound affected behavior and cholinergic effect biomarkers, even at low environmentally relevant concentrations (1 μg/L). These results highlight the potential impact of IVM on aquatic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",NA,989

Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs. This study demonstrates a conflict between insect pest management and Lepidoptera conservation during ornamental plant production and has implications for the conservation value of ornamentals after retail sale.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Synthetic insecticides have mostly been used to combat this pest, raising human and environmental health concerns. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could compensate for or augment the harmful effects of agrochemicals. Herein, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in corn plants impact the host-plant selection behavior of S. litura. Headspace volatile organic compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Larvae fed inoculated corn exhibited lower weights and relative growth rate than noninoculated plants. Under choice experiments, PGPR-treated plants significantly reduced percentage leaf damage area and oviposition rate compared to untreated plants. Volatile organic compound ratio emission varied significantly between control and PGPR treatments, which, in part, explains feeding and oviposition deterrence in PGPR-treated plants. The results demonstrate that PGPR inoculation can enhance corn resistance to S. litura, making it a promising candidate for crop protection strategies.  © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,991

Despite this, little is known regarding the effects of trisiloxane surfactants on important aspects of colony health, such as reproduction. In the present study, we use laboratory assays to examine how exposure to field-relevant concentrations of three trisiloxane surfactants found in commonly used adjuvant formulations affect queen oviposition rates, worker interactions with the queen, and worker susceptibility to endogenous viral pathogens. Trisiloxane surfactants were administered at 5 mg/kg in pollen supplement diet for 14 days. No effects on worker behavior or physiology could be detected, but our results demonstrate that hydroxy-capped trisiloxane surfactants can negatively affect queen oviposition and methyl-capped trisiloxane surfactants cause increased replication of Deformed Wing Virus in workers, suggesting that trisiloxane surfactant use while honey bees are foraging may negatively impact colony longevity and growth.

To enhance the efficacy of the active ingredient, GBHs used in practice often contain other ingredients marked as inert “adjuvants” or “co-formulants”, the toxic properties of which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of pure glyphosate, three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) and two co-formulants commonly used in GBHs as assessed via CCK-8 assay, and the extent of their potential oxidative damage as assessed via superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, in order to reveal the role of adjuvants in the toxicity of the formulations. Our results showed that glyphosate alone did not significantly affect cell viability. In contrast, GBHs and adjuvants induced a pronounced cytotoxic effect from a concentration of 100 μM. SOD activity of cells treated with GBHs or adjuvants was significantly lower compared to cells treated with glyphosate alone. This suggests that the adjuvants in GBHs are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the formulations through the induction of oxidative stress. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,993

PPPs do not only affect target organisms but also affect non-targets, such as the honey bee Apis mellifera and their microbiome. This study is the first of its kind, aiming to characterize the effect of PPPs on the microbiome of the cuticle of honey bees. We chose PPPs, which have frequently been detected in bee bread, and studied their effects on the cuticular microbial community and function of the bees. The effects of the fungicide Difcor® (difenoconazole), the insecticide Steward® (indoxacarb), the combination of both (mix A) and the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid and dimoxystrobin), the insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid), and the combination of both (mix B) were tested. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal transcribed spacer region gene-based amplicon sequencing and quantification of gene copy numbers were carried out after nucleic acid extraction from the cuticle of honey bees. The treatment with Steward® significantly affected fungal community composition and function. The fungal gene copy numbers were lower on the cuticle of bees treated with Difcor®, Steward®, and PPP mix A in comparison with the controls. However, bacterial and fungal gene copy numbers were increased in bees treated with Cantus® Gold, Mospilan®, or PPP mix B compared to the controls. The bacterial cuticular community composition of bees treated with Cantus® Gold, Mospilan®, and PPP mix B differed significantly from the control. In addition, Mospilan® on its own significantly changed the bacterial functional community composition. Cantus® Gold significantly affected fungal gene copy numbers, community, and functional composition. Our results demonstrate that PPPs show adverse effects on the cuticular microbiome of honey bees and suggest that PPP mixtures can cause stronger effects on the cuticular community than a PPP alone. The cuticular community composition was more diverse after the PPP mix treatments. This may have far-reaching consequences for the health of honey bees.

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS: We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION: We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and “inert” ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of “inert” ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Herein, a multi-stimuli-responsive nano/microcapsule bidirectional delivery system loaded with pyraclostrobin (Pyr) is prepared through interfacial cross-linking from a lignin-based Pickering emulsion template. During this process, methacrylated alkali lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are utilized as stabilizers for the tunable oil-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion. Subsequently, a thiol-ene radical reaction occurs with the acid-labile cross-linkers at the oil-water interface, leading to the formation of lignin nano/microcapsules (LNCs) with various topological shapes. Through the investigation of the polymerization process and the structure of LNC, it was found that the amphiphilicity-driven diffusion and distribution of cyclohexanone impact the topology of LNC. The obtained Pyr@LNC exhibits high encapsulation efficiency, tunable size, and excellent UV shielding to Pyr. Additionally, the flexible topology of the Pyr@LNC shell enhances the retention and adhesion of the foliar surface. Furthermore, Pyr@LNC exhibits pH/laccase-responsive targeting against Botrytis disease, enabling the intelligent release of Pyr. The in vivo fungicidal activity shows that efficacy of Pyr@LNC is 53% ± 2% at 14 days postspraying, whereas the effectiveness of Pyr suspension concentrate is only 29% ± 4%, and the acute toxicity of Pyr@LNC to zebrafish is reduced by more than 9-fold compared with that of Pyr technical. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that the LNCs can be bidirectionally translocated in plants. Therefore, the topology-regulated bidirectional delivery system LNC has great practical potential for sustainable agriculture. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",NA,996

The essential oil (EO) of citronella grass, Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, known for its repellent activity against many insects, is considered as source of potential bio-pesticides. In the present study, citronella oil was extracted from the leaves by hydro-distillation method and analysed for chemical constituents using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The phytochemical profiling of the same revealed the presence of thirteen mono- and sesqui-terpenoids, the major compounds being citronellal (26.38%), trans geraniol (24.61%) and citronellol (13.80%). A stable and homogeneous oil in water (O/W) nano-emulsion of citronella essential oil with oil content (15%) and Tween 80 (5%) was formulated and characterised for average diameter and surface charge on its droplets using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of nanometric spherical droplets. In laboratory bioassays, mortality of S. litura larvae was 100% at 10.0 mg mL−1 and 12.50 mg mL−1 concentrations of citronella EO and its nano-emulsion, respectively. The LC50 values were 5.52 mg mL−1 on oil and 4.19 mg mL−1 on nano-emulsion. Larval feeding on leaf discs treated with citronella EO and its nano-emulsion was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The Antifeedant Index (AFI) values at 25.0 mg mL−1 of citronella oil and its nano-emulsion were 33.78 and 51.83, respectively. Both citronella EO and its nano-emulsion are potential candidates for development of botanical insecticides to control S. litura.

The spray adjuvant ‘Jiexiaoli,’ a primary organosilicon spray agent in China, was identified as hydroxy (polyethylene) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H) with 3–15 ethoxy (EO) groups. Purification of TSS-H was achieved through semi-preparative separation using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), resulting in TSS-H purity exceeding 96%. An accurate residual detection method for nine oligomers (4–12 EO) of TSS-H in rice roots, stems, leaves, and culture solution samples was developed using HPLC tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Recoveries for nine oligomers of TSS-H in the four matrices ranged from 80.22% to 104.01%. Foliar application experiments demonstrated that TSS-H did not transfer from the upper to the lower parts of the rice plant. The half-lives of each oligomer (4–12 EO) in leaves were less than 3.21 days. Root application experiments revealed a root concentration factor (RCF) ranging from 0.20 to 0.56, a biological enrichment factor (BCF) ranging from 0.36 to 0.68, a transpiration factor (TSCF) ranging from 0.069 to 0.086, and a transport factor (TF) ranging from 0.08 to 0.43. These results indicated that TSS-H could be absorbed by rice roots and conducted to the above-ground parts of rice plants.

While many (eco)toxicology studies are performed in the laboratory under highly controlled circumstances, these studies may disregard the nuances and disorder that come with the complexity of natural aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments using laboratory system water, different lake waters, and different water parameters to determine the effects of ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D (0.00–4.00 ppm a.e.) on the development and survival of two freshwater game species (Sander vitreus and Esox lucius). For 2,4-D exposures using different water sources, there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and water source on walleye embryo and larval survival, however, there was no significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and water source. For 2,4-D exposures and pH (5–9 pH), there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and pH on walleye and northern pike embryo survival and a significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and pH. Our results indicate that 2,4-D exposures in controlled laboratory system water can predict similar outcomes as 2,4-D exposures in natural lake water. Moreover, individual water parameters, such as pH, play a significant role in the toxicity of 2,4-D. Taken together, these results suggest that highly controlled laboratory studies are a useful tool for predicting impacts on survival of non-target fish in natural waters, but it is crucial for management agencies to consider individual water sources and specific lake water parameters in herbicide risk assessments to minimize the impacts to non-target organism. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,999

These studies were undertaken to provide important new information about the potential for the enhanced neurotoxicity of herbicides following nasal inhalation. Materials and Methods: Transport of atrazine from aqueous solution and from commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products was assessed using excised nasal mucosal tissues. The permeation rate and the role of membrane transporters in the uptake of atrazine across the nasal mucosa were also investigated. Histological examination of the nasal tissues was conducted to assess the effects of commercial atrazine-containing products on nasal tissue morphology. Results: Atrazine showed high flux across both nasal respiratory and olfactory tissues, and efflux transporters were found to play an essential role in limiting its uptake at low exposure concentrations. Commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products showed remarkably high transfer across the nasal tissues, and histological evaluation showed significant changes in the morphology of the nasal epithelium following exposure to the herbicide products. Discussion: Lipophilic herbicides such as atrazine can freely permeate across the nasal mucosa despite the activity of efflux transporters. The adjuvant compounds in commercial herbicide products disrupt the nasal mucosa’s epithelial barrier, resulting in even greater atrazine permeation across the tissues. The properties of the herbicide itself and those of the formulated products play crucial roles in the potential for the enhanced neurotoxicity of herbicides following nasal inhalation. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,1003

However, there has been controversy about whether it is toxic to the nervous system. In order to explore this issue in depth, the present study analyzed the molecular mechanism of action of glyphosate from four perspectives, namely, gene regulation, protein expression, morphological changes, and behavioral changes, and assessed the potential effects of glyphosate on the development of the nervous system of zebrafish through the establishment of a zebrafish model. The results showed that zebrafish embryos at 6 hpf after fertilization were exposed to glyphosate until 72 and 120 hpf. After exposure, it was found that the central nervous development-related gene Elavl3 was down-regulated, and GAP-43, Neurog1, and GFAP were up-regulated. The expression of HuC protein, which is used to maintain neuronal axonal homeostasis, was significantly reduced, and the expression of GFAP protein, which is used to repair neurological damage and inflammation, was significantly increased. Under the regulation of related genes and proteins, zebrafish larvae show abnormal changes during the development of a series of nervous systems such as heart rate slowing, somite shortening, spinal and brain malformations. At the same time, the zebrafish's action behavior also changed, with a significant decrease in its total time share in the low-speed shift and high-speed shift states, and a delayed response to dark-light environmental stimuli. In summary, studies have shown that glyphosate exposure may induce damage and inflammation of the zebrafish nervous system, resulting in developmental malformations, abnormal motor behavior, and potential neurotoxicity. Therefore, the possible neurotoxicity and environmental risks of glyphosate to aquatic animals should not be ignored and should be of great concern. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",NA,1004

Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations. In addition, the honeybee seems to be quite robust when it comes to effects of plant protection products, while wild bees might be more sensitive. © 2023 The Authors",NA,1005

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al.

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing pesticide risks. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,1007

The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) the effects of the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, on the freshwater copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi; and (ii) the survival and the feeding rate of copepods after the exposure. Acute toxicity tests using the commercial formulations of fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, were performed. The LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h of fipronil to N. iheringi were 2.38 ± 0.48, 3.08 ± 1.14, and 4.97 ± 3.30 μg L−1, respectively. For 2,4-D the LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h were 371.18 ± 29.20, 406.93 ± 53.77, and 478.24 ± 107.77 mg L−1, respectively. Morphological damages on the copepods exposed to pesticides were observed at all concentrations. Fungal filaments covering dead organisms were presented at the treatment highest concentration (R5:7.43 ± 2.78 μg L−1 fipronil). The mixture of the pesticides presented synergistic effects on the mortality of N. iheringi. Post-exposure tests showed no difference between the treatments and the control on the mortality and on the feeding rate for 4 h. However, since delayed toxicity of pesticides can occur, longer post-exposure tests using N. iheringi should be tested.

In response to these concerns, we have purified the active components of these adjuvants, specifically a series of oligomers of hydroxy(polyethyleneoxy) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H), including ethylene oxide (EO) units ranging from 4 to 12. For analysis of TSS-H in zebrafish and water, a method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC[sbnd]HRMS) was developed. The findings revealed that at total TSS-H concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg, the average recovery rate of TSS-H containing 4 to 12 EO units in zebrafish ranged from 81.2 % to 107.2 %, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0.1 % and 8.4 %. The 96-hour LC50 of TSS-H in zebrafish was 6.71±0.04 mg/L. At exposure concentrations of 0.0671 mg/L and 0.671 mg/L, TSS-H oligomers reached a steady state in zebrafish within 14–21 days, with concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 0.05 mg/kg and 0.018 to 0.348 mg/kg, respectively. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for TSS-H oligomers (4–12 EO units) were 1.87–11.59 at the low dose and 0.79–9.19 at the high dose after 14 days. The elimination half-lives of the oligomers were <2.37 days during the elimination phase. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed both TSS-H doses significantly impacted lipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, with disruptions largely associated with abnormal energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and alterations in membrane composition. These findings are critical for assessing the food safety and environmental risks of agrochemical organosilicone spray adjuvants in fish. © 2025",NA,1009

According to studies investigating the nutritional value and health effects of organic and conventional foods, it is known that organic and conventional foods do not have significant differences in terms of nutritional value, but pesticides and other residues used in the production of conventional foods have negative effects on health. When the results of studies comparing the effects of pesticide levels—antibiotic ratio, heavy metal, mycotoxin, nitrate and nitrite content of organic and conventional foods—on human health are examined, it has been seen that organic foods are more effective in terms of health protection and improvement compared to conventional foods. Due to the insufficiency of the existing studies, it cannot be concluded that organic foods have more beneficial effects on health than conventional foods.

Given its several benefits, FIP is widely used in the agricultural and veterinary medicine fields, but its indiscriminate use can have ecotoxic effects on non-target species. Thus, the current study aimed to summarise and critically analyse FIP's ecotoxicity in aquatic animals. Data referring to bibliometric parameters (publication year and geographical distribution), experimental conditions (field and laboratory, FIP type, animal class, species, habitat, and exposure conditions), and biomarkers (oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurotoxicity, and morphological changes) were summarised and critically analysed. Ecotoxicological studies were mainly conducted with insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Exposure to pure FIP or FIP-based commercial formulation can induce mortality and have sublethal effects on non-target organisms, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage, genotoxicity (DNA damage), neurotoxicity, and morphological changes. The herein reviewed data have evidenced high median lethal FIP concentration (LC50) in vertebrates in comparison to invertebrates. The current findings confirmed that FIP can have several effects on aquatic organisms, besides suggesting potential ecotoxicological risks posed by this insecticide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,1012

Organosiloxane-based adjuvants are widely used as additives for daily chemicals and textile products, but also as agrochemical adjuvants in agriculture due to their super spreading and penetrating abilities. At present, China’s production and sales of silicone products have reached above 2 million tons, accounting for more than 50% of the world’s total amount. China has become the world’s largest producer, consumer and net exporter of raw materials of silicone, and the production capacity of polysiloxane has reached more than 60% of the world’s total. As organosiloxane residues detected in environment (especially in water, sludge/soil and other environmental samples, aquatic food chain, as well as human tissues), their impacts on agricultural ecological environment are increasingly exposed due to the widely application of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, while the environmental risks from silicone-based agrochemical adjuvants, including ecotoxicity and environmental safety risks, have also attracted great concern. In recent years, volatile cyclomethylcyclosiloxanes (such as D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), D5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) and D6 (dodecylcyclohexasiloxane)) have been recognized as emerging organic pollutants, or listed as priority controlled chemicals by EU and other countries, because of their environmental persistence, bioaccumulation and potential toxicity. Based on the relevant scientific research literatures published since 1991 on the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants and the ecological environmental safety risks in the use of organosiloxane-based adjuvant (including organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants), this paper reviewed and analyzed the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and their impacts directly or indirectly on agricultural ecological environmental safety. This review mainly focused on the following two aspects: (1) the organosiloxane residues in environment and their impacts on the agricultural ecological environment safety, including organosiloxane residues and fates in the process of wastewater treatment, aquatic food chain pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in water, soil ecological pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in sludge, and human health risks from organosiloxane residues in food; (2) the current situation and environmental safety risks for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, including organosiloxane residues and ecotoxicity risks from siloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, and the management for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants. This paper also discussed the management status and problems associated with siloxane-based products. For organosiloxane as agrochemical adjuvants, organosiloxane-based adjuvants were largely assumed to be “biologically inert”, and usually no risk assessment (such as ecotoxicity test and environmental monitoring) was required. Also, the adjuvant inert ingredients were generally protected as “trade-secrets” or confidential business information, and the inert ingredients were rarely identified on product labels. At present, there are no regulatory requirements for the use of organosilicone-based adjuvants in fertilizer products as agrochemical adjuvants (such as foliar fertilizer additives) in China, posing potential environmental safety risks. This paper discussed that over-addition with organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants might increase their residues in soil-crop-water systems, and their ecotoxicity risks, as well as potential threats to food safety and human health. It is suggested that relevant management and research units need to pay more attention to environmental monitoring for organosiloxane residues and fates in the application process of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and especially strengthen the research on the impacts of organosiloxane residues from organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants on water, soil, animal and plant growth, as well as human health. © 2024 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Nevertheless, glyphosate has been shown to bioaccumulate in the tissues of several organisms. To understand the bioconcentration dynamics of glyphosate in fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta forma fario) of different age were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, the formulation Roundup® LB Plus, and the major transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) for two, three, or four weeks at different temperatures in the laboratory. Mortality rates were determined, and tissue samples were collected at the end of the experiment to ascertain concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA residues by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Results: Brown trout mortality during exposure to glyphosate or AMPA was considerably higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C. Also, a significant increase in glyphosate concentrations in samples containing muscle, head, backbone, and caudal fin tissue with increasing exposure concentrations and temperatures was observed. Six-month-old fish contained more glyphosate per kg wet weight after exposure than ten-month-old fish. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for glyphosate and AMPA were much higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C, but in both cases decreased with higher glyphosate concentrations. The BCF for glyphosate formulated in Roundup® was higher than the one for the parent compound. Approximately 30–42% of the organ-absorbed glyphosate and AMPA remained in the tissues even when the fish were kept in clean water lacking the test substances for three weeks after termination of exposure. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that there is an interaction between glyphosate and ambient temperature in terms of toxicity. Further it was shown that increasing concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the surrounding media lead to significantly increased concentrations of these substances in brown trout tissues, although neither bioconcentration nor bioaccumulation of glyphosate in animal tissues is expected due to the high water solubility of this chemical. As a consequence, the uptake of glyphosate by humans through the consumption of contaminated edible fish is very likely. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,1014

To this end, the activities of the enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), lipid hydroperoxide (LH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were measured after 48 h of exposure to the different pesticide treatments. The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations. It is concluded that the commercial formulations Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC® and their mixtures cause significant alterations in the detoxification metabolism of exposed organisms and induce oxidative stress in fish. © 2024",NA,1015

Non-dietary risk assessments involve estimating the amount of residue which can be transferred from plant foliage to the skin or clothes, known as dislodgeable foliar residues (DFRs). DFR data are less available than crop residue data as studies are costly and limited by seasonality. European regulatory authorities are reticent to allow extrapolation of study data to different scenarios as the contributory factors have hitherto been poorly identified. This study is the first to use a new laboratory DFR method to investigate how one such factor, pesticide formulation, may affect DFR on a variety of crops. The study used the active substance difenoconazole as both an emulsifiable concentrate (EC 10%) and a wettable powder (WP 10%) with and without adjuvants (Tween 20 and organophosphate tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate TEHP) on tomato, French bean and oilseed rape. A comparable DFR% was retained from the WP and EC formulation on most crops except for tomato, where lower DFR% was retained in the case of WP (39 ± 4.7%) compared to EC (60 ± 1.2%). No significant effect of adjuvant addition was observed for either formulation except when mixing TEHP (0.1% w/v) to the EC 10% on French bean, resulting in 8% DFR reduction compared to the EC formulation alone.

These abilities can be severely affected by plant protection products (PPPs). However, risk assessment of PPPs often focusses on mortality, neglecting long-term sublethal effects, which might ultimately lead to the death of entire insect colonies. While neonicotinoids targeting sucking insects in numerous agricultural plants have largely banned from the European market, they are still widespread in the rest of the world, although they have a high potential for toxicity in beneficial insects. Particularly the combination of neonicotinoids with fungicides has allegedly led to serious effects on pollinators, but detailed studies on this subject are still rare. We here investigated the effects of two frequent fungicides, the non-sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicide Cantus® Gold (active ingredients: boscalid/dimoxystrobin) and the sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicide Difcor® 250 EC (active ingredient: difenoconazole) in combination with the neonicotinoid Mospilan® (active ingredient: acetamiprid). Cognitive abilities were studied using classical olfactory proboscis extension learning (PER learning). Responses to sucrose were investigated prior to learning, because learning performance is determined by sugar responsiveness to a large degree. The neonicotinoid reduced both sucrose responsiveness and olfactory PER learning when applied at a concentration of 20 mg/l but not in the concentration of 2 mg/l. This insecticide effect persisted in combination with the non-SBI (sterol biosynthesis inhibiting) fungicide (Cantus® Gold, 1 mg/l). Unexpectedly, the effect of the insecticide disappeared when mixed with an SBI fungicide (Difcor® 250 EC, 0.9 mg/l). SBI fungicides are assumed to interact with the detoxification mechanism of honeybees and should enhance the effects of neonicotinoids by inhibiting enzymes essential for insecticide degradation. Our study demonstrates that interactions of fungicides and neonicotinoids are more complex than assumed, because the SBI fungicide leveled the insecticide effect. These findings underline the importance for intensifying research on PPP combinations. © 2025 The Authors",NA,1018

When bioavailable, these chemicals pose a threat to living organisms and can induce oxidative stress (OS). In this article, attention is paid to OS and the physiological role of the antioxidant defense system. South African and international literature was reviewed to provide extensive evidence of pesticide-induced OS in non-target organisms, in vivo and in vitro. Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models. The authors conclude that it will be worthwhile for South Africa to include in vitro OS bioassays as part of a battery of tests to screen environmental matrices for biological effects.

It is worth noting that the presence of Fe3+ enhances the dispersibility of the NMs. The water dispersibility and photostability of RTD are significantly improved after encapsulation, and a stimulus response to laccase is achieved. Leaf-washing experiments confirm the enhanced adhesion of RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs to the surface of rice plant leaves compared to that of free RTD. Fluorescently labeled NMs exhibit bidirectional transport within rice plants, and RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs demonstrates better transport performance than RTD. In vitro and in vivo antifungal tests indicate that encapsulation by NMs significantly enhanced pesticide activity. Field trials demonstrate that NMs exhibited prolonged efficacy compared to RTD. Finally, the safety evaluation confirms the environmental friendliness of the NMs. This study provides valuable insight for optimizing and improving the utilization efficiency and biosafety of natural product–based pesticides. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",NA,1020

In the Republic of Korea, trunk injection of nematicides is the preferred method of control. In this study, the efficacy of 16 locally produced formulations of emamectin benzoate against the PWN are compared through determining their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials. Nematodes were treated with varying concentrations of the tested chemicals in multi-well culture plates, and rates of paralysis and mortality were determined after 24 h. Reproduction inhibition potential was tested by inoculating pre-treated nematodes onto Botrytis cinerea, and in pine twig cuttings. Despite the uniformity in the concentration of the active ingredient, efficacy was contrastingly different among formulations. The formulations evidently conformed to three distinct groups based on similarities in sublethal activity (group 1: LC95 of 0.00768-0.01443 mg/ ml; group 2: LC95 of 0.03202-0.07236 mg/ml, and group 3: LC95 of as high as 0.30643-0.40811 mg/ml). Nematode paralysis generally occurred at the application dose of 0.0134-0.1075 μg/ml, and there were significant differences in nematode paralysis rates among the products. Nematode reproduction was only evident at lower doses both on B. cinerea and pine twigs, albeit the variations among formulations. Group 1 formulations significantly reduced nematode reproduction even at a lower dose of 0.001075 µg/ml. The variations in efficacy might be attributed to differences in inert ingredients. Therefore, there is need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the large number of additives used in formulations. © 2023, Korean Society of Plant Pathology. All rights reserved.",NA,1021

In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess commercial methyl eugenol along with adulterants. For this purpose, commercial methyl eugenol was adulterated with different concentrations of xylene. The Raman spectral features of methyl eugenol and xylene in liquid formulations were examined, and Raman peaks were identified as associated with the methyl eugenol and adulterant. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLSR) have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the Raman spectral features. PCA was applied to differentiate Raman spectral data for various concentrations of methyl eugenol and xylene. Additionally, PLSR has been used to develop a predictive model to observe a quantitative relationship between various concentrations of adulterated methyl eugenol and their Raman spectral data sets. The root-mean-square errors of calibration and prediction were calculated using this model, and the results were found to be 1.90 and 3.86, respectively. The goodness of fit of the PLSR model is found to be 0.99.

One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations globally is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Though 2,4-D is used in aquatic ecosystems, no studies have investigated cellular, biochemical, and transcriptional effects or mechanisms of 2,4-D exposure on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) throughout juvenile development. Herein, we aim to evaluate the impacts of chronic ecologically relevant 2,4-D exposure on reproductive systems of fathead minnow. Juvenile fathead minnows were exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D in DMA4 herbicide under laboratory conditions in a flow through system. Male plasma testosterone concentrations, testicular and ovarian histology, and differential gene expression along the HPGL axis in three tissue types (brain, liver, and gonad) were assessed after a chronic 120 day exposure period. We observed significantly decreased plasma testosterone concentration in male fish exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.50, 2.00, and 4.00 mg/L) of 2,4-D. We observed a significant increase in ovarian severity grading and oocyte atresia in female fish exposed to 4.00 mg/L. Of differential expression analysis in fish exposed to 2.00 mg/L 2,4-D in DMA4, we identified significantly decreased expression of the steroid hormone receptors ESR1, ESR2b, and AR in males. Expression of male steroidogenic genes 3βHSD and 11βHSD2 along with expression of genes regulating steroid metabolism, SULT1st2 and CBR1l were increased. Altogether, these data suggest that 2,4-D could act as an endocrine disrupting chemical that alters expression of primary genes regulating hormone receptors, steroidogenesis, and steroid metabolism along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPGL) axis. The use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to the reproductive health of non-target aquatic species. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,1024

However, a lack of quality data impedes understanding of the problem and hampers the development of effective strategies for its management. To better understand the prevalence of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning (UAPP) in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica and the pesticides and practices involved, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 197 and 330 vegetable farmers in Trinidad and Jamaica, respectively. The findings from this study revealed a high incidence of self-reported health effects from occupational pesticide exposure, with 48 and 16% of respondents, respectively, experiencing symptoms of UAPP within the previous 12 months. Furthermore, the substantial proportion of UAPP incidents were associated with a few highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs), particularly lambda-cyhalothrin, acetamiprid, and profenofos in Jamaica, and alpha-cypermethrin, paraquat and lambda-cyhalothrin in Trinidad. Given the well-documented adverse effects of these chemicals on human health, the results of this study should be of significant concern to health authorities in Jamaica and Trinidad. This clearly indicates an urgent need for improved regulation and safer alternatives to the use of HHPs, as well as the promotion of alternatives. We provide policy recommendations and identify alternatives to HHPs for tropical vegetable production.

Because of the unique life history patterns of many amphibians with aquatic larvae that become terrestrial adults, amphibians bridge the aquatic and terrestrial habitats during their life cycles. Natural environmental factors (e.g., photoperiod, temperature) and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, agricultural and industrial chemicals) can influence metamorphosis and reproduction through disruption of the HPA, HPT, and/or HPG axes, thus affecting the opportunity to reproduce. Microplastic contamination (microbeads and microfibers) is also of concern. Disruption of sexual differentiation, metamorphosis, gonadal maturation, and reproductive behavior by human influences may be contributing to the worldwide decline and extinction of many amphibian species. Sufficient scientific information already is available that demonstrates anthropogenic factors are affecting the development, metamorphosis, and reproduction of amphibians, as well as other vertebrates and that mitigating actions should be taken now. © 2024 by Elsevier Inc.

While safeners are typically structurally similar to their co-formulated herbicides, they are classified as ""inert"" in the United States, meaning they are not held to the same regulatory standards as the herbicides. This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment.

Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate – Roundup®], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity. Taken altogether, the results highlight the importance of testing the impact of multiple agrochemicals (i.e. not just insecticides) through different routes of exposure in order to understand more comprehensively the potential risks for Apis and non-Apis bees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,1029

However, these emerging nanopesticides need a thorough evaluation compared to current formulations to determine whether their “nano” properties intensify toxicity for non-target organisms. This study assessed the lethal toxicity of three nanopesticides on Daphnia magna. The nanopesticides tested were tebuconazole loaded onto poly-ϵ-caprolactone, nanostructured lipid carriers, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles. Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers. The observed toxicity levels, from highest to lowest, were as follows: pure tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on nanostructured lipid carriers > commercial tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles > tebuconazole-loaded on poly-ϵ-caprolactone. The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay. Methodology/Principal findings Using standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifi-cally enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance.

Since the development of 2,4-D resistant transgenic crops, it has been described as one of the most widely distributed pollutants in the world, increasing concern about its environmental impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the antioxidant system response in animals exposed to 2,4-D by different routes of exposure. It focused on determining if tissue, phylogenetic group, and herbicide formulation would influence the antioxidant mechanisms. A careful literature search of Scopus, WoS, and Science Direct retrieved 6983, 24,098, and 20,616 articles, respectively. The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses. In summary, orally exposed animals exhibited a clear decrease in enzyme activities, transgenerational exposure elicited tissue-specific prompted biochemical reductions, and topical exposure induced increased responses, emphasizing the need for unbiased exploration of the effects of 2,4-D on biomarkers of oxidative stress while addressing publication bias in oral and topical datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,1036

Nevertheless, the effect of increased lipid peroxidation was not discernible following a 3-month recuperation period where animals were withdrawn from pesticide exposure post-weaning. Interestingly, toxic effects caused by prenatal exposure to the glyphosate NOAEL were present after the same 3-month recovery period. No statistically significant changes in the expression of genes linked with genotoxicity were observed. Our findings reinforce the importance of assessing the combined effects of chemical pollutants at doses that are asserted by regulatory agencies to be safe individually. © 2023",NA,1037

Therefore, designing a precise regulating strategy to balance the toxicity and bioactivity of MCs is urgently needed. Here, we prepared a series of pyraclostrobin-loaded MCs with different wall materials, particle sizes, core density and shell compactness using interfacial polymerization. The results showed that the MCs released more slowly in water with increasing particle sizes and capsule compactness, and they sunk more quickly with the increasing particle sizes and core density. Additionally, MCs with slower release speed was always accompanied with lower acute toxicity levels to zebrafish. When the release dynamics slowed down to the threshold dose on demand for disease control, facilitating settlement of MCs can further reduce toxicity within spatial and temporal dimensions. The poor accumulation of MCs with larger particle sizes or dense shell in gills was closely related to their efficient detoxification. Importantly, seven of the MCs samples possessed superior selectivity between bio-performance in controlling rice blast and toxicological hazard to fish compared to commercial formulations. The results provide a comprehensive guidance for developing an efficient and safe pesticide delivery system. © 2023",NA,1038

The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides in the mid–1990s and their subsequent widespread use appears to be the most likely major factor behind this sudden decline. Habitat loss and unfavorable climates (high temperatures, aridity, and winter storms) have also played important and ongoing roles. These factors kept overwintering populations stable but below 300,000 during 2001–2017. Late winter storm mortality and consequent poor spring reproduction drove winter populations to less than 30,000 butterflies during 2018–2019. Record high temperatures in California during the fall of 2020 appeared to prematurely terminate monarch migration, resulting in the lowest overwintering population (1899) ever recorded. Many migrants formed winter-breeding populations in urban areas. Normal seasonal temperatures in the autumns of 2021 and 2022 enabled overwintering populations to return to around the 300,000 level, characteristic of the previous two decades. Natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens) may be important regional or local drivers at times but they are a consistent and fundamental part of monarch ecology. Human interference (capture, rearing) likely has the least impact on monarch populations. The rearing of monarch caterpillars, particularly by children, is an important human link to nature that has positive ramifications for insect conservation beyond monarch butterflies and should be encouraged. © 2024 by the author.",NA,1039

Even though pesticides are seen as a good thing for protecting crops, there is one thing that mustn’t be forgotten the origin of the pesticide itself is a toxin compound that is dangerous if used irresponsibly. The main concern of this study is excessive use of pesticides may cause serious consequences to the ecosystem and environment through the accumulation of pesticide residue by irresponsible farmers. To minimize the effects of pesticide residues, the selection of the type of pesticide needs to be considered which type may not be harmful to the environment's health even though accumulation happens. Therefore, in this study, a fuzzy-based computational model assessor was built to measure the safety level of pesticides toward the environment. The fuzzy model was created with consideration of several parameters related to pesticide behaviors, its effects on beneficial organisms, and its persistence in the environment. The method used for this study includes literature reviewing, fuzzification, statistical approach, expert knowledge sharing, and quantitative analysis. The model created in this study can assist in a more accurate and realistic method of selecting better pesticide options that will be used by farmers. To ensure the validity of the model, verifying and validating the formula and pesticide result assessment were done with related literature articles. In this study, from 10 types of pesticides used as a sample, dodine, and iprodione pesticides are the best option for protecting crops with a safety level of 7.36, and abamectin, dimethoate, chorpyrifos, and methidathion are not safe options for farming use because of its potential of harming the environment. © 2024 The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology/Korea Society for Environmental Analysis.",NA,1040

Still, recent research has shown that these products can cause mortality or trigger sublethal effects in these insects. Roundup Transorb R® (RT) is one of the GLY-based formulations sold in Brazil. It is used in several crops, and studies are required on its toxicity to honey bees. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate, under laboratory conditions, the lethal and sublethal effects of RT for adult workers (foragers) of Africanized A. mellifera. For this, two bioassays were carried out with Africanized honey bees. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of five treatments (T0 - control, T25 – 25 % GLY, T50 – 50 % GLY, T75 – 75 % GLY, and T100 GLY – 100 % recommended dose). The bioassays were carried out as follows: (1) Acute oral and topical exposure, evaluating mortality, effects on flight capacity, vertical displacement, and locomotion (in the latter only for oral contamination), consisting of five repetitions and 10 honey bees per repetition; (2) Chronic exposure via the oral route and spraying, assessing mortality, for both contamination routes and damage to the midgut epithelium thickness when contaminated via the oral route, composed of five replicates and 20 honey bees per replicate. The results showed that chronic oral exposure to RT can increase honeybee mortality and damage the thickness of their midgut epithelium. In addition, when acutely exposed orally, the honey bees had reduced walking ability. RT did not affect the other evaluated parameters. Thus, it is concluded that the RT-formulated GLY can affect the survival, midgut morphology, and behavior of A. mellifera. © 2024 The Authors",NA,1043

We evaluated ecotoxicological endpoints, behavioral and developmental alterations, and the biochemical detoxifying, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress responses, covering a wide concentration range from environmental to high application levels. Both pyrethroid preparations displayed similar ecotoxicity (median lethal concentration of ~0.5 mg/L), with the lethal effect of Zero® being more pronounced than that of the active ingredient. Sublethal behavioral alterations in natatory activity were observed at 1000 times lower concentrations, indicating the ecological hazard of tadpole exposure to this pyrethroid at environmentally relevant concentrations. Biochemical endpoints in B. pulchella larvae showed significant responses to lambda-cyhalothrin in the ng/L range; these responses were different for the pure or the formulated product, and they were variable at higher concentrations. Principal components analysis confirmed the prevalence of biochemical responses as early endpoints at the lowest lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations; the Integrated Biomarker Response Index proportionally increased with pyrethroid concentration in a similar way for the pure and the formulated products.

Methods: We conducted a narrative review of occupational risk factors that can be considered to have ""consistent evidence for an association,""or where there is ""limited/inadequate evidence for an association""for 6 NCD groups: nonmalignant respiratory diseases; neurodegenerative diseases; cardiovascular/metabolic diseases; mental disorders; musculoskeletal diseases; and cancer. The assessment was done in expert sessions, primarily based on systematic reviews, supplemented with narrative reviews, reports, and original studies. Subsequently, knowledge gaps were identified, e.g. based on missing information on exposure-response relationships, gender differences, critical time-windows, interactions, and inadequate study quality. Results: We identified over 200 occupational exposures with consistent or limited/inadequate evidence for associations with one or more of 60+ NCDs. Various exposures were identified as possible risk factors for multiple outcomes. Examples are diesel engine exhaust and cadmium, with consistent evidence for lung cancer, but limited/inadequate evidence for other cancer sites, respiratory, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Other examples are physically heavy work, shift work, and decision latitude/job control. For associations with limited/inadequate evidence, new studies are needed to confirm the association. For risk factors with consistent evidence, improvements in study design, exposure assessment, and case definition could lead to a better understanding of the association and help inform health-based threshold levels. Conclusions: By providing an overview of knowledge gaps in the associations between occupational exposures and their health effects, our narrative review will help setting priorities in occupational health research. Future epidemiological studies should prioritize to include large sample sizes, assess exposures prior to disease onset, and quantify exposures. Potential sources of biases and confounding need to be identified and accounted for in both original studies and systematic reviews.  © 2024 The Author(s).",NA,1047

Spiromesifen, derived from spirocyclic tetronic acids, is widely used against agricultural pests and is crucial in resistance management due to its unique lipid synthesis inhibition. This study evaluates the insecticidal activity of spiromesifen against temephos-resistant Ae. aegypti populations, focusing on larval body weight, volume, biochemical composition, and adult female reproductive potential. Spiromesifen demonstrated effective larvicidal activity, significantly reducing adult emergence. Resistance to spiromesifen was not observed, with resistance ratios (RR50, RR90) ranging from 0.36- to 3.31-fold. Larvae exposed to LC50 showed significant reductions in body weight and volume, and reduced carbohydrate, lipid, and protein contents. Enhanced catalase activity and malondialdehyde levels indicated increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, highlighting its effects on lipid metabolism. Spiromesifen also exhibited sterilizing effects, significantly reducing fecundity and fertility in adult females, thereby impacting Ae. aegypti reproductive capacity. These findings highlight the potential of spiromesifen as a component of integrated vector management strategies, especially in regions with prevalent insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti, serving as an effective larvicide and impacting adult reproductive outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,1048

Although adjuvants are generally considered to be biologically inert, some adjuvants have exhibited toxicity and sublethal effects, including decreasing survival rates of next-generation queens. Honey bees have a highly developed olfactory system to detect and discriminate among social signals. To investigate the impact of pesticide-adjuvant combinations on honey bee signal perception, we performed electroantennography assays to assess alterations in their olfactory responsiveness to the brood ester pheromone (BEP), the volatile larval pheromone β-ocimene, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. These assays aimed to uncover potential mechanisms underlying changes in social behaviors and reduced brood survival after pesticide exposure. We found that combining the adjuvant Dyne-Amic with the fungicide Tilt (propiconazole) and the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole) synergistically enhanced olfactory responses to three concentrations of BEP and as well exerted dampening and compensatory effects on responses to 2-heptanone and β-ocimene, respectively. In contrast, exposure to adjuvant alone or the combination of fungicide and insecticide had no effect on olfactory responses to BEP at most concentrations but altered responses to β-ocimene and 2-heptanone. Exposure to Dyne-Amic, Altacor, and Tilt increased BEP signal amplitude, indicating potential changes in olfactory receptor sensitivity or sensilla permeability to odorants. Given that, in a previous study, next-generation queens raised by nurses exposed to the same treated pollen experienced reduced survival, these new findings highlight the potential disruption of social signaling in honey bees and its implications for colony reproductive success. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",NA,1049

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS: We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION: We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and “inert” ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of “inert” ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Owing to its widespread use, fipronil and its metabolites (fipronil sulfone, fipronil desulfinyl, and fipronil sulfide), termed FPM, can be frequently detected in drinking water and food. Fipronil can affect the thyroid function of animals, but the effects of FPM on the human thyroid remain unclear. We employed human thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3-1 cells to examine combined cytotoxic responses, thyroid-related functional proteins including the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), deiodinases I-III (DIO I-III), and the nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway induced by FPM of 1-1000-fold concentrations detected in school drinking water collected from a heavily contaminated area of the Huai River Basin. Thyroid-disrupting effects of FPM were evaluated by examining biomarkers of oxidative stress and thyroid function and tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels secreted by Nthy-ori 3-1 cells after FPM treatment. FPM activated the expression of NRF2, HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1), TPO, DIO I, and DIO II but inhibited NIS expression and increased the T4 level of thyrocytes, indicating that FPM can disrupt the function of human thyrocytes through oxidative pathways. Given the adverse impact of low FPM concentrations on human thyrocytes, supportive evidence from rodent studies, and the critical importance of thyroid hormones on development, the effects of FPM on the neurodevelopment and growth of children warrant priority attention. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,1051

Both active ingredients and co-formulants can cause human and environmental toxicity. However, under European Union and United States law, the full details of the co-formulant composition are kept secret from the public and researchers. Only the producer and regulators know the full details. Here I argue that legislators should end ‘co-formulant secrecy’ and require all the ingredients in a pesticide be listed openly, including their concentrations. To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition. Further, patents are already utilised, so secrecy adds no additional benefit to industry. I argue that co-formulant secrecy only serves to stifle and limit the ability of independent scientists to conduct research. © 2024 The Authors",NA,1052

This lack of exposure specificity could lead to results that fail to detect an association.

We conducted a meta-analysis following the PRISMA checklist to identify PPP exposure determinants used in occupational studies and identified exposure determinants that best characterized agricultural exposures to PPPs. Out of 1436 studies identified, 71 were included. The exposure determinants identified were active ingredients, chemical classes, types of PPP, crops, tasks, frequencies, duration, lifetime exposure days, and intensity-weighted exposure days. Only six over 17 associations between exposure determinants and health outcomes were found with moderate quality of evidence. Overall, epidemiological studies had difficulty defining relevant determinants to characterize PPP exposures for agricultural workers. We recommend that a standardized list of determinants for PPP exposures in occupational exposure studies should include information on formulations, intensity, duration, and frequency of PPP exposure. Harmonized data collection on exposure and health outcomes are required as well as standard units for each exposure determinant. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,1053

This study observed the sublethal effects of two pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin (within commercially available formulations), on post-larval stage IV American lobster (Homarus americanus) using growth parameters and metabolic rate as indicators. Observed effects on growth parameters were a decrease in size increment and specific growth rate as well as an increase in intermolt period in stage IV lobsters exposed to 100 μg/kg permethrin. No significant differences were found for intermolt period, size increment, or specific growth rate in deltamethrin-exposed stage IV lobsters. Metabolic rates were not significantly different between deltamethrin-exposed and control lobsters, however, this sublethal effect warrants further investigation.

Obtaining information regarding the fate of this a.i. in environmental matrices and its ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms is essential for the risk assessment of the herbicide. In this study, the effects of Merlin Flexx- and Merlin WG75 formulated isoxaflutole-based herbicide products and two selected additives (cyprosulfamide safener and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one antimicrobial agent) were investigated on Raphidocelis subcapitata in growth inhibition assays. In ecotoxicological tests, two conventional (optical density and chlorophyll-a content) and two induced fluorescence-based (Fv*/Fp: efficiency of the photosystem PSII and Rfd* changes in the observed ratio of fluorescence decrease) endpoints were determined by UV-spectrophotometer and by our FluoroMeter Module, respectively. Furthermore, dissipation of isoxaflutole alone and in its formulated products was examined by an HPLC-UV method. In ecotoxicological assays, the fluorescence-based Rfd* was observed as the most sensitive endpoint. In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole–safener–antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 ± 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i. (EC50 = 0.02 ± 0.00 mg/L). The Merlin Flexx formulation (EC50 = 27.04 ± 1.41 mg/L) was found to be approximately 50-fold less toxic than Merlin WG75, which can be explained by the different chemical characteristics and quantity of additives in them. The additives influenced the dissipation of the a.i. in Z8 medium, as the DT50 value decreased by approximately 1.2- and 3.5-fold under light and dark conditions, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.",NA,1056

To investigate these effects while considering plant competition, we conducted a completely randomised pot experiment. We grew four temperate grassland species – Achillea ptarmica, Agrostis capillaris, Dianthus deltoides, and Plantago lanceolata – separately in pots, with soil treated with formulated moxidectin at three concentration levels (0.1, 1, 5 μg g−1) or left untreated (control). In half of the pots, we added the dominant grass species Poa pratensis as a competitor. Over a full growth period in a greenhouse, we measured three morphological traits: above-ground plant biomass (APB), specific leaf area (SLA), and intact leaf area (ILA). Moxidectin concentrations in the above-ground plant parts and soil were analysed using HPLC. Results showed that moxidectin was absorbed by the roots and transported to the above-ground plant parts. At the highest concentration (5 μg g−1), APB and ILA were reduced by 14.4 % and 19.8 %, respectively, compared to controls, while SLA increased by 12.2 %. Anthelmintic effects varied with competition; for APB, significant effects were noted only in the absence of competition for three out of four species. The highest increases in SLA and reductions in ILA at 5 μg g−1 occurred without competition in one and three species, respectively. These findings suggest that soil contamination by anthelmintic residues can negatively affect the growth and fitness of grassland plants, particularly in low-competition areas, such as open soil patches, which serve as protective microsites for plant recruitment. © 2025 The Authors",NA,1057

Dicamba easily migrates to deep soil, which is anoxic; however, the anaerobic catabolism of dicamba in paddy soil is still unknown. In this study, an anaerobic dicamba-degrading consortium was enriched from deep paddy soil. The consortium completely degraded 0.83 mM dicamba within 7 days. Five metabolites were identified, one of which is a new metabolite, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and a novel anaerobic dicamba degradation pathway was proposed. 2.5 mM dicamba, 1.5-2.0% NaCl, and 20 mM electron acceptors Na2SO4, NaNO3, and FeCl3, and 0.5 mM or more of metabolites 3-CP and 2,5-DCP strongly inhibited the degradation efficiency.

These regulations are among the most stringent in the world, however they have been the subject of criticisms especially because of the decline in biodiversity. The objectives of this work were to review (1) the functioning and actors involved in the PPP framework processes, (2) the construction of the environmental risk assessment focused on biodiversity, and (3) the suggested ways to respond to the identified limits. Both literature from social sciences and ecotoxicology were examined. Despite the protective nature of the European regulation on PPPs, the very imperfect consideration of biodiversity in the evaluation process was underlined. The main limits are the multiplicity of applicable rules, the routinization of the evaluation procedures, the lack of consideration of social data, and the lack of independence of the evaluation. Strengths of the regulation are the decision to integrate a systemic approach in the evaluation of PPPs, the development of modeling tools, and the phytopharmacovigilance systems. The avenues for improvement concern the realism of the risk assessment (species used, cocktail effects…), a greater transparency and independence in the conduct of evaluations, and the opening of the evaluation and decision-making processes to actors such as beekeepers or NGOs. Truly interdisciplinary reflections crossing the functioning of the living world, its alteration by PPPs, and how these elements question the users of PPPs would allow to specify social actions, public policies, and their regulation to better protect biodiversity.

Pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represents a threat to non-target organisms, with various damages already reported in different species. However, there is controversy in studies on atrazine. The question of whether atrazine increases animal mortality is not yet clearly resolved. In this context, this study aimed to carry out a meta-analytic review, focusing on studies on environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine to evaluate its lethal effects on various animal species. We identified and analyzed 107 datasets through a selection process that used the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. A significant increase in the mortality rate of animals exposed to environmental concentrations of atrazine was observed. Nematodes, amphibians, molluscs, insects, and fish showed increased mortality after exposure to atrazine. Animals in the larval and juvenile stages showed greater susceptibility when exposed to different concentrations of atrazine. Furthermore, both commercial and pure formulations resulted in high mortality rates for exposed animals. Atrazine and other pesticides had a synergistic effect, increasing the risk of mortality in animals. There are still many gaps to be filled, and this study can serve as a basis for future regulations involving atrazine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,1061

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al.

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing pesticide risks. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,1063

Tadpoles were exposed to concentrations of ABH (2, 9.33, 10.40, 47.21, and 240 μg L−1) and GBH (65, 144, 280, 500, and 1000 μg L−1), as well as a mixture ABH + GBH, for 7 days. Although survival and swimming activity were not significantly affected by herbicide exposure, tadpoles in all treatments showed damage to the mouth and intestine, changes in size and mass, and an increase in the frequency of micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities. Despite differences in some variables analyzed, it is not possible to definitively state that there is a difference in the toxicity of these two herbicides, as both caused morphological damage and were cyto-genotoxic.

The mixture of the pesticides presented synergistic effects on the mortality of N. iheringi. Post-exposure tests showed no difference between the treatments and the control on the mortality and on the feeding rate for 4 h.

Thus, this study aimed to increase knowledge on PAR's potential environmental impacts, assessing the effects of commercial formulation (PAR-c) and active ingredient (PAR-a) on fish. Therefore, the short-term exposure effects of PAR-c and PAR-a were assessed on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae to determine the most toxic formulation [through median lethal (LC50) and effective concentrations (EC50)]. PAR-c and PAR-a induced morphological abnormalities (scoliosis) in a dose-dependent manner from 96 hours post-fertilization onwards, suggesting the involvement of a fully functional biotransformation system. As PAR-c exhibited higher toxicity, it was selected to be tested in the subsequent stage (juvenile stage), which was more sensitive (lower LC50). PAR-c significantly decreased fish swimming activity and disrupted fish stress response. Overall, the results highlight the ability of PAR-c to adversely affect fish swimming performance, an effect that persisted even after exposure ceases (21-day depuration), suggesting that PAR-c may impair individual fitness. © 2023 The Authors",NA,1067

They are emitted into the atmosphere via spraying and post-application volatilization, but their heterogeneous degradation kinetics toward OH radicals has not been well characterized. Therefore, the degradation rates of particle-associated PMM and PM with OH radicals were studied under different conditions including particle type, relatively humidity (RH), and temperature. The experimental results indicated that the degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on hydrophilic SiO2 particles were faster than those adsorbed on hydrophobic SiO2 particles, suggesting that heterogeneous kinetics was affected by surface properties of SiO2 particles. The degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on these two kinds of SiO2 particles under experimental conditions ranged from (10.8 ± 0.7) × 10−12 and (6.1 ± 0.8) × 10−12 to (28.0 ± 1.7) × 10−12 and (13.5 ± 1.2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. Additionally, these rate constants showed a negative relationship with increasing RH level (20−80%) while a positive relationship with elevating temperature (5−35 °C). Arrhenius expressions for their heterogeneous degradation and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. According to the obtained degradation rates, the atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM toward OH radicals were in the ranges of 9.9–25.8 and 20.7−46.1 h, respectively, suggesting that OH-initiated heterogeneous degradation might be an important pathway during their atmospheric transformation processes. The experimental kinetic data obtained in this work are in favor of improving the understandings of atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM, and also highlight that the environmental factors including particle type, RH, and temperature should be seriously taken into account for determining the atmospheric lifetimes of pesticides. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",NA,1068

Despite their advantages in crop production and disease management, the use of pesticides poses significant hazards to the environment and public health. Pesticide elements have now perpetually entered our atmosphere and subsequently contaminated water, food, and soil, leading to health threats ranging from acute to chronic toxicities. Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The toxicity of a pesticide formulation may depend on the specific active ingredient and the presence of synergistic or inert compounds that can enhance or modify its toxicity.

Characterization results demonstrated that the nanocapsules prepared under optimal conditions exhibited uniform sizes (200–400 nm) and high encapsulation efficiency (>90 %). Photodegradation experiments revealed a significant increase of half-lives (7.21–55.57 times) under UV irradiation for the different pesticide nanocapsules. Furthermore, the pesticide nanocapsules demonstrated a high biological activity and excellent physicochemical properties, including pH-responsive release, maximum retention, and rain erosion resistance. The results of the mechanistic studies on the increased biological activity indicated that the nanocapsules could be adsorbed on the surface of target pathogenic cells and then released CIN and PLL, destroying the integrity of the cell membrane, and synergistically and effectively eradicating the pathogen with pesticide. Additionally, nanocapsules exhibited lower toxicity to zebrafish and genetic toxicity to Vicia faba than pesticide technical.

Atrazine (ATZ) is a triazine herbicide widely used worldwide, and its ecotoxicity to soil microorganisms has been widely studied. However, previous studies have focused on investigating the ecotoxicity of ATZ active ingredients under laboratory conditions. The damage caused by ATZ formulations to soil health in the actual field environment cannot be ignored. Herein, the toxicity of ATZ formulations (1140 and 1710 g hm−2) in maize fields after 1, 28, and 72 d of exposure was investigated in terms of soil microbial abundance, community structure, soil enzyme activities, functional gene abundance, and ATZ residues. The results showed that ATZ disturbed the microbial functions that maintain soil health by disturbing soil nutrient and carbon cycling as well as enhancing pollution degradation. The promotion of both urease activity and AOB-amoA gene abundance indicated that ATZ accelerated the loss of nitrogen from soil, which was detrimental to soil nitrogen cycling. The abundances of the Pontibacter genus and the cbbLG gene were inhibited, indicating that the ability of soil carbon dioxide fixation was hindered. The abundance of Lysobacter, which helps to degrade pollutants, increased. The integrated biomarker response indicated that the comprehensive toxicity of ATZ to soil microorganisms increased with dose. Additionally, the DT50 of ATZ in agricultural soil was 5.4–5.7 d, and the residual level of ATZ in crop grains was in line with the maximum residue limit recommended by the European Union and China.

The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations. It is concluded that the commercial formulations Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC® and their mixtures cause significant alterations in the detoxification metabolism of exposed organisms and induce oxidative stress in fish. © 2024",NA,1073

Trunk injection of nematicides is currently the most preferred method of control. This study aimed to evaluate the potency of the commonly used formulations of abamectin against B. xylophilus. Twenty-one formulations of abamectin were evaluated by comparing their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials against B. xylophilus. Nematodes were treated with diluted formulation concentrations in multi-well culture plates. And, populations preexposed to pre-determined concentrations of the formulations were inoculated onto Botrytis cinerea culture, and in pine twig cuttings. Potency was contrastingly different among formulations, with LC95 of 0.00285 and 0.39462 mg/ml for the most, and the least potent formulation, respectively. Paralysis generally occurred at an application dose of 0.06 μg/ ml or higher, and formulations with high sublethal toxicities caused significant paralysis levels at the tested doses, albeit the variations. Nematode reproduction was evident at lower doses of 0.00053-0.0006 μg/ml both on Botrytis cinerea and pine twigs, with significant variations among formulations. Thus, the study highlighted the inconsistencies in the potency of similar product formulations with the same active ingredient concentration against the target organism, and the need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the additives used in formulations. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology.",NA,1074

When bioavailable, these chemicals pose a threat to living organisms and can induce oxidative stress (OS). In this article, attention is paid to OS and the physiological role of the antioxidant defense system. South African and international literature was reviewed to provide extensive evidence of pesticide-induced OS in non-target organisms, in vivo and in vitro. Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models. The authors conclude that it will be worthwhile for South Africa to include in vitro OS bioassays as part of a battery of tests to screen environmental matrices for biological effects.

Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) bioassays were selected to test genotoxicity. Neutral red uptake (NRU), succinic dehydrogenase activity (MTT) and apoptogenic induction were employed for estimating cytotoxicity. Both compounds were analysed within a concentration range of 0.1–100 µg/mL. Only LCT produced a significant augment in the frequency of micronuclei (MNs) when the cultures were exposed to highest concentrations of 10 and 100 µg LCT/mL. A noticeable decrease in NDI was observed for cultures treated with LCT at 10 and 100 µg/mL. Karate® induced the inhibition of both the proportion of viable cells and succinic dehydrogenase activity and triggered apoptosis 24 h of exposition. Whilst an increased GDI in CHO-K1 cells was observed in the treatments with 1–100 µg Karate®/mL, the GDI was not modified in the treatments employing LCT at equivalent doses. SCGE showed that Karate® was more prone to induce genotoxic effects than LCT. Only 50 µg/mL of Karate® was able to increase apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the genomic instability and cytotoxic effects induced by this pyrethroid insecticide, confirming that LCT exposure can result in a severe drawback for the ecological equilibrium of the environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,1077

This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value. The commercial formulation composed of deltamethrin+imidacloprid followed the concentration addition model (when compared with parameters retrieved from individual a.i.) and the other three mixtures evaluated (I: chlorothalonil-propineb-deltamethrin+imidacloprid; II: chlorothalonil-propineb-ziram-thiocyclam; III: chlorothalonil-propineb-chlorpyrifos) produced an antagonistic effect on D. magna, thus suggesting less acute toxicity than their individual components. Subsequent chronic studies showed that one of the most toxic mixtures (II) negatively affected D. magna reproduction at sublethal concentrations indicating that this mixture poses a risk to this species if these pesticides co-exist in freshwater systems. These findings provide useful data to better estimate the impact of real agricultural practices related to the use of agrochemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,1078

Herein, MSN loaded with indoxacarb (IN) were successfully prepared using the hard template method. Dopamine (DA) and α-cyclohexapentylose (α-CD) were encapsulated around the MSN surface to obtain pH and enzyme dual-response nanoparticles (IN@MSN@PDA@α-CD). The prepared nanoparticles showed a spherical core-shell structure with a loading content of 22.5 %, and the polymer coating covering the surface of the nanoparticles effectively protected IN from photolysis. Moreover, different biostimuli associated with Spodoptera frugiperda can trigger the release of IN from nanoparticles. Compared with the commercial emulsifiable concentrate (14.93 mg L−1), IN@MSN@PDA@α-CD (8.89 mg L−1) extended the effective duration of IN against Spodoptera frugiperda, and considerably decreased the toxicity of IN to Eisenia fetida, zebrafish and human BEAS-2B cells.

In the Republic of Korea, trunk injection of nematicides is the preferred method of control. In this study, the efficacy of 16 locally produced formulations of emamectin benzoate against the PWN are compared through determining their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials. Nematodes were treated with varying concentrations of the tested chemicals in multi-well culture plates, and rates of paralysis and mortality were determined after 24 h. Reproduction inhibition potential was tested by inoculating pre-treated nematodes onto Botrytis cinerea, and in pine twig cuttings. Despite the uniformity in the concentration of the active ingredient, efficacy was contrastingly different among formulations. The formulations evidently conformed to three distinct groups based on similarities in sublethal activity (group 1: LC95 of 0.00768-0.01443 mg/ ml; group 2: LC95 of 0.03202-0.07236 mg/ml, and group 3: LC95 of as high as 0.30643-0.40811 mg/ml). Nematode paralysis generally occurred at the application dose of 0.0134-0.1075 μg/ml, and there were significant differences in nematode paralysis rates among the products. Nematode reproduction was only evident at lower doses both on B. cinerea and pine twigs, albeit the variations among formulations. Group 1 formulations significantly reduced nematode reproduction even at a lower dose of 0.001075 µg/ml. The variations in efficacy might be attributed to differences in inert ingredients.

Concentrations between 1 and 5000 μg L−1 were chosen for acute exposures and 0.1 and 1 μg L−1 for the sub-chronic one. After 14 days biochemical parameters, viability and sub-populations of hemocytes, reproductive parameters, embryotoxicity and offspring' survival were studied. Egg masses laid between day 12 and 14 were separated to continue the exposure and the embryos were examined daily. Offspring' survival and morphological changes were registered for 14 days after hatching. 48 h-LC50, NOEC and LOEC were similar between CF and AI, however the CF caused more sub-lethal effects. CF but not the AI decreased carboxylesterases, catalase and the proportion of hyalinocytes with respect to the total hemocytes, and increased superoxide dismutase and the % of granulocytes with pseudopods. Also CF caused embryotoxicity probably due to the increase of embryos' membrane permeability. Acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, hemocytes sub-populations, the time and rate of hatching and juveniles' survival were the most sensitive biomarkers.

As a major disease of oil palm, basal stem rot (BSR) caused by Ganoderma boninense always be a top concern of oil palm farmers. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of combining allicin with hesperidin and rutin on antifungal activity against G. boninense through the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index.

The result showed that a combination of allicin with hesperidin or rutin was the additive interaction that lowers the concentration of each compound with similar inhibition rate of G. boninense in vitro. Combining allicin with rutin was considered better than hesperidin due to the higher inhibition rate of G. boninense.

While anthelmintic effects on non-target animals, such as dung-dwelling insects, are well studied, effects on seed germination are largely unknown. Seeds can come into contact with anthelmintics either during passage through the gastro-intestinal tract of grazing animals or when anthelmintics are excreted with their dung into the environment, which may result in changed germination patterns. We used four commonly applied macrocyclic lactones to assess their effects on germination: moxidectin, ivermectin, abamectin and doramectin as pure substances; moxidectin and ivermectin also in formulated form. We tested these pharmaceuticals on 17 different temperate grassland species from five plant families. Seeds were exposed to three concentrations of macrocyclic lactones (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg·l−1) under controlled conditions, and germination was assessed over a 6-week period. From these data, we calculated germination percentage, mean germination time and germination synchrony. Most of the tested species were significantly affected in germination percentage and/or mean germination time by at least one of the tested pharmaceuticals, with formulated moxidectin having the largest impact. In general, the effects found were species- and pharmaceutical-specific. While formulated substances generally reduced germination percentage and increased mean germination time, pure substances increased germination percentage. Synchrony showed less clear patterns in all pharmaceuticals. Although effect size and sign varied between species, our study shows that non-target effects of macrocyclic lactones commonly occur in terrestrial plants.

Two French Mediterranean lagoons (Thau and Or) were monitored for a range of 68 pesticides continuously over a period of a year (2015–16). The findings revealed mixtures of dissolved pesticides with varying composition and levels over the year. The Or site contained more pesticides than Thau site (37 vs 28 different substances), at higher concentrations (0.1–58.6 ng.L−1 at Or vs <0.1–9.9 at Thau) and with overall higher detection frequencies. All samples showed a potential chronic toxicity risk, depending on the composition and concentrations of co-occurring pesticides. In 74 % of the samples, this pesticide risk was driven by a few single substances (ametryn, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorotoluron, irgarol, diuron and metolachlor) and certain transformation products (e.g. DPMU and metolachlor OA/ESA). Individually, these were a threat for the three taxa studied (phytoplankton, crustaceans and fish). Yet even a drastic reduction of these drivers alone (up to 5 % of their current concentration) would not eliminate the toxicity risks in 56 % of the Or Lagoon samples, due to pesticide mixtures. The two CA-based approaches used to assess the combined effect of these mixtures, determined chronic potential negative impacts for both lagoons, while no acute risk was highlighted. This risk was seasonal, indicating the importance of monitoring in key periods (summer, winter and spring) to get a more realistic picture of the pesticide threat in lagoon waters. These findings suggest that it is crucial to review the current EU Water Framework Directive's risk-assessment method, as it may incorrectly determine pesticide risk in lagoons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",NA,1089

The spread of impermeable surfaces in urban coastal areas increases runoff, carrying pollutants that degrade surface water quality and impact the stress responses of coastal fauna. This study investigated oxidative stress and gonad health in male and female Callinectes amnicola (blue crabs) from urban and suburban regions of Lagos Lagoon. Gonadal damage in the crabs was linked to estrogenic metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) and antioxidant responses (MDA, GSH, GPx, CAT, and SOD). Urban male crabs showed higher oxidative stress, with elevated MDA and lower GSH and CAT levels, alongside regressive gonadal changes due to increased Pb, Cd, and Zn exposure. Suburban crabs, however, displayed more intersex conditions (ovotestes) correlated with elevated Cu levels in lagoon sediment. These results highlight severe testicular disruption in urban males and ovarian dysgerminomas in suburban females, indicating a sex-specific impact of pollution on reproductive health. The study identifies two primary reproductive toxicity risks: (1) male testicular damage and regressive lesions in urban crabs, caused by increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and (2) female endocrine disruption, with ovotestes in suburban populations potentially leading to nonviable follicles.

In this study the impact of crop type (spring wheat and corn) and cultivation intensity on the community of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in the forest-steppe of Western Siberia was investigated. A total of 39 species from 15 genera were collected. Ground beetles' community was characterized by a high evenness of species distribution across the agroecosystems. The average Jaccard's similarity index for species presence/absence was 65%, and for abundance it was 54%. The significant difference in the distribution of predatory and mixophytophages ground beetles in wheat crops (U test, P < 0.05) can be justified by the constant suppression of the weed component and the use of insecticides that lead to the dominance of the predators. Fauna of wheat crops was more diverse than that in corn (Margalef index, U test, P < 0.05). No significant differences in biological diversity indexes, except for the Simpson dominance index (U test, P < 0.05, wheat), were found in ground beetle communities in crops at different levels of intensification. A certain differentiation of predatory species was caused by the selective occurrence of the litter-soil species, especially abundant in the row-crop. The specificity of the ground beetle community of corn crops may have been caused by repeated inter-row tillage, which influenced the increase in porosity and topsoil relief and contributed to the creation of favorable microclimatic conditions. In general, the applied level of agrotechnological intensification had no significant effect on the species composition and ecological structure of beetle communities in agrolandscapes. The use of bioindicators made it possible to assess the environmental sustainability of the agricultural environment and also creates the prerequisites for the development of ecologically directed correction of agrotechnological operations in agroecosystem management. © 2023",NA,1091

Nanopesticide research, introduced relatively recently, is an emerging field that can be defined as application of nanotechnology for crop protection. Nanopesticides have been proven to be more effective in reducing pest populations and plant infestation levels than bulk chemical pesticides.Some of the advantages that nanopesticide formulations present are increased solubility of water-insoluble active ingredients, increased formulation stability, elimination of toxic organic solvents when compared to conventional pesticides, the ability to release active ingredients gradually, enhanced stability to prevent early degradation, increased mobility and higher pesticidal activity due to smaller particle size, and a larger surface area that may lengthen their shelf life. Furthermore, the nanopesticides we're interested in are synthesized using plant-based substances, making them promising alternatives to traditional pest control chemicals. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) play an important role in human nutrition due to their high nutritional value. However, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, harmful insect species and mites can limit and reduce their production. In the current paper, we present the framework on which plant based nanopesticide technology is based, as well as the various techniques for determining nanoparticle properties. We highlight the potential for several medicinal and aromatic plants from the Khenifra region in Morocco to be used in the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles. We also reviewed the use of metal nanoparticles in crop protection, emphasizing the control of green bean’s pests and disease, while compiling numerous research that demonstrate their effectiveness. After comparing plant-based nanopesticides to chemical pesticides used to treat green beans in Morocco, it is clear that they have enormous potential for treating pests and diseases with fewer negative effects on the environment and human health. © Articles by the authors;.",NA,1092

Nanoformulations of pesticides are being developed as potential alternatives due to their beneficial properties, including enhanced solubility, targeted delivery to the site of action, improved stability and efficacy and reduced non-target effects. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment is necessary for these emerging nanopesticides compared to existing formulations, aiming to ascertain whether their ""nano"" characteristics exacerbate toxicity for non-target organisms. This study investigated the toxicity of tebuconazole (TBZ) in different formulations, including nanoformulations (poly-ε-caprolactone [PCL] and nanostructured lipid carrier [NLC] loaded with TBZ), as well as a commercial formulation, on the reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in both aqueous and soil matrices. Additionally, the impact of the correspondent nanocarriers without TBZ on C. elegans was examined. In water, TBZ in the form of nano and commercial formulations exhibited higher toxicity on the nematodes' reproduction than the TBZ (a.s.) attributable to higher freely dissolved concentrations of TBZ, which resulted in a toxicity order, ranging from the most to the least toxic as follows: NLC-TBZ > PCL-TBZ > commercial formulation > TBZ (a.s.). For NLC-TBZ, the excess toxicity could be clearly explained by combined toxicity of TBZ (a.s.) and nanocarriers, with the effect addition of the separate single compounds matching the observed effects of the nanoformulation. For PCL-TBZ, effects were stronger than expected from the effect addition of TBZ (a.s.) and PCL nanocarriers, potentially due to enhanced bioavailability of encapsulated TBZ in the gut of the nematodes. In soil, NLC with and without loaded TBZ showed higher toxicity than other tested compounds, while PCL nanocarriers without TBZ did not exhibit negative effects on the reproduction of C. elegans. Microcosm experiment, where long-term effects on native soil nematode fauna were tested, confirmed that TBZ-nanoformulations act via combined toxic effects of TBZ and nanocarriers. These findings contribute valuable insights to understanding nanopesticides' ecotoxicity and underscore the need for harmonized regulatory assessments to evaluate these novel formulations adequately. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,1093

Model application and evaluation,2023,Ecological Modelling,484,NA,NA,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110472,"Some artificial ponds (APs) are designed to collect part of the agricultural water fluxes and dissipate pesticide contamination through a synergy of physicochemical processes. APs act as buffer zones and mitigate pesticide transfer of farm plots to natural water resources. As part of a two-paper series, this paper addresses the application and validation of the PESTIPOND model. PESTIPOND is a process-based model developed to predict pesticides' behavior and distribution in APs located in drained agricultural catchments. Paper I (Bahi et al., 2023a) describes the development and sensitivity analysis of the model. PESTIPOND was applied on the Rampillon AP to characterize the fate of seven different pesticides and five monitoring periods while considering the key transfer and transformation processes. The model was assessed through various methods against the observed data in simulating pesticide dynamics. The statistical and graphical evaluation of PESTIPOND reflected a good performance except for boscalid. The sensitivity analysis and application of the model evidenced that adsorption-desorption and biotransformation in the pond water are major processes behind pesticide dissipation. Hydrophobic and lowly mobile pesticides are more likely to be bio-transformed at the water-sediment interface. This work highlights the link between the hydraulic residential time (HRT), temperature, and APs' efficiency in minimizing pesticide transfer into the environment. The model predicted that the actual efficiency of the AP covering 0.15% of the drained catchment would double if the pond's surface area covered at least 1% of the catchment. Moreover, the model's predictions evidenced that a temperature rise of 10 °C will increase the dissipation of pesticides by only 8%. PESTIPOND provides key elements that are useful to design and manage ponds with optimal efficiency. Hence, these APs can be complementary solutions to pesticide use regulation to reduce the transfer of agricultural contamination into freshwater resources. © 2023",NA,1094

Mortality, hatching rate, spontaneous contraction, heartbeat, morphological changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), skeletal development, and locomotor behavior of zebrafish were analyzed. Embryos were exposed to imidacloprid (IMI) and β-cyfluthrin (β-CYF) in the following ratios: 0.001 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.000125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C1); 0.01 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.00125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C2); 0.1 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.0125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C3); 1.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C4); 10.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 1.25 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C5) for 144 h. The results showed a mortality of 50 % of organisms in the C5 concentration. Embryos exposed to C1 and C3 showed tachycardia and hatched early compared to the negative control, indicating cardiotoxic and embryotoxic effects. The two highest concentrations tested (C4 and C5) induced evident morphological changes (yolk sac and pericardial edema, and spine alterations), and skeletal toxicity (absence of cartilage and bone formation), along with decreased larval swimming behavior. Also, the formulated insecticide (C1) increased ROS levels in zebrafish larvae. Results showed that the formulated insecticide containing IMI and β-CYF induces several toxic effects on developing zebrafish, indicating its environmental risk to aquatic organisms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",NA,1095

This knowledge has prompted studies on its effects on non-target organisms, revealing significant alterations to liver structure and function. In this review, we evaluated the literature on the hepatotoxicity of 2,4-D, focusing on morphological damages, toxicity biomarkers and affected liver functions. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus and 83 articles were selected after curation. Among these studies, 72% used in vivo models and 30% used in vitro models. Additionally, 48% used the active ingredient, and 35% used commercial formulations in exposure experiments. The most affected biomarkers were related to a decrease in antioxidant capacity through alterations in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and the levels of malondialdehyde. Changes in energy metabolism, lipids, liver function, and xenobiotic metabolism were also identified. Furthermore, studies about the effects of 2,4-D in mixtures with other pesticides were found, as well as hepatoprotection trials. The reviewed data indicate the essential role of reduction in antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in 2,4-D-induced hepatotoxicity.

Quantifying the associated health risk highlights the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into inhalation exposure assessments rather than using the total inhaled concentration of airborne pesticides. In this study, we measured the inhalation unit exposure (UE) of three typical pesticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid) during application and post-application drift at the recommended application dosage. The UE values were found to be 1.74–424.37 ng/m3 and 0.07–1.40 ng/m3, respectively, with marked variation between different spraying nozzles and formulations. For the inhalation exposure assessment, an in vitro method was developed to determine the inhalation bioaccessibility of lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid and its applicability was validated based on in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) analysis. Their conservative inhalation bioaccessibility values estimates were 46.09 %, 67.12 %, and 40.31 %, respectively. The calculated average daily dose values of the analyzed pesticides in both single and mixed formulations ranged from 8.03 × 10−8 to 4.35 × 10−5 mg/kg·day based on the bioaccessible UE, corresponding to 22.99–67.11 % of the total exposure.

Many of these pesticides enter ponds, rivers, and reservoirs through runoff from agricultural fields and raise concerns for fish and other aquatic organisms. The purpose of this review is to explore different approaches used to evaluate pesticide toxicity in fish, ranging from traditional to cutting-edge techniques, for a better understanding of the environmental implications of pesticide pollution. The present article highlights specific endpoints to consider, the role of pesticide formulation, interactions of pesticide mixtures, ambient hydrological and biological factors, and the use of biomarkers, among others. In modern aquatic toxicology, one reliable method for assessing fish health and stress responses is the analysis of multiple biomarkers in fish exposed to pesticides. A comprehensive approach is used to aggregate all the detected biomarker responses into a single “Integrated Biomarker Response” (IBR) stress score. There is a view that integrating multiple biomarker responses can improve the ecological relevance of biomarkers. Moreover, the analysis of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) is a helpful method to interpret the dose-response effects of toxicants.

In standardised germination experiments, we assessed three germination variables (germination percentage, mean germination time, synchrony of germination) and one post-germination variable (seedling root length) under different environmentally realistic antibiotic concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg l−1 and a water control). While the germination variables were only irregularly and weakly affected by both antibiotics, seedling root length was strongly reduced by tetracycline, but not by sulfamethazine. Among the test species, D. glomerata was most sensitive to tetracycline with the average root length reduced up to 81 % in the 10 mg l−1 treatment. Its germination behaviour, however, was almost insensitive to the two antibiotics. Mixture effects were only shown in relation to the germination of single species, where the binary mixture produced effects but not the two single antibiotics or, conversely, effects of single antibiotics were lost in the mixture.

Unfortunately, in the field, honey bees are exposed to mixtures of compounds rather than single substances. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a commercial fungicide and a commercial herbicide, both individually and in combination, on honey bees. Mortality assays, biomarkers and learning and memory tests were performed, and the results were integrated to assess the toxicological status of honey bees. Neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities), detoxification and metabolic processes (glutathione S-transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities), immune system function (lysozyme activity and haemocytes count) and genotoxicity biomarkers (Nuclear Abnormalities assay) were assessed.

Bioassays were performed to assess various endpoints within short-to longer-term exposures: avoidance behaviour (2 d), hatching (13 d), survival, reproduction and organisms’ size (based on the standard OECD test (28 d), the OECD extension (56 d), and the Full Life Cycle test – FLCt (46 d)). Based on the standard OECD test and its extension, NUCOP-M had a similar level of toxicity as copper oxychloride without indications of increase in toxicity over time (28 versus 56 d). The shorter-term exposures (2 and 13 d) showed higher toxicity for copper oxychloride. The exposure from cocoon stage (FLCt) seemed to provide an adaptative advantage (reduced toxicity) to NUCOP-M. The differences might be related to a slower release of Cu2+ ions from NUCOP-M, which seems to account for the toxicity at longer-term. Based on the recommended application doses (ca. 1.72 mg NUCOP-M kg−1, i.e. 0.62 mg Cu kg−1 in the topsoil) there is no unacceptable risk of NUCOP-M on the enchytraeid population. © 2024 The Authors",NA,1104

Leaf-washing experiments confirm the enhanced adhesion of RTD@SL-DTAC-Fe NMs to the surface of rice plant leaves compared to that of free RTD. Fluorescently labeled NMs exhibit bidirectional transport within rice plants, and RTD@SL-DTAC-Fe NMs demonstrates better transport performance than RTD. In vitro and in vivo antifungal tests indicate that encapsulation by NMs significantly enhanced pesticide activity. Field trials demonstrate that NMs exhibited prolonged efficacy compared to RTD.

For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00-1.49 mg of the active ingredient & sdot;kg- 1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT (R) at >= 0.66 mg kg- 1 and SPIN at >= 0.13 mg kg- 1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT (R) at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg- 1.

The results suggest that spinosynsbased products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems.",NA,1109

They act as agonists at postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), disrupting normal neurotransmission in target insects. Human exposure is high due to the widespread use of neonicotinoids and their residues in food. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro neurotoxicity of three neonicotinoid commercial formulations Much 600 FS (R) (imidacloprid 600 g L-1), Evidence 700 WG (R) (imidacloprid 700 g kg-1), and Actara 250 WG (R) (thiamethoxam 250 g kg-1) in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line.Methods Cells were incubated with the pesticides for 96 h, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated through the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) reduction and neutral red (NR) uptake assays. Toxicological pathways such as reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell death mode, and the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were also evaluated.Results EC50 values of 266.4, 4,175, and 653.2 mg L-1 were found for Much (R), Evidence (R) and Actara (R), respectively. Significant increases in ROS and RNS generation were observed for all pesticides, while mitochondrial membrane potential and Bax protein expression showed no significant changes. Analysis of cell death mode revealed an increase in early apoptotic cells.Conclusion Therefore, neonicotinoid insecticides are potentially neurotoxic, reinforcing concerns about human exposure to these commercial formulations.",NA,1110

While safeners are typically structurally similar to their co-formulated herbicides, they are classified as inert in the United States, meaning they are not held to the same regulatory standards as the herbicides. This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment. Regulatory agencies should consider reclassifying safeners as active ingredients to ensure adequate toxicity testing and risk assessment.",NA,1111

Given its several benefits, FIP is widely used in the agricultural and veterinary medicine fields, but its indiscriminate use can have ecotoxic effects on non-target species. Thus, the current study aimed to summarise and critically analyse FIP's ecotoxicity in aquatic animals. Data referring to bibliometric parameters (publication year and geographical distribution), experimental conditions (field and laboratory, FIP type, animal class, species, habitat, and exposure conditions), and biomarkers (oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurotoxicity, and morphological changes) were summarised and critically analysed. Ecotoxicological studies were mainly conducted with insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Exposure to pure FIP or FIP-based commercial formulation can induce mortality and have sublethal effects on non-target organisms, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage, genotoxicity (DNA damage), neurotoxicity, and morphological changes.

While many (eco)toxicology studies are performed in the laboratory under highly controlled circumstances, these studies may disregard the nuances and disorder that come with the complexity of natural aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments using laboratory system water, different lake waters, and different water parameters to determine the effects of ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D (0.00-4.00 ppm a.e.) on the development and survival of two freshwater game species (Sander vitreus and Esox lucius). For 2,4-D exposures using different water sources, there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and water source on walleye embryo and larval survival, however, there was no significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and water source. For 2,4-D exposures and pH (5-9 pH), there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and pH on walleye and northern pike embryo survival and a significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and pH. Our results indicate that 2,4-D exposures in controlled laboratory system water can predict similar outcomes as 2,4-D exposures in natural lake water. Moreover, individual water parameters, such as pH, play a significant role in the toxicity of 2,4-D.

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS : We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION : We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and inert ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of inert ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States.",NA,1117

Also, behavior analysis and oxidative stress and cholinergic effects biomarkers were analyzed at 1, 10 and 100 mu g IVM/L concentrations. For the embryonic stage, the active ingredient (96 h- LC 50 : 15900 mu g/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC 50 : 51230 mu g/L) during the acute period, while at chronic exposure the commercial formulation was more toxic (504 h-LC 50 : 10.25 mu g/L), compared to the active ingredient (504 h-LC 50 : 312.80 mu g/L).

Overall, larvae exhibited greater sensitivity to both the active ingredient and the commercial formulation. However, during chronic exposure, embryos were more sensitive to the commercial formulation than larvae.

Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application.

The obtained Pyr@LNC exhibits high encapsulation efficiency, tunable size, and excellent UV shielding to Pyr. Additionally, the flexible topology of the Pyr@LNC shell enhances the retention and adhesion of the foliar surface. Furthermore, Pyr@LNC exhibits pH/laccase-responsive targeting against Botrytis disease, enabling the intelligent release of Pyr. The in vivo fungicidal activity shows that efficacy of Pyr@LNC is 53%+/- 2% at 14 days postspraying, whereas the effectiveness of Pyr suspension concentrate is only 29% +/- 4%, and the acute toxicity of Pyr@LNC to zebrafish is reduced by more than 9-fold compared with that of Pyr technical. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that the LNCs can be bidirectionally translocated in plants. Therefore, the topology-regulated bidirectional delivery system LNC has great practical potential for sustainable agriculture.",NA,1127

The essential oil (EO) of citronella grass, Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, known for its repellent activity against many insects, is considered as source of potential bio-pesticides. In the present study, citronella oil was extracted from the leaves by hydro-distillation method and analysed for chemical constituents using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The phytochemical profiling of the same revealed the presence of thirteen mono- and sesqui-terpenoids, the major compounds being citronellal (26.38%), trans geraniol (24.61%) and citronellol (13.80%). A stable and homogeneous oil in water (O/W) nano-emulsion of citronella essential oil with oil content (15%) and Tween 80 (5%) was formulated and characterised for average diameter and surface charge on its droplets using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of nanometric spherical droplets. In laboratory bioassays, mortality of S. litura larvae was 100% at 10.0 mg mL(-1) and 12.50 mg mL(-1) concentrations of citronella EO and its nano-emulsion, respectively. The LC50 values were 5.52 mg mL(-1) on oil and 4.19 mg mL(-1) on nano-emulsion. Larval feeding on leaf discs treated with citronella EO and its nano-emulsion was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The Antifeedant Index (AFI) values at 25.0 mg mL(-1) of citronella oil and its nano-emulsion were 33.78 and 51.83, respectively. Both citronella EO and its nano-emulsion are potential candidates for development of botanical insecticides to control S. litura.",NA,1128

Nevertheless, glyphosate has been shown to bioaccumulate in the tissues of several organisms. To understand the bioconcentration dynamics of glyphosate in fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta forma fario) of different age were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, the formulation Roundup (R) LB Plus, and the major transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) for two, three, or four weeks at different temperatures in the laboratory. Mortality rates were determined, and tissue samples were collected at the end of the experiment to ascertain concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA residues by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results Brown trout mortality during exposure to glyphosate or AMPA was considerably higher at 15 degrees C than at 7 degrees C. Also, a significant increase in glyphosate concentrations in samples containing muscle, head, backbone, and caudal fin tissue with increasing exposure concentrations and temperatures was observed. Six-month-old fish contained more glyphosate per kg wet weight after exposure than ten-month-old fish. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for glyphosate and AMPA were much higher at 15 degrees C than at 7 degrees C, but in both cases decreased with higher glyphosate concentrations. The BCF for glyphosate formulated in Roundup (R) was higher than the one for the parent compound. Approximately 30-42% of the organ-absorbed glyphosate and AMPA remained in the tissues even when the fish were kept in clean water lacking the test substances for three weeks after termination of exposure. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that there is an interaction between glyphosate and ambient temperature in terms of toxicity. Further it was shown that increasing concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the surrounding media lead to significantly increased concentrations of these substances in brown trout tissues, although neither bioconcentration nor bioaccumulation of glyphosate in animal tissues is expected due to the high water solubility of this chemical. As a consequence, the uptake of glyphosate by humans through the consumption of contaminated edible fish is very likely.",NA,1129

In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess commercial methyl eugenol along with adulterants. For this purpose, commercial methyl eugenol was adulterated with different concentrations of xylene. The Raman spectral features of methyl eugenol and xylene in liquid formulations were examined, and Raman peaks were identified as associated with the methyl eugenol and adulterant. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLSR) have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the Raman spectral features. PCA was applied to differentiate Raman spectral data for various concentrations of methyl eugenol and xylene. Additionally, PLSR has been used to develop a predictive model to observe a quantitative relationship between various concentrations of adulterated methyl eugenol and their Raman spectral data sets. The root-mean-square errors of calibration and prediction were calculated using this model, and the results were found to be 1.90 and 3.86, respectively. The goodness of fit of the PLSR model is found to be 0.99.

To enhance the efficacy of the active ingredient, GBHs used in practice often contain other ingredients marked as inert adjuvants or co-formulants, the toxic properties of which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of pure glyphosate, three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) and two co-formulants commonly used in GBHs as assessed via CCK-8 assay, and the extent of their potential oxidative damage as assessed via superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, in order to reveal the role of adjuvants in the toxicity of the formulations. Our results showed that glyphosate alone did not significantly affect cell viability. In contrast, GBHs and adjuvants induced a pronounced cytotoxic effect from a concentration of 100 mu M. SOD activity of cells treated with GBHs or adjuvants was significantly lower compared to cells treated with glyphosate alone. This suggests that the adjuvants in GBHs are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the formulations through the induction of oxidative stress.",NA,1133

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret other ingredients in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing pesticide risks.",NA,1134

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay.Methodology/Principal findingsUsing standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifically enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides.Conclusions/SignificanceOur findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control.Monitoring the susceptibility of insect populations to chemical insecticides provides vital information for resistance management. New chemicals are being tested and added to the arsenal used for malaria prevention. As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard operating procedure for testing insecticide susceptibility in adult mosquitoes has been updated to include new active ingredients. To evaluate their susceptibility to clothianidin, a neonicotinoid or to flupyradifurone, a butenolide, adult mosquitoes are not exposed to the active ingredient alone, but to a mixture containing a surfactant which helps to solubilize the pesticide. In the present study, we report that surfactants such as vegetable oil esters or soap can enhance the potency of some active ingredients. Because of this synergistic action, the actual level of susceptibility of the insect populations tested can be largely overestimated. However, the results also reveal that some affordable products such as soaps can enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoids against mosquitoes. Although it remains unclear how soaps can be used as an adjuvant in insecticide formulations applied against mosquitoes, their potential utility warrants further investigations.",NA,1135

Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal transcribed spacer region gene-based amplicon sequencing and quantification of gene copy numbers were carried out after nucleic acid extraction from the cuticle of honey bees. The treatment with Steward (R) significantly affected fungal community composition and function. The fungal gene copy numbers were lower on the cuticle of bees treated with Difcor (R), Steward (R), and PPP mix A in comparison with the controls. However, bacterial and fungal gene copy numbers were increased in bees treated with Cantus (R) Gold, Mospilan (R), or PPP mix B compared to the controls. The bacterial cuticular community composition of bees treated with Cantus (R) Gold, Mospilan (R), and PPP mix B differed significantly from the control. In addition, Mospilan (R) on its own significantly changed the bacterial functional community composition. Cantus (R) Gold significantly affected fungal gene copy numbers, community, and functional composition. Our results demonstrate that PPPs show adverse effects on the cuticular microbiome of honey bees and suggest that PPP mixtures can cause stronger effects on the cuticular community than a PPP alone.

We measured biomarkers that included detoxification responses (glutathione S-transferase, GST), oxidative stress levels (lipid peroxidation, LPO, and catalase, CAT), DNA damage (comet assay), energy reserves (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and immune response (lysozyme activity, LYS). The absence of significant differences in catalase and lipid peroxidation levels suggested no oxidative stress due to fungicide exposure. However, the foliar fungicide Amistar (R) Xtra induced the highest GST activity and DNA fragmentation, suggesting synergistic effects between its active ingredients and undisclosed co-formulants. Similar effects observed with the Amistar (R) Xtra-Prosaro (R) mixture confirmed the greater toxicity of Amistar (R) Xtra.

The spread of impermeable surfaces in urban coastal areas increases runoff, carrying pollutants that degrade surface water quality and impact the stress responses of coastal fauna. This study investigated oxidative stress and gonad health in male and female Callinectes amnicola (blue crabs) from urban and suburban regions of Lagos Lagoon. Gonadal damage in the crabs was linked to estrogenic metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) and antioxidant responses (MDA, GSH, GPx, CAT, and SOD). Urban male crabs showed higher oxidative stress, with elevated MDA and lower GSH and CAT levels, alongside regressive gonadal changes due to increased Pb, Cd, and Zn exposure. Suburban crabs, however, displayed more intersex conditions (ovotestes) correlated with elevated Cu levels in lagoon sediment. These results highlight severe testicular disruption in urban males and ovarian dysgerminomas in suburban females, indicating a sex-specific impact of pollution on reproductive health. The study identifies two primary reproductive toxicity risks: (1) male testicular damage and regressive lesions in urban crabs, caused by increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and (2) female endocrine disruption, with ovotestes in suburban populations potentially leading to nonviable follicles. These findings emphasize that urban blue crabs face significant risks across both sexes, while suburban populations are more affected by female-specific risks. The study underscores the need for targeted environmental management to address the different stressors impacting these populations.",NA,1145

Still, recent research has shown that these products can cause mortality or trigger sublethal effects in these insects. Roundup Transorb R (R) (RT) is one of the GLY-based formulations sold in Brazil. It is used in several crops, and studies are required on its toxicity to honey bees. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate, under laboratory conditions, the lethal and sublethal effects of RT for adult workers (foragers) of Africanized A. mellifera. For this, two bioassays were carried out with Africanized honey bees. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of five treatments (T0 - control, T25 - 25 % GLY, T50 - 50 % GLY, T75 - 75 % GLY, and T100 GLY - 100 % recommended dose). The bioassays were carried out as follows: (1) Acute oral and topical exposure, evaluating mortality, effects on flight capacity, vertical displacement, and locomotion (in the latter only for oral contamination), consisting of five repetitions and 10 honey bees per repetition; (2) Chronic exposure via the oral route and spraying, assessing mortality, for both contamination routes and damage to the midgut epithelium thickness when contaminated via the oral route, composed of five replicates and 20 honey bees per replicate. The results showed that chronic oral exposure to RT can increase honeybee mortality and damage the thickness of their midgut epithelium. In addition, when acutely exposed orally, the honey bees had reduced walking ability. RT did not affect the other evaluated parameters.

Therefore, the degradation rates of particle-associated PMM and PM with OH radicals were studied under different conditions including particle type, relatively humidity (RH), and temperature. The experimental results indicated that the degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on hydrophilic SiO2 particles were faster than those adsorbed on hydrophobic SiO2 particles, suggesting that heterogeneous kinetics was affected by surface properties of SiO2 particles. The degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on these two kinds of SiO2 particles under experimental conditions ranged from (10.8 f 0.7) x 10-12 and (6.1 f 0.8) x 10-12 to (28.0 f 1.7) x 10-12 and (13.5 f 1.2) x 10-12 cm3 molecule- 1 s-1, respectively. Additionally, these rate constants showed a negative relationship with increasing RH level (20-80%) while a positive relationship with elevating temper- ature (5-35 degrees C). Arrhenius expressions for their heterogeneous degradation and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. According to the obtained degradation rates, the atmospheric lifetimes of particle- associated PMM and PM toward OH radicals were in the ranges of 9.9-25.8 and 20.7-46.1 h, respectively, suggesting that OH-initiated heterogeneous degradation might be an important pathway during their atmo- spheric transformation processes.

Nematodes, amphibians, molluscs, insects, and fish showed increased mortality after exposure to atrazine. Animals in the larval and juvenile stages showed greater susceptibility when exposed to different concentrations of atrazine. Furthermore, both commercial and pure formulations resulted in high mortality rates for exposed animals.

Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS : We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION : We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and inert ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of inert ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States.",NA,1157

Subsequently, knowledge gaps were identified, e.g. based on missing information on exposure-response relationships, gender differences, critical time-windows, interactions, and inadequate study quality.Results We identified over 200 occupational exposures with consistent or limited/inadequate evidence for associations with one or more of 60+ NCDs. Various exposures were identified as possible risk factors for multiple outcomes. Examples are diesel engine exhaust and cadmium, with consistent evidence for lung cancer, but limited/inadequate evidence for other cancer sites, respiratory, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Other examples are physically heavy work, shift work, and decision latitude/job control. For associations with limited/inadequate evidence, new studies are needed to confirm the association. For risk factors with consistent evidence, improvements in study design, exposure assessment, and case definition could lead to a better understanding of the association and help inform health-based threshold levels.Conclusions By providing an overview of knowledge gaps in the associations between occupational exposures and their health effects, our narrative review will help setting priorities in occupational health research. Future epidemiological studies should prioritize to include large sample sizes, assess exposures prior to disease onset, and quantify exposures. Potential sources of biases and confounding need to be identified and accounted for in both original studies and systematic reviews.",NA,1162

The objectives of this work were to review (1) the functioning and actors involved in the PPP framework processes, (2) the construction of the environmental risk assessment focused on biodiversity, and (3) the suggested ways to respond to the identified limits. Both literature from social sciences and ecotoxicology were examined. Despite the protective nature of the European regulation on PPPs, the very imperfect consideration of biodiversity in the evaluation process was underlined. The main limits are the multiplicity of applicable rules, the routinization of the evaluation procedures, the lack of consideration of social data, and the lack of independence of the evaluation. Strengths of the regulation are the decision to integrate a systemic approach in the evaluation of PPPs, the development of modeling tools, and the phytopharmacovigilance systems. The avenues for improvement concern the realism of the risk assessment (species used, cocktail effects ... ), a greater transparency and independence in the conduct of evaluations, and the opening of the evaluation and decision-making processes to actors such as beekeepers or NGOs.

Concentrations between 1 and 5000 mu g L-1 were chosen for acute exposures and 0.1 and 1 mu g L-1 for the subchronic one. After 14 days biochemical parameters, viability and sub-populations of hemocytes, reproductive parameters, embryotoxicity and offspring' survival were studied. Egg masses laid between day 12 and 14 were separated to continue the exposure and the embryos were examined daily. Offspring' survival and morphological changes were registered for 14 days after hatching. 48 h-LC50, NOEC and LOEC were similar between CF and AI, however the CF caused more sub-lethal effects. CF but not the AI decreased carboxylesterases, catalase and the proportion of hyalinocytes with respect to the total hemocytes, and increased superoxide dismutase and the % of granulocytes with pseudopods.

The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses.

Nanoformulations of pesticides are being developed as potential alternatives due to their beneficial properties, including enhanced solubility, targeted delivery to the site of action, improved stability and efficacy and reduced non-target effects. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment is necessary for these emerging nanopesticides compared to existing formulations, aiming to ascertain whether their nano characteristics exacerbate toxicity for non-target organisms. This study investigated the toxicity of tebuconazole (TBZ) in different formulations, including nanoformulations (poly-epsilon-caprolactone [PCL] and nanostructured lipid carrier [NLC] loaded with TBZ), as well as a commercial formulation, on the reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in both aqueous and soil matrices. Additionally, the impact of the correspondent nanocarriers without TBZ on C. elegans was examined. In water, TBZ in the form of nano and commercial formulations exhibited higher toxicity on the nematodes' reproduction than the TBZ (a.s.) attributable to higher freely dissolved concentrations of TBZ, which resulted in a toxicity order, ranging from the most to the least toxic as follows: NLC-TBZ > PCL-TBZ > commercial formulation > TBZ (a.s.). For NLC-TBZ, the excess toxicity could be clearly explained by combined toxicity of TBZ (a.s.) and nanocarriers, with the effect addition of the separate single compounds matching the observed effects of the nanoformulation. For PCL-TBZ, effects were stronger than expected from the effect addition of TBZ (a.s.) and PCL nanocarriers, potentially due to enhanced bioavailability of encapsulated TBZ in the gut of the nematodes. In soil, NLC with and without loaded TBZ showed higher toxicity than other tested compounds, while PCL nanocarriers without TBZ did not exhibit negative effects on the reproduction of C. elegans. Microcosm experiment, where long-term effects on native soil nematode fauna were tested, confirmed that TBZ-nanoformulations act via combined toxic effects of TBZ and nanocarriers.

To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition.

Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers.

The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling.

Their mode of action is based on blocking the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme which exists in all species with mitochondria. SDH is involved in two interconnected metabolic processes for energy production: cellular respiration, where it enables the transfer of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the Krebs cycle, where it catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. In humans, inherited SDH deficiencies can induce encephalopathies and cancers. The cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the genetic inactivation of SDH have been well described in tumours, where it causes an oxidative stress, a pseudohypoxia phenotype, a metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptomic remodelling, and alterations in migration and invasion capacities of cancer cells, related to the accumulation of an oncometabolite, the succinate, following SDH inactivation. The use of SDHi fungicides has raised many questions in recent years. Their mode of action, which aims at altering mitochondrial functions essential for energy production and metabolic homeostasis, is not specific to fungi, suggesting that they could also be toxic to humans and biodiversity. The impact of SDHis on health remains largely unexplored to date on exposure and impregnation on farmers and the general population. In addition, the physicochemical properties of SDHis make them potentially persistent in soils and organisms, and a growing number of studies report toxic effects of SDHis in non -target species. The analysis of regulatory assessment reports shows that most SDHi substances induce tumours in animals, with no evidence of genotoxicity.

This review identifies and investigates the likely drivers of this decline and resilience, and discusses their relative importance from a holistic viewpoint. Pesticides (particularly neonicotinoid insecticides), climate change, and habitat loss are likely to be the prime drivers of contemporary decline and instability in monarch population dynamics. Natural enemies (predators, parasites, and pathogens) are less likely to be a major contributor to contemporary population fluctuations, except on a local scale. Adaptation to changing environmental conditions will be an important component of the ongoing ability of western monarchs to show resilience. Human involvement with monarchs is a good and necessary thing for sustainable conservation, helping to prevent the 'extinction of experience', and the loss of human-nature contact, which has major adverse implications for nature conservation generally.Abstract Monarch butterfly populations in western North America suffered a substantial decline, from millions of butterflies overwintering in California in the 1980s to less than 400,000 at the beginning of the 21st century. The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides in the mid-1990s and their subsequent widespread use appears to be the most likely major factor behind this sudden decline. Habitat loss and unfavorable climates (high temperatures, aridity, and winter storms) have also played important and ongoing roles. These factors kept overwintering populations stable but below 300,000 during 2001-2017. Late winter storm mortality and consequent poor spring reproduction drove winter populations to less than 30,000 butterflies during 2018-2019. Record high temperatures in California during the fall of 2020 appeared to prematurely terminate monarch migration, resulting in the lowest overwintering population (1899) ever recorded. Many migrants formed winter-breeding populations in urban areas. Normal seasonal temperatures in the autumns of 2021 and 2022 enabled overwintering populations to return to around the 300,000 level, characteristic of the previous two decades. Natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens) may be important regional or local drivers at times but they are a consistent and fundamental part of monarch ecology. Human interference (capture, rearing) likely has the least impact on monarch populations. The rearing of monarch caterpillars, particularly by children, is an important human link to nature that has positive ramifications for insect conservation beyond monarch butterflies and should be encouraged.",NA,1181

The nanodelivery system showed the prolonged effectivity of EB with reduced degradation and demonstrated a good control efficacy for multiple target pests, such as red spider mite, beet armyworm larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and rice stem borers (Chilo suppressalis). Toxicology tests on various objects demonstrated that the EBWNS has low toxicity for seeds, HaCaT cells, zebrafish, earthworm, and E. coli.

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret other ingredients in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay.Methodology/Principal findingsUsing standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifically enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides.Conclusions/SignificanceOur findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control.Monitoring the susceptibility of insect populations to chemical insecticides provides vital information for resistance management. New chemicals are being tested and added to the arsenal used for malaria prevention. As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard operating procedure for testing insecticide susceptibility in adult mosquitoes has been updated to include new active ingredients. To evaluate their susceptibility to clothianidin, a neonicotinoid or to flupyradifurone, a butenolide, adult mosquitoes are not exposed to the active ingredient alone, but to a mixture containing a surfactant which helps to solubilize the pesticide. In the present study, we report that surfactants such as vegetable oil esters or soap can enhance the potency of some active ingredients. Because of this synergistic action, the actual level of susceptibility of the insect populations tested can be largely overestimated. However, the results also reveal that some affordable products such as soaps can enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoids against mosquitoes. Although it remains unclear how soaps can be used as an adjuvant in insecticide formulations applied against mosquitoes, their potential utility warrants further investigations.",NA,1186

Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models.

The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity.

Although adjuvants are generally considered to be biologically inert, some adjuvants have exhibited toxicity and sublethal effects, including decreasing survival rates of next-generation queens. Honey bees have a highly developed olfactory system to detect and discriminate among social signals. To investigate the impact of pesticide-adjuvant combinations on honey bee signal perception, we performed electroantennography assays to assess alterations in their olfactory responsiveness to the brood ester pheromone (BEP), the volatile larval pheromone beta-ocimene, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. These assays aimed to uncover potential mechanisms underlying changes in social behaviors and reduced brood survival after pesticide exposure. We found that combining the adjuvant Dyne-Amic with the fungicide Tilt (propiconazole) and the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole) synergistically enhanced olfactory responses to three concentrations of BEP and as well exerted dampening and compensatory effects on responses to 2-heptanone and beta-ocimene, respectively. In contrast, exposure to adjuvant alone or the combination of fungicide and insecticide had no effect on olfactory responses to BEP at most concentrations but altered responses to beta-ocimene and 2-heptanone. Exposure to Dyne-Amic, Altacor, and Tilt increased BEP signal amplitude, indicating potential changes in olfactory receptor sensitivity or sensilla permeability to odorants.

While anthelmintic effects on non-target animals, such as dungdwelling insects, are well studied, effects on seed germination are largely unknown. Seeds can come into contact with anthelmintics either during passage through the gastro-intestinal tract of grazing animals or when anthelmintics are excreted with their dung into the environment, which may result in changed germination patterns.We used four commonly applied macrocyclic lactones to assess their effects on germination: moxidectin, ivermectin, abamectin and doramectin as pure substances; moxidectin and ivermectin also in formulated form. We tested these pharmaceuticals on 17 different temperate grassland species from five plant families. Seeds were exposed to three concentrations of macrocyclic lactones (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg.l(-1)) under controlled conditions, and germination was assessed over a 6-week period.

The results showed that the MCs released more slowly in water with increasing particle sizes and capsule compactness, and they sunk more quickly with the increasing particle sizes and core density. Additionally, MCs with slower release speed was always accompanied with lower acute toxicity levels to zebrafish. When the release dynamics slowed down to the threshold dose on demand for disease control, facilitating settlement of MCs can further reduce toxicity within spatial and temporal dimensions. The poor accumulation of MCs with larger particle sizes or dense shell in gills was closely related to their efficient detoxification.

APs act as buffer zones and mitigate pesticide transfer of farm plots to natural water resources. As part of a two-paper series, this paper addresses the application and validation of the PESTIPOND model. PESTIPOND is a process-based model developed to predict pesticides' behavior and distribution in APs located in drained agricultural catchments. Paper I (Bahi et al., 2023a) describes the development and sensitivity analysis of the model. PESTIPOND was applied on the Rampillon AP to characterize the fate of seven different pesticides and five monitoring periods while considering the key transfer and transformation processes. The model was assessed through various methods against the observed data in simulating pesticide dynamics. The statistical and graphical evaluation of PESTIPOND reflected a good performance except for boscalid. The sensitivity analysis and application of the model evidenced that adsorption-desorption and biotransformation in the pond water are major processes behind pesticide dissipation. Hydrophobic and lowly mobile pesticides are more likely to be bio-transformed at the water-sediment interface. This work highlights the link between the hydraulic residential time (HRT), temperature, and APs' efficiency in minimizing pesticide transfer into the environment. The model predicted that the actual efficiency of the AP covering 0.15% of the drained catchment would double if the pond's surface area covered at least 1% of the catchment. Moreover, the model's predictions evidenced that a temperature rise of 10 degrees C will increase the dissipation of pesticides by only 8%.

In this study the impact of crop type (spring wheat and corn) and cultivation intensity on the community of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in the forest-steppe of Western Siberia was investigated. A total of 39 species from 15 genera were collected. Ground beetles' community was characterized by a high evenness of species distribution across the agroecosystems. The average Jaccard's similarity index for species presence/absence was 65%, and for abundance it was 54%. The significant difference in the distribution of predatory and mixophytophages ground beetles in wheat crops (U test, P < 0.05) can be justified by the constant suppression of the weed component and the use of insecticides that lead to the dominance of the predators. Fauna of wheat crops was more diverse than that in corn (Margalef index, U test, P < 0.05). No significant differences in biological diversity indexes, except for the Simpson dominance index (U test, P < 0.05, wheat), were found in ground beetle communities in crops at different levels of intensification. A certain differentiation of predatory species was caused by the selective occurrence of the litter-soil species, especially abundant in the row-crop. The specificity of the ground beetle community of corn crops may have been caused by repeated inter-row tillage, which influenced the increase in porosity and topsoil relief and contributed to the creation of favorable microclimatic conditions. In general, the applied level of agrotechnological intensification had no significant effect on the species composition and ecological structure of beetle communities in agrolandscapes. The use of bioindicators made it possible to assess the environmental sustainability of the agricultural environment and also creates the prerequisites for the development of ecologically directed correction of agrotechnological operations in agroecosystem management.",NA,1199

This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value.

Two French Mediterranean lagoons (Thau and Or) were monitored fora range of 68 pesticides continuously over a period of a year (2015-16). The find-ings revealed mixtures of dissolved pesticides with varying composition and levels over the year. The Or site contained more pesticides than Thau site (37 vs 28 different substances), at higher concentrations (0.1-58.6 ng.L-1 at Or vs <0.1-9.9 at Thau) and with overall higher detection frequencies. All samples showed a potential chronic toxicity risk, depending on the composition and concentrations of co-occurring pesticides. In 74 % of the samples, this pesticide risk was driven by a few single substances (ametryn, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorotoluron, irgarol, diu-ron and metolachlor) and certain transformation products (e.g. DPMU and metolachlor OA/ESA). Individually, these were a threat for the three taxa studied (phytoplankton, crustaceans and fish). Yet even a drastic reduction of these drivers alone (up to 5 % of their current concentration) would not eliminate the toxicity risks in 56 % of the Or Lagoon samples, due to pesticide mixtures. The two CA-based approaches used to assess the combined effect of these mixtures, determined chronic potential negative impacts for both lagoons, while no acute risk was highlighted. This risk was sea-sonal, indicating the importance of monitoring in key periods (summer, winter and spring) to get a more realistic pic-ture of the pesticide threat in lagoon waters. These findings suggest that it is crucial to review the current EU Water Framework Directive's risk-assessment method, as it may incorrectly determine pesticide risk in lagoons.",NA,1213
