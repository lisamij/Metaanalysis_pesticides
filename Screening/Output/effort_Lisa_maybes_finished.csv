Several species, including the horn-faced bee (Osmia cornifrons) and the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria), are commercially managed, primarily for the pollination of fruit trees and tree nuts. They are efficient pollinators and have high pollen fidelity, and so can greatly benefit orchard yields compared to honey bees (Apis mellifera) alone. Apis mellifera are often used as surrogates for other pollinators during pesticide risk assessment. Non-Apis bee species, however, can be more sensitive to certain pesticides, so it is also important to research the impact of novel pesticides on other bee species. This study investigated the effect of two formulated pesticide products containing recently approved active ingredients, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone, on the survival of A. mellifera and three species of mason bees (O. lignaria, O. cornifrons, and Osmia californica). Bees were orally exposed to sulfoxaflor or flupyradifurone and their survival was measured over four days following exposure. Bee sensitivity to the insecticides varied by species and sex of bee. Apis mellifera was the least sensitive, followed by O. cornifrons, with O. lignaria and O. californica as the most sensitive. Male Osmia spp. bees were less sensitive than females. These insecticides may pose a higher risk to the health of Osmia spp. compared to A. mellifera. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",NA,"7"

Despite the efforts of regulatory agencies, there still is a lack of information regarding short- and long-term exposures to soil-dwellers, as well as effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT® and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00–1.49 mg of the active ingredient·kg−1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT® at ≥0.66 mg kg−1 and SPIN at ≥0.13 mg kg−1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT® at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg−1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT® and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT® and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT® on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT® and SPIN. The results suggest that spinosyns-based products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors",NA,"15"

Leaching of the studied herbicides was influenced by pH of the soil and herbicides leached more readily in alkaline soils than in acidic soil. Among alkaline soils, leaching was positively correlated with OM content of the soil. Addition of surfactant increased the leaching of herbicides and their TPs, resulting in lower residues in the upper layers and higher residues in the lower layers and leachates indicating greater potential for deeper soil contamination. Additionally, breakthrough curves for iodosulfuron methyl appeared earlier when the soil columns were treated with commercial formulation in the presence of surfactant. Among the different TPs, mesosulfuron (M1) and 2-[3-(4-hydroxy-6-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl) ureidosulfonyl]−4-methane sulfonamidomethyl benzoate (M2) TPs of mesosulfuron methyl and metsulfuron methyl (I1) and (methyl-2-(amino-sulfonyl) benzoate (I2) TPs of iodosulfuron methyl were detected. M2 has the highest mobility followed by M1 and I1 suggesting higher risk of M2 to contaminate lower soil profiles and groundwater thereby posing long-term ecological and human health risks.

Although certain effects are expected, the combination effects of insecticides and dispersants remain elusive. Here, five different classes of insecticides (i.e., dinotefuran, fipronil, hydramethylnon, indoxacarb, and etofenprox) were dispersed in water, PEG, and PLE, and their lung inflammation potential was evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis 24 h after intratracheal instillation into the lungs of rats. All chemicals dispersed in water caused no inflammation. However, among the five chemicals dispersed in PEG and PLE, only hydramethylnon showed significant neutrophilic inflammation and hydramethylnon in PEG showed 4-fold higher inflammogenic potential than that in PLE. The in vitro cytotoxic potential of hydramethylnon in PEG was 10–17 fold (in A549) or 12–14 fold (in dTHP-1) higher than that of hydramethylnon in PLE, and greater than 370 fold (in A549) or 65–169 fold (in dTHP-1) higher than that in water. PEG toxicity increased due to the micellar formulation of hydramethylnon in PEG, increasing cellular uptake by simple diffusion. Therefore, the observed potentiation effect highlights that the combination effect of formulation of hydrophobic compounds with dispersants should be carefully evaluated. © 2025",NA,"27"

Here we investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan®SG (active ingredient acetamiprid) on plant bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae), a dominant group of European grassland insect communities. In a controlled field study, the abundance of three focal species was reduced by up to 92% two days after field exposure at concentrations expected at field margins, with mortality varying among species. Follow-up feeding assays with insecticide-treated host plants in the greenhouse and controlled dose-response laboratory assays confirmed the strong negative effects on non-target species. Strikingly, when comparing the lethal dose 50 derived from Mospilan®SG with a value reported for honeybees using another acetamiprid formulation, the insecticide was over 11,000 times more toxic to plant bugs than to honeybees. In addition, males were 20 times more sensitive than females in the two tested species. Thus, continuous exposure to this neonicotinoid may reduce plant bug populations and promote insecticide-tolerant species, altering community composition. We suggest that sex-specific sensitivity be considered in risk assessment and conclude that the true risk to non-target insects is currently greatly underestimated. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,"29"

Assessing dermal absorption is key for evaluating pesticide exposure. The initial approach to risk assessment involves using default dermal absorption values or applying read-across data from experimental results from different formulations. In this way, to support non-dietary pesticide risk assessment focused but not limited to Brazil, this project evaluated 759 GLP-compliant in vitro human skin dermal absorption studies covering 25 formulation types and 248 active substances at multiple concentrations using interpretable machine learning techniques. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees – BART method indicated that Log Pow and molecular weight have the highest importance when predicting dermal absorption; both parameters exhibit moderate interaction uncertainty within each other and with formulation groups water-based and organic-solvent based and with tested form (concentrates or dilutions). The default values for each formulation group were determined using the upper bound of a non-parametric confidence interval for a specified quantile, with calculations conducted via bootstrapping methods; the proposed values correspond to the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 95th percentile: for concentrates, 10% for organic-solvent based, 4% for water-based and 3% for solid formulations. For dilutions, 42% for organic-solvent based, 37% for water-based and 39% for solid formulations. Organic-solvent based dermal absorption values from experimental data can be used as conservative surrogates for solid and water-based formulations. When no experimental data is available for higher spray dilutions of a given formulation type, a pro-rated correction is proposed to a 2 to 5-fold concentration difference, limited to the respective formulation group default value. © 2025 The Authors",NA,"32"

Using the commercial pesticide preparations containing glyphosate, it was shown that the degree of inhibition of the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc largely depends on the formulants rather than on the active ingredient in their composition. Moreover, the combined inhibitory effect of the pesticides mixture on the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc was not additive.

In response to these concerns, we have purified the active components of these adjuvants, specifically a series of oligomers of hydroxy(polyethyleneoxy) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H), including ethylene oxide (EO) units ranging from 4 to 12. For analysis of TSS-H in zebrafish and water, a method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC[sbnd]HRMS) was developed. The findings revealed that at total TSS-H concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg, the average recovery rate of TSS-H containing 4 to 12 EO units in zebrafish ranged from 81.2 % to 107.2 %, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0.1 % and 8.4 %. The 96-hour LC50 of TSS-H in zebrafish was 6.71±0.04 mg/L. At exposure concentrations of 0.0671 mg/L and 0.671 mg/L, TSS-H oligomers reached a steady state in zebrafish within 14–21 days, with concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 0.05 mg/kg and 0.018 to 0.348 mg/kg, respectively. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for TSS-H oligomers (4–12 EO units) were 1.87–11.59 at the low dose and 0.79–9.19 at the high dose after 14 days. The elimination half-lives of the oligomers were <2.37 days during the elimination phase. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed both TSS-H doses significantly impacted lipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, with disruptions largely associated with abnormal energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and alterations in membrane composition.

Whilst research on herbicides in relation to bees is growing, we still have more to learn about how bees may interact with herbicides and the subsequent consequences for bee health. As herbicides are designed to kill the plants they are applied to, bees and other pollinators may interact with them in a different way to other pesticide groups which is important to understand in the context of evaluating hazard and risk. Here, we conducted both a choice and no-choice test, to determine if bumblebees would be deterred from foraging from feeders containing commercial formulations of Roundup (Ultra and Biactive, respectively) compared to controls. We found across both experiments that bees were deterred from foraging where feeders contained above field-realistic concentrations of Roundup formulation, and that on average colonies reduced their consumption from these feeders by ~50% despite lacking other food sources. This demonstrates that, when given no choice, bees can be deterred from sucrose containing Roundup Biactive, although above expected field concentrations, even to their own nutritional detriment. Separately, individual foragers were observed avoiding feeders containing field-realistic levels of Roundup Ultra compared to controls, showing a preference for uncontaminated feed when given a choice. As this was an experimental setup using high concentrations of Roundup with sucrose solution rather than real flowers, more work is needed to understand this phenomenon under field conditions. This work provides useful information and insights for future studies investigating the impacts of glyphosate in the form of both active substance and formulation on bees and could also be useful in identifying future mitigation strategies for field use. © The Author(s) 2025.",NA,"47"

Nanotechnology can efficiently be used to improve the utilization rate and enhance the efficacy of herbicides for advanced modern sustainable agriculture. Herein, a novel smart delivery system was developed to promote permeability performance and precision targeting of weeds for enhanced herbicidal activity. The current study designed and applied an efficient and eco-friendly nano-herbicide via metamifop (MP) modified by hydrophilic and lipophilic diblock polymer (HLDP), namely MP@HLDP. The HLDP was assembled with MP via electrostatic interaction, and the spontaneous complexation of MP with HLDP formed nearly spherical nanoparticles. The presence of HLDP reduced the contact angle of MP while increasing its retention, resulting in better foliar wettability and easier spreading of the droplets on weed leaves. Meanwhile, the plant uptake of MP@HLDP was enhanced, remarkably improving its herbicidal activity toward weed Echinochloa crus-galli (E. crusgalli), when compared to the commercial emulsion oil and technical compound even at a 30% reduced dosage. The conjoint analysis of transcriptomic and metabolome data indicated activation of the plant death responses by MP@HLDP nanoparticles through inhibiting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and chlorophyll metabolism. The safety evaluation of MP@HLDP nanoparticles on rice crops and systematic model nontarget organism revealed good safety to rice seedlings with reduced acute toxicity to aquatic zebrafish.

However, current systems face challenges in achieving both high encapsulation rates and drug loading capacities. This study introduces a novel method using chitosan (CS) and sodium lignosulfonate (SL) to co-assemble with avermectin (AVM), a widely used hydrophobic pesticide, forming AVM-CS-SL micro-nano capsules. Engineered under optimized conditions of pH 5 and 40 °C, the capsules exhibit an AVM encapsulation efficiency of 84.27 % and a loading capacity of 90 %. The AVM-CS-SL capsules demonstrate multifunctional attributes that enhance pesticide application. The capsules, with an average diameter of 356 nm, facilitate stable embedding in leaf grooves and enable effective adhesion to leaf surfaces, thereby improving their resistance to wash-off by rain compared to conventional formulations. Their core-shell structure protects AVM from photodegradation, ensuring long-term stability and efficacy. The capsules also exhibit enhanced bioactivity, with higher mortality rates in Plutella xylostella larvae and low genotoxicity to Vicia faba plants.

Additionally, their production involves synthetic chemicals and generates large amounts of by-products, further exacerbating the ecological burden. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an environmentally friendly nanodelivery system that can enhance the efficacy of pesticides while minimizing both environmental and health risks. Here, a metal mineralization strategy was employed to reinforce the self-assembly of biocompatible nanocapsules with versatile surface functionalities for smart delivery of lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT). During the homogenization process, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), chitosan (COS), and copper ions co-precipitated at the oil–water interface and self-assembled into core–shell nanocapsules, acquiring the desired surface functionality through electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and metal coordination. The resulting LCT@CMC@COS-Cu nanocapsules demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency for LCT and superior pesticide delivery performance targeting lepidopteran pests, enabled by the alkaline- and cellulase-responsive polysaccharide-based capsule shells. Foliar washing experiments demonstrated that LCT@CMC@COS-Cu adhere efficiently to the surface of soybean leaves and achieved bidirectional transport through the plant's vascular system. Notably, LCT@CMC@COS-Cu significantly extended the half-life of LCT under UV irradiation by 9.9-fold compared to technical LCT. In pot experiments, the mortality rate of Spodoptera litura larvae treated with LCT@CMC@COS-Cu (56.67 %) was significantly higher than that of the LCT suspension concentrate (16.67 %) after 12 days, implying prolonged efficacy. Safety evaluations of the nano-formulation were conducted using plant, zebrafish, Harmonia axyridis, and in vivo mice models, further confirming its excellent safety profile.

To counter these challenges, the development of nanoformulations represents a pivotal strategy. These advanced formulations are designed to enhance the efficacy of active ingredients (AIs) and reduce ecological impacts, thereby addressing the need for sustainable agricultural development. Objectives: The study aims to fabricate a highly leaf-adhesive and anti-UV herbicide nanoformulation, designed to enhance the herbicidal activity and utilization rates of AIs. Methods: Herein, the herbicide nanoformulations (Called CB@MSNs-TA-Fe) are synthesized by incorporating cyhalofop-butyl into tannic acid-Fe (III) ions-coated functionalized mesoporous silica. The foliar retention performance of the samples was assessed integrating SEM observation and HPLC analysis. Results: The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe with rough outer surface displays typical core–shell structure featuring an average diameter of about 118 nm. After amino modification, the CB@MSNs-TA-Fe shows enhanced loading rate for CB (14.4 ± 0.2 %) and superior thermal stability. The release rate of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe under acidic conditions is higher compared to that under alkaline and neutral conditions. Upon UV irradiation, the half-life of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe nanoparticles is 12.4 times higher than that of CB technical (CB TC). Enhanced foliar adhesion of CB@MSNs-TA-Fe on hydrophobic leaf surfaces is observed, which can effectively mitigate the risk of wash-off by rainfall. The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe displays enhanced herbicidal efficacies against barnyard grass under UV irradiation or simulated rainwater scouring, compared with CB TC and CB oil dispersion. Furthermore, the TA-Fe-coated MSNs-NH2 nano-carrier (MSNs-TA-Fe) reveals excellent biosafety on rice, zebrafish, and earthworms.

We evaluated their effects on Daphnia magna survival, body stores, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Although after 24 h the traditional formulation had greater lethality than the nanopesticide, after 48 h this pattern was reversed. At 24 °C the lethality of both pesticides increased. BChE activity was inhibited at 24 °C by both pesticides. In general, the increase in temperature negatively affected protein and glycogen content. The traditional formulation reduced glycogen content at 24 °C. A decrease in lipid content and the whole energy budget was observed in organisms exposed to the traditional formulation at both temperatures. Although the nano-based pesticide developed a delayed toxicity, it was more lethal than the traditional one in the long term. The temperature rise worsened the pesticides effects in terms of decreased survival, BChE activity inhibition, and energy reserves depletion. The development and regulation of new eco-safer nanopesticides needs to be complemented by their ecotoxicological assessment.

Embryos were exposed to imidacloprid (IMI) and β-cyfluthrin (β-CYF) in the following ratios: 0.001 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.000125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C1); 0.01 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.00125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C2); 0.1 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.0125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C3); 1.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C4); 10.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 1.25 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C5) for 144 h. The results showed a mortality of 50 % of organisms in the C5 concentration. Embryos exposed to C1 and C3 showed tachycardia and hatched early compared to the negative control, indicating cardiotoxic and embryotoxic effects. The two highest concentrations tested (C4 and C5) induced evident morphological changes (yolk sac and pericardial edema, and spine alterations), and skeletal toxicity (absence of cartilage and bone formation), along with decreased larval swimming behavior. Also, the formulated insecticide (C1) increased ROS levels in zebrafish larvae. Results showed that the formulated insecticide containing IMI and β-CYF induces several toxic effects on developing zebrafish, indicating its environmental risk to aquatic organisms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",NA,"87"

In line with this objective, we present green preparation of a colloidal pesticide formulation using optimized lysine-derived carbon dots (LysCDs)-modified CaCO3 (LysCDs/CaCO3) particles as the carrier and abamectin (Abm) as the active ingredient. The loading capacity of abamectin in this colloidal pesticide (LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm) is 1.7 to 2.1 times higher than that of its counterpart (CaCO3/Abm) prepared without LysCDs, which is attributed to the increased specific surface area and pore volume of LysCDs/CaCO3 particles. Due to the acid-induced degradation of CaCO3, the release of abamectin for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm is accelerated under weakly acidic conditions, which is accompanied by the release of Ca2+ ions and the fluorescence changes of LysCDs. The incorporation of LysCDs enhances the photostability and foliar adhesiveness of this colloidal pesticide, resulting in the highest degree of foliar retention when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or rainfall, compared to free-form abamectin and CaCO3/Abm. This results in the best performance of pest control on Plutella xylostella for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm in both indoor and outdoor tests. Nontarget biocompatibility evaluations show that LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm exhibits lower acute toxicity to zebrafish and earthworms than free-form abamectin. In addition, this colloidal pesticide is favored by the minimal residue of the adjuvant material after abamectin release, which is converted into harmless Ca2+ ions, CO2, and LysCDs. Therefore, this work designs a safer and more effective colloidal pesticide formulation to deliver abamectin with minimal adjuvant residue, realizing its trajectory as basically “circular and green”. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",NA,"95"

This study explores a novel approach using emamectin benzoate (EB) as a model pesticide, leveraging non-covalent molecular interactions to co-assemble nanocomplexes with cyclodextrin (β-CD) and polylactic acid (PLA) conjugates (β-CD-PLA-EB). Notably, these complexes were formulated without additional adjuvants. Optimal assembly occurred at an EB to β-CD to PLA ratio of 1:3, yielding stable beaded structures measuring 383.02 nm. These structures derive stability from electrostatic, hydrophobic, and π-π stacking interactions, ensuring excellent solubility and durability in aqueous environments. Importantly, the β-CD-PLA-EB formulation not only enhances the UV stability of EB but also extends its half-life significantly-nearly five times that of free EB. This formulation responds dynamically in alkaline conditions, intelligently releasing active ingredients within the alkaline intestinal microenvironment of lepidopteran pests. Rain-wash resistance tests demonstrated 50.03 % greater retention of β-CD-PLA-EB on corn leaves compared to EB WG suspension. Indoor and field trials further revealed enhanced residual activity and prolonged efficacy of β-CD-PLA-EB over EB WG, while also mitigating drug solution drift during application. Safety assessments indicated over a 26-fold reduction in acute toxicity to zebrafish compared to EB WG.

Currently, multiple formulations of 2,4-D and dicamba are available on the market. Even though the active ingredient is the same, the chemical formulation may vary, which can influence the volatility potential of these herbicides. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the response of soybean, cotton, and tobacco plants exposed to vapors of 2,4-D and dicamba formulations alone or mixed in humidomes for 24 h. Humidome studies were conducted in an open pavilion at the Lake Wheeler Turfgrass Field Lab of the North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. Dicamba and mixture treatments injured and caused a reduction in the height of soybean. Injury varied from 55% to 70%, and average plant height was 8.8 cm shorter compared with untreated control plants. Treatments with 2,4-D caused the least injury to soybean (≤21%), and differences among formulations were identified (dimethylamine > choline > dimethylamine-monomethylamine). However, soybean height was not affected by 2,4-D treatments. No differences between treatments were observed when herbicides were applied to cotton. The greatest injury to tobacco (23.3%) was caused by dicamba dimethylamine. Overall, the effect of 2,4-D and dicamba vapor was species-specific and formulation-dependent.

Globally, more than 2000 commercial GLY-based herbicides (GBHs) are used to control weeds. Non-target organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real environmental conditions, but the co-formulants contained in GBHs are classified as so-called inert and inactive ingredients in terms of their biological effects. The main objective of this comprehensive review is to compile the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies on the side-effects of GLY, GBHs, and their formulating agents. Based on the results demonstrated for a variety of plant and animal aquatic organisms, oxidative stress appears to be a major trigger for these adverse effects, affecting the integrity of DNA and other biochemical functions. Furthermore, there is evidence of impairment of various physiological and behavioral functions. Adverse effects of GLY and GBHs have been observed even at very low concentrations. There are also differences in the sensitivity of the aquatic organisms tested, even with similar lifestyles, habitats or identical taxa. The studies typically investigate the short-term effects of a single exposure to GLY/GBH on a single species, whilst in reality multiple applications of GBHs together with other pesticides are common during a cropping cycle. Moreover, the interactions between GLY/GBHs and other aquatic contaminants are rarely studied. Higher toxicity of GBHs compared to GLY alone has often been observed, demonstrating that co-formulants can be highly toxic on their own and markedly increase the toxicity of the GBH formulation. The possible impurities in GBHs, such as heavy metals, can cause additional problems for the environment and food safety. The widespread and massive use of GBHs leads to increased exposure and environmental hazards. In addition, the need for a revision of the risk assessment system is emphasized. According to the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies, the current use and pollution of the aquatic environment by GLY/GBHs is highly problematic and cannot be considered environmentally sustainable. It is, therefore, necessary to at least tighten the permitted forms of use. © The Author(s) 2024.",NA,"143"

Specifically, CTAB and CTAC exhibited minimal or no impact on the photolysis of four NIs, while TX-100 significantly inhibited their decay. Such inhibitory effect could mainly be attributed weakening the formation of key transient intermediates, such as the corresponding radical cation (NI•+), radical anion (NI•-) as well as hydrated electron (eaq-).

Most commercial compound formulations are open systems with non-adjustable released rates, resulting in a high frequency of applications. Meanwhile, although nano pesticide delivery systems constructed with different carrier materials have been extensively studied, realizing their actual scale-up production still has important practical significance due to the large-scale field application. In this study, a boscalid and pyraclostrobin dual-loaded nano pesticide system (BPDN) was constructed with industrial-grade carrier materials to facilitate the realization of large-scale production. The optimal industrial-scale preparation mechanism of BPDN was studied with surfactants as key factors. When agricultural emulsifier No.600 and polycarboxylate are used as the ratio of 1:2 in the preparation process, the BPDN has a spherical structure with an average size of 270 nm and exhibits superior physical stability. Compared with commercial formulation, BPDN maintains rate-stabilized release up to 5 times longer, exhibits better dispersion and spreading performance on foliar, has more than 20% higher deposition amounts, and reduces loss. A single application of BPDN could efficiently control tomato gray mold during the growing period of tomatoes due to extended duration and combinatory effectiveness, reducing two application times and labor costs. Toxicology tests on various objects systematically demonstrated that BPDN has improved safety for HepG2 cells, and nontarget organism earthworms. This research provides insight into creating safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly pesticide production to reduce manual operation times and labor costs.

Nanopesticide research, introduced relatively recently, is an emerging field that can be defined as application of nanotechnology for crop protection. Nanopesticides have been proven to be more effective in reducing pest populations and plant infestation levels than bulk chemical pesticides.Some of the advantages that nanopesticide formulations present are increased solubility of water-insoluble active ingredients, increased formulation stability, elimination of toxic organic solvents when compared to conventional pesticides, the ability to release active ingredients gradually, enhanced stability to prevent early degradation, increased mobility and higher pesticidal activity due to smaller particle size, and a larger surface area that may lengthen their shelf life. Furthermore, the nanopesticides we're interested in are synthesized using plant-based substances, making them promising alternatives to traditional pest control chemicals. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) play an important role in human nutrition due to their high nutritional value. However, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, harmful insect species and mites can limit and reduce their production. In the current paper, we present the framework on which plant based nanopesticide technology is based, as well as the various techniques for determining nanoparticle properties. We highlight the potential for several medicinal and aromatic plants from the Khenifra region in Morocco to be used in the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles. We also reviewed the use of metal nanoparticles in crop protection, emphasizing the control of green bean’s pests and disease, while compiling numerous research that demonstrate their effectiveness.

Even less-explored are the effects of commercial insecticides formulated with more than one active product. Short- and long-term lethal and sublethal effects were studied for the first time on the progeny of commercial formulations of spirotetramat, imidacloprid and a commercial mixture of these active ingredients on pupae of Diaeretiella rapae (M'ntosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), an endoparasitoid of aphids considered to be a potential biological control agent. Insecticides were exposed topically on aphid mummies in which the parasitoid was in the pupal stage. RESULTS: Imidacloprid reduced adult emergence by more than 30% and prolonged intra-host development time with respect to control from half the maximum recommended field dose (MFRD). Spirotetramat and commercial mixture only showed significant effects on these endpoints at doses above the MFRD. The tested formulations did not affect adult longevity, sex ratio, and percentage of parasitism in the exposed generation. At low concentrations the active ingredients in the commercial mixture behave synergistically, whereas at medium and high concentrations they behave antagonistically. Considering the 10% lethal dose (LD10), imidacloprid showed the highest hazard coefficient, whereas the commercial mixture was more hazardous when considering the LD50 and LD90. The commercial mixture and imidacloprid induced higher adult emergence and altered the sex ratio in the progeny. CONCLUSIONS: The following order of toxicity on D. rapae can be established: imidacloprid > commercial mixture > spirotetramat.

Although GLY/GBH was previously considered to be non-toxic, growing evidence indicates that GLY/GBH negatively affects some animal taxa. However, there has been no systematic analysis quantifying its toxicity to animals. Therefore, we used a meta-analytical approach to determine whether there is a demonstrable effect of GLY/GBH toxicity across animals. We further addressed whether the effects of GLY/GBH vary due to (1) taxon (invertebrate vs. vertebrate), (2) habitat (aquatic vs. terrestrial), (3) type of biological response (behavior vs. physiology vs. survival), and (4) dosage or concentration of GLY/GBH. Using this approach, we also determined whether adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) in commercial formulations of GBHs increased toxicity for animals relative to exposure to GLY alone. We analyzed 1282 observations from 121 articles. We conclude that GLY is generally sub-lethally toxic for animals, particularly for animals in aquatic or marine habitats, and that toxicity did not exhibit dose-dependency. Yet, our analyses detected evidence for widespread publication bias so we encourage continued experimental investigations to better understand factors influencing GLY/GBH toxicity to animals. © 2024 The Authors",NA,"230"

The use of pesticide carriers to deliver pesticides can help to prevent rapid release, assist in targeted release, and improve pesticide utilization. However, after completing pesticide delivery, less part of pesticide carriers has more functions and may remain in the environment, leading to material waste and environmental burden. Here, we propose that the environment-friendly carrier materials for pesticide delivery can synergistically enhance control efficacy with pesticides. Based on the bio-stimulant polyglutamic acid, amphiphilic polymers (mPEG-b-PLG) were constructed, and they assembled into nano micelle. After encapsulating prothioconazole (PTC) into the nano micelle through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions through co-assembly, mPEG-b-PLG-PTC nanospheres with a diameter of approximately 120 nm were prepared. The nanospheres exhibit pH responsiveness for targeted release of pesticides, as well as excellent retention capacity, droplet bounce inhibition ability, and deposition capacity. At the same time, compared with commercial formulations, it has long-term antifungal properties and lower EC50, while its acute toxicity to human cells is lower, which can reduce cell apoptosis by about 63 %. It is also gratifying that the main root length, plant height, and fresh weight of wheat seedlings treated with mPEG-b-PLG have significantly improved, effectively applying carrier materials for synergistic effects.

In addition, the impact of fungicides and surfactants on rice seed germination were determined. Furthermore, phenamacril and fludioxonil were selected as the active components of suspension concentrate for seed coating. The antifungal activity of phenamacril against F. moniliforme Sheldon was 0.139 mg/L and fludioxonil against C. lunata was 0.110 mg/L. PEG-2000 was selected as the surfactant due to its promoting effect on rice seedling. Based on the above findings, 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS was developed via the wet sand grinding method. The toxicity of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS to zebrafish was verified, and field experiments were conducted in five different regions of the Yangtze River Basin. The results indicated minimal toxicity of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS to zebrafish. Relative to the control agent consisting of 6.25% phenamacril metalaxyl-M FS, 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS showed better control effect and exhibited superior efficacy in promoting growth and increasing yield in all five regions. Specifically, the control effect of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS on bakanae exceeded 84.83% with the highest yield increasing value recorded at 30.48%. Currently, the market offers a limited selection of suspension concentrate for seed coating of rice. The findings of this study may offer a viable alternative formulation and directions for further research concerning the application of suspension concentrate for seed coating of rice.

Pesticide mixtures containing insecticide methomyl are commonly used in agriculture. However, the interaction of their active ingredients in a mixture has been insufficiently studied. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the nature of the combined action of a mixture of insecticides methomyl (carbamate) and bifenthrin (pyrethroid) using various methods: a classical model (orthogonal planning of the experiment using nonlinear variables); a generalized linear regression model for the binomial distribution (probit regression); and an isobologram. The study was conducted at the Federal Scientific Center of Hygiene named after F.F. Erisman of the Federal Service for Supervision in Protection of the Rights of Consumer and Man Wellbeing, according to the protocol approved by the local bioethical commission. Materials and methods. Ninety male outbred rats were administered 9 combined doses of the insecticides (combinations of LD16, LD33 and LD50 for the individual compounds, as devised from a preliminary study). Results. Impaired coordination, tremor of the limbs and head, turning into convulsions, rapid (shallow) breathing were observed in all groups. The data on mortality as used to construct 2 mathematical models, as well as to construct an isobologram. Limitations. The study was limited to studying the indicators of acute oral toxicity, without taking into account the possible repeated exposure. Conclusion. The models showed that the additive effect for the combination of methomyl and bifenthrin was only observed for combinations when the individual dose of bifenthrin was equal to or greater than 45 mg/kg b.w. (LD33) and the dose of methomyl was less than 30 mg/kg b.w., as all animals receiving a dose of 30 mg/kg b.w. of methomyl (LD50) in the mixture died. Therefore, the dose of methomyl dictated the toxic effect of the mixture, which should be accounted for in hygienic regulation of methomyl-containing formulations. © 2024 Federal Scientific Center of Hygiene named after FF Erisman.

The advantage of using nanoagrochemicals compared to conventional ones is that to achieve the same biological effect, a quantitatively smaller amount of active ingredient can be used, and when using encapsulation of the active agent or its adsorption on a suitable nanocarrier, its controlled prolonged release can be achieved, which at the same time reduces the adverse impact on the environment. Nanoagrochemicals are also generally less toxic than conventional agrochemicals, however, some of them can be more toxic to aquatic flora and fauna even at sublethal concentrations.

This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity.

Materials and methods. The 3RIVE 3D innovative technological system of introducing was used to applicate Brigade 3Rive 3D, SC formulation. Field experiments on the study of working conditions when using the pesticide were conducted in various soil and climatic regions of Eastern Europe. Statistical processing of the results was carried out using a package of licensed statistical programs IBM SPSS StatisticsBase v.22 and MS Excel. Research results and discussion. During the conducted research, no bifenthrin contamination was found on the open skin of the operator and the tractor driver, who were processing corn crops with the Brigade 3Rive 3D, SC formulation. However, the operator’s gloves were found to contain 0.025 mg of bifenthrin. Calculation of the unitless CASd value on the possibility of skin acute effects when applying the formulation showed that bifenthrin and the Brigade 3Rive 3D, SC formulation based on it are characterized by sufficient selectivity of action on the target object (CASd – 645 and 162, respectively, i.e. > 100) and a low level of danger acute dermal toxic effects for workers, which is due to low values of effective consumption rates. The real dermal risk of bifenthrin exposure when using the Brigade 3Rive3D, SC formulation was significantly lower compared to the risk of workers involved in «traditional» air treatment and treatment with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (p=0.009-0.048 according to Wilcoxon’s W-criterion); in comparison with rod and fan processing – it is non-significantly lower (р=0.262-1.000).

Self-assembly nanotechnology is a promising strategy by which to develop novel nano-formulations for pesticides. Nano-formulations improve the effective utilization of pesticides and reduce risks to the environment because of their eco-friendly preparation, high drug loading, and desirable physicochemical properties. Here, to enhance the utilization efficiency of myclobutanil (MYC) and develop a novel nano-formulation, carrier-free co-assembled nanoparticles (MT NPs) based on MYC and tannic acid (TA) were prepared by noncovalent molecular interactions using a green preparation process without any additives. Results: The results showed that the prepared spherical nanoparticles had good stability in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions, low surface tension (40.53 mN m−1), high rainfastness, and good maximum retention values on plant leaves. Release of active ingredients from MT NPs could be regulated by altering the molar ratio of subassemblies in the co-assembly and the pH of the environment. Antifungal experiments demonstrated that MT NPs had better activities against Alternaria alternata and Fusarium graminearum [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 6.40 and 77.08 mg/L] compared with free MYC (EC50 = 11.46 and 124.82 mg/L), TA (EC50 = 251.19 and 503.81 mg/L), and an MYC + TA mixture (EC50 = 9.62 and 136.21 mg/L). These results suggested that MYC and TA incorporated in the co-assembled nanoparticles had a synergistic antifungal activity. The results of a genotoxicity assessment indicated that MT NPs could reduce the genotoxicity of MYC to plant cells. Conclusion: Co-assembled MT NPs with synergistic antifungal activity have outstanding potential for the management of plant diseases. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,"419"

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called “inert” co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable. © 2023, The Author(s).",NA,"438"

Cinnamaldehyde is found in cinnamon essential oil and has good antifungal activity, but cinnamaldehyde also has negative characteristics such as high volatility, poor water solubility and easy oxidative degradation, which seriously hinder the potential of its antimicrobial properties and its application in agriculture. In this study, the effects of the surfactant ratio, concentration and emulsification method on the stability of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions were systematically investigated by observing the sample appearance, mean droplet size and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results showed that the optimal formula of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsion was a surfactant (R5:848) ratio of 1:1 and a concentration of 7%, and the emulsification method was E1: adding dropwise aqueous phase (deionized water) to the oil phase (cinnamaldehyde + surfactant).

This required the introduction of environment- and public health-friendly advanced technologies for plant protection to guard yields from pest destruction in a sustainable way. Encapsulation technology is a promising procedure to increase the effectiveness of pesticide active ingredients while reducing human exposure and environmental impact. Despite the presumed favorable properties of encapsulated pesticide formulations on human health, it is necessary to systematically assess whether they are less harmful to human health than conventional pesticide products. Objectives: We aim to systematically review the literature to answer the question of whether micro- or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulations exert different degrees of toxicity than their conventional (not-encapsulated) counterparts in in vivo animal and in vitro (human, animal, and bacterial cell) non-target models. The answer is important to estimate the possible differences in the toxicological hazards of the two different types of pesticide formulations. Because our extracted data will come from different models, we also aim to perform subgroup analyses to investigate how toxicity varies across different models. A pooled toxicity effect estimate will also be performed by meta-analysis when appropriate. Methods: The systematic review will follow the guidelines developed by the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT). The protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement. PubMed (NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), Embase (Elsevier), and Agricola (EBSCOhost) electronic databases will be comprehensively searched in September 2022 to identify eligible studies using multiple search terms of “pesticide”, “encapsulation” and “toxicity” along with their synonyms and other words that are semantically related. The reference lists of all eligible articles and retrieved reviews will be manually screened to identify additional relevant papers. Eligibility criteria: We will include peer-reviewed experimental (non-target in vivo animal model and in vitro human, animal, and bacterial cell cultures) studies published as full-text articles in English language that simultaneously investigate the effect of any micro- or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulation, applied in all ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure, and its corresponding active ingredient(s) or its conventional non-encapsulated product formulation(s) used in the same ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure on the same pathophysiological outcome. We will exclude studies that examine pesticidal activity on target organisms, cultures of cells isolated from target organisms exposed in vivo or in vitro, and those using biological materials isolated from target organisms/cells. Study appraisal and synthesis: Studies identified by the search will be screened and managed according to the review inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Covidence systematic review tool by two reviewers, who will also blindly extract the data and assess the risk of bias of included studies. The OHAT risk of bias tool will be applied to evaluate the quality and risk of bias in the included studies. Study findings will be synthesized narratively by important features of the study populations, design, exposure, and endpoints.

Surfactants can promote the bioavailability of organic compounds for enhanced microbial degradation, but the performance depends on soil and surfactant properties, sorption-desorption equilibria of contaminants and surfactants, and possible adverse effects of surfactants on microorganisms. This study investigated the influence of five surfactants [e.g., Triton X-100 (TX-100), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA), Aerosol 22 and Tween 80] on the sorption-desorption, degradation, and mobility of CTL and OH-CTL in two volcanic and one non-volcanic soil. Sorption and desorption of fungicides depended on the sorption of surfactants on soils, surfactants' capacity to neutralize the net negative charge of soils, surfactants’ critical micellar concentration, and pH of soils. HDTMA was strongly adsorbed on soils, which shifted the fungicide sorption equilibria by increasing the distribution coefficient (Kd) values. Contrarily, SDS and TX-100 lowered CTL and OH-CTL sorption on soils by decreasing the Kd values, which resulted in an efficient extraction of the fungicide compounds from soil. SDS increased the degradation of CTL, especially in the non-volcanic soil (DT50 values were 14 and 7 days in natural and amended soils, with final residues <7% of the initial dose), whereas TX-100 enabled an early start and sustenance of OH-CTL degradation in all soils. CTL and OH-CTL stimulated soil microbial activities without noticeable deleterious effects of the surfactants. SDS and TX-100 also reduced the vertical transport of OH-CTL in soils.

However, when phosmet was added to the 3% Samaritá Tradicional bait, the mortality was only 3.9% (class 1 - harmless), similar to the toxicity observed for the Success 0.02 CB ready-to-use bait (0.24 g a.i. spinosad/l) (<5% mortality). Although toxic baits were formulated with spinosyn-based insecticides, all toxic bait formulations were classified as harmless or slightly harmful (<50% mortality) to D. areolatus, with the exception of 1.5% Ceratrap + spinetoram and 7% Sugarcane molasses + spinosad (≈ 60% mortality - moderately harmful). In addition, these formulations did not show sublethal effects in reducing the parasitism and emergence rate of the F1 generation of D. areolatus in A. fraterculus larvae.

Scientific diaspora has already established that a significant amount of the pesticide is not being used by the crops and finds its way into the environment through leaching, evaporation, sorption etc., leading to adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology is bringing a revolutionary change in agriculture through effective pest management. The main purpose of introducing nano-pesticides is to reduce the indiscriminate use of conventional pesticides and their harmful impacts on the environment. Nano-formulations can improve the efficiency of pesticides by enhancing permeability, solubility, and stability along-with controlling their release profile and protecting them from premature degradation. The present review is accordingly assembled to significantly investigate the developmental updates of nano-pesticides since the past decades, their ultimate fate, ecotoxicological risks and betterment over their conventional analogues. Nano-pesticides including nanomaterials as active ingredients, nano-encapsulations, nano-emulsions, nano-suspensions are discussed. Additionally, critical information and the foreseeable research gaps in this emerging area are highlighted. Currently, there is a dearth of fundamental knowledge about how nano-formulations will behave in the environment. It is still unclear whether they will genuinely produce noticeable benefits or represent a new class of hazards. Very scanty information is available on their ecotoxicological behaviour, guidelines, and policymaking for their safer use globally. Introducing these smart nano-formulations within the domain of the current pesticide regulatory frameworks is still under debate. Thus, a discussion of the pros and cons of nano-pesticides is of prime importance for justifying their status of cleaner production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",NA,"539"

However, knowledge about their environmental interactions is still very limited. In a recent study, efforts were made to compare the soil fate and bioaccumulation of four model nanopesticides (namely, chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole loaded on polymeric and lipid nanocarriers) relative to the conventional formulations and pure active ingredients in containing earthworms and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in two soils over a period of 4 months. These nanoformulations increased the soil half-life of the pesticides by twofold as a direct consequence of the slow release of the pesticide. Pesticide bioaccumulation in earthworms was often increased, probably as a result of their enhanced bioavailability. The pesticide bioaccumulation was also shown to affect plants, but with an inconsistent trend. Overall, the microcosmic results demonstrated that nanoformulations can significantly alter the fate and bioavailability of pesticides. However, generalisations are still difficult to make as the impacts depend on the type of nanocarrier, pesticide, soil used, and time scale.

This required the introduction of environment-and public health-friendly advanced technologies for plant protection to guard yields from pest destruction in a sustainable way. Encapsulation technology is a promising procedure to increase the effectiveness of pesticide active ingredients while reducing human exposure and environmental impact. Despite the presumed favorable properties of encapsulated pesticide formulations on human health, it is necessary to systematically assess whether they are less harmful to human health than conventional pesticide products.Objectives: We aim to systematically review the literature to answer the question of whether micro-or nano -encapsulated pesticide formulations exert different degrees of toxicity than their conventional (not -encapsu-lated) counterparts in in vivo animal and in vitro (human, animal, and bacterial cell) non-target models. The answer is important to estimate the possible differences in the toxicological hazards of the two different types of pesticide formulations. Because our extracted data will come from different models, we also aim to perform subgroup analyses to investigate how toxicity varies across different models. A pooled toxicity effect estimate will also be performed by meta-analysis when appropriate. Methods: The systematic review will follow the guidelines developed by the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/OHAT). The protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement. PubMed (NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), Embase (Elsevier), and Agricola (EBSCOhost) electronic databases will be comprehensively searched in September 2022 to identify eligible studies using multiple search terms of ""pesti-cide"", ""encapsulation"" and ""toxicity"" along with their synonyms and other words that are semantically related. The reference lists of all eligible articles and retrieved reviews will be manually screened to identify additional relevant papers.Eligibility criteria: We will include peer-reviewed experimental (non-target in vivo animal model and in vitro human, animal, and bacterial cell cultures) studies published as full-text articles in English language that simultaneously investigate the effect of any micro-or nano-encapsulated pesticide formulation, applied in all ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure, and its corresponding active ingredient(s) or its conventional non-encapsulated product formulation(s) used in the same ranges of concentrations, duration, and routes of exposure on the same pathophysiological outcome. We will exclude studies that examine pesticidal activity on target organisms, cultures of cells isolated from target organisms exposed in vivo or in vitro, and those using biological materials isolated from target organisms/cells. Study appraisal and synthesis: Studies identified by the search will be screened and managed according to the review inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Covidence systematic review tool by two reviewers, who will also blindly extract the data and assess the risk of bias of included studies. The OHAT risk of bias tool will be applied to evaluate the quality and risk of bias in the included studies.

Nano-formulations can improve the efficiency of pesticides by enhancing permeability, solubility, and stability along-with controlling their release profile and protecting them from premature degra-dation. The present review is accordingly assembled to significantly investigate the developmental updates of nano-pesticides since the past decades, their ultimate fate, ecotoxicological risks and betterment over their conventional analogues. Nano-pesticides including nanomaterials as active ingredients, nano-encapsulations, nano-emulsions, nano-suspensions are discussed. Additionally, critical information and the foreseeable research gaps in this emerging area are highlighted. Currently, there is a dearth of fundamental knowledge about how nano-formulations will behave in the environment. It is still unclear whether they will genuinely produce noticeable benefits or represent a new class of hazards. Very scanty information is available on their ecotoxi-cological behaviour, guidelines, and policymaking for their safer use globally. Introducing these smart nano-formulations within the domain of the current pesticide regulatory frameworks is still under debate. Thus, a discussion of the pros and cons of nano-pesticides is of prime importance for justifying their status of cleaner production.",NA,"671"

Self-assembly nanotechnology is a promising strategy by which to develop novel nano-formulations for pesticides. Nano-formulations improve the effective utilization of pesticides and reduce risks to the environment because of their eco-friendly preparation, high drug loading, and desirable physicochemical properties. Here, to enhance the utilization efficiency of myclobutanil (MYC) and develop a novel nano-formulation, carrier-free co-assembled nanoparticles (MT NPs) based on MYC and tannic acid (TA) were prepared by noncovalent molecular interactions using a green preparation process without any additives. ResultsThe results showed that the prepared spherical nanoparticles had good stability in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions, low surface tension (40.53 mN m(-1)), high rainfastness, and good maximum retention values on plant leaves. Release of active ingredients from MT NPs could be regulated by altering the molar ratio of subassemblies in the co-assembly and the pH of the environment. Antifungal experiments demonstrated that MT NPs had better activities against Alternaria alternata and Fusarium graminearum [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 6.40 and 77.08 mg/L] compared with free MYC (EC50 = 11.46 and 124.82 mg/L), TA (EC50 = 251.19 and 503.81 mg/L), and an MYC + TA mixture (EC50 = 9.62 and 136.21 mg/L). These results suggested that MYC and TA incorporated in the co-assembled nanoparticles had a synergistic antifungal activity. The results of a genotoxicity assessment indicated that MT NPs could reduce the genotoxicity of MYC to plant cells. ConclusionCo-assembled MT NPs with synergistic antifungal activity have outstanding potential for the management of plant diseases. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",NA,"685"

The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii is a polyphagous pest that can cause large crop yield losses. Here, we tested the effects of three fungicides, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and chlorothalonil, on the fitness and Buchnera endosymbiont of A. gossypii. ResultsThe formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, and the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin produced dose-dependent mortality in A. gossypii, whereas there was no dose-dependent mortality for chlorothalonil. The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin significantly reduced the lifespan and fecundity of A. gossypii, and increased the density of Buchnera in the parental generation but not the (unexposed) F-1. When the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin was tested, the lifespan of the F-0 generation was also reduced, but the density of Buchnera was not, indicating that non-insecticidal chemicals in the fungicide formulation may affect the density of the endosymbiont of A. gossypii.

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called ""inert"" co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable.",NA,"705"

Numerous studies have suggested that nanopesticides could soon fully replace conventional pesticides since they are far more effective than those now in use. Due to an increase in their surface-to-volume ratio, nanomaterials exhibit different properties from their bulk counterparts. Nanopesticides are pesticides that have been made with these nanoparticles and have a high application efficiency and significantly fewer hazardous environmental impacts than pesticides that have been made chemically. Various formulation strategies, which include the containment of the active substance by the nanoparticles, have previously been established, exhibiting promising effects on the pests. Target specificity, high stability, and controlled active ingredients (AIs) release are a few of the noteworthy qualities these nanopesticides offer. The development of green nanopesticides derived from nature, which have very low ecotoxicities and nanoscale qualities, can also have a significant positive impact on crop output. However, before being mass-produced and used, the discovery still has to be thoroughly examined to determine its effects on people and the environment due to the lack of conclusive proof demonstrating its toxicity. This paper aims to represent the use of nanopesticides in crop protection and a detailed overview of the various methods for the formulation of nanopesticides.

However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay.Methodology/Principal findingsUsing standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifically enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides.Conclusions/SignificanceOur findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. Monitoring the susceptibility of insect populations to chemical insecticides provides vital information for resistance management. New chemicals are being tested and added to the arsenal used for malaria prevention. As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) standard operating procedure for testing insecticide susceptibility in adult mosquitoes has been updated to include new active ingredients. To evaluate their susceptibility to clothianidin, a neonicotinoid or to flupyradifurone, a butenolide, adult mosquitoes are not exposed to the active ingredient alone, but to a mixture containing a surfactant which helps to solubilize the pesticide. In the present study, we report that surfactants such as vegetable oil esters or soap can enhance the potency of some active ingredients. Because of this synergistic action, the actual level of susceptibility of the insect populations tested can be largely overestimated. However, the results also reveal that some affordable products such as soaps can enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoids against mosquitoes. Although it remains unclear how soaps can be used as an adjuvant in insecticide formulations applied against mosquitoes, their potential utility warrants further investigations.",NA,"739"

The primary aim of adjuvant products is to increase the spreading and sticking of spray droplets and to increase the penetration of active ingredients through the cuticles of leaves or targeted pests, which can reduce the amount of active ingredient needed for effective pest control. Adjuvants are made up of compounds drawn from the ""inert ingredient"" list maintained by EPA but are identified as ""principal functioning agents"" when used in adjuvant products. These inert compounds do not undergo the same testing and risk assessment process that is required of pesticide active ingredients and generally have no mitigation measures that prevent application onto crops during bloom at times of day when bees are foraging. Honey bees (Apis mellifera;Hymenoptera:Apidae) are at an increased risk of exposure to adjuvant tank mixtures while providing agricultural pollination services. Colony losses attributed to pesticide applications thought to have low risk to honey bees have been reported, highlighting the need to better understand the toxicity of adjuvants included in pesticide tank mixtures. This review summarizes current literature on the risks posed to honey bees by agricultural adjuvants and tank mix combinations of adjuvants with pesticides.

Followed by measuring pesticidal activity, ecotoxicity of prepared formulation was investigated. The plant consortium was prepared from the selected plant extracts through green science principles. The presence of possible bioactive compounds in plant consortium prepared from ethanolic extracts of selected plants was determined using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Pesticidal activity of the prepared consortium was investigated against S. litura by determination of cumulative mortality, lethal concentration. Active principles of pesticidal activity associated with plant consortium was readily extracted in ethanol. Prepared consortium revealed notable pesticidal activity against S. litura larval stages by recording high mortality and least LC50 and LC90.

The use of pesticide carriers to deliver pesticides can help to prevent rapid release, assist in targeted release, and improve pesticide utilization. However, after completing pesticide delivery, less part of pesticide carriers has more functions and may remain in the environment, leading to material waste and environmental burden. Here, we propose that the environment -friendly carrier materials for pesticide delivery can synergistically enhance control efficacy with pesticides. Based on the bio-stimulant polyglutamic acid, amphiphilic polymers (mPEG-b-PLG) were constructed, and they assembled into nano micelle. After encapsulating prothioconazole (PTC) into the nano micelle through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions through co -assembly, mPEG-b-PLG-PTC nanospheres with a diameter of approximately 120 nm were prepared. The nanospheres exhibit pH responsiveness for targeted release of pesticides, as well as excellent retention capacity, droplet bounce inhibition ability, and deposition capacity. At the same time, compared with commercial formulations, it has long-term antifungal properties and lower EC50, while its acute toxicity to human cells is lower, which can reduce cell apoptosis by about 63 %. It is also gratifying that the main root length, plant height, and fresh weight of wheat seedlings treated with mPEG-b-PLG have significantly improved, effectively applying carrier materials for synergistic effects. In summary, this work proposes a promising strategy to synergize pesticide carrier materials as active ingredients, providing new ideas for the integration of pesticide and fertilizer, improving pesticide utilization efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution.",NA,"842"

Currently, herbicides are primarily applied for weed management. However, the effectiveness of herbicide deposition and uptake on barnyardgrass is limited as a consequence of the high wax content on leaves, low water solubility and extreme lipophilicity of herbicides. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel formulations for efficient delivery of herbicides to improve herbicidal activity and reduce dosage.RESULTSWe successfully prepared nanosuspension(s) (NS) of quinclorac through the wet media milling technique. This NS demonstrates excellent physical stability and maintains nanoscale during dose transfer. The deposition concentration and uptake concentration of NS on barnyardgrass were 3.84-4.47- and 2.11-2.58-fold greater than those traditional formulations, respectively. Moreover, the NS exhibited enhanced herbicidal activity against barnyardgrass at half the dosage required by conventional formulations without compromising rice safety.CONCLUSIONSThese findings suggest that NS can effectively facilitate the delivery of hydrophobic and poorly water-soluble herbicide active ingredients, thereby enhancing their deposition, uptake and bioactivity.

While regulatory risk assessments primarily focus on the active ingredients, recent research indicates ecotoxicological impacts of commercial preparations on non-target organisms, particularly within the soil ecosystem where key species such as earthworms play a vital role in maintaining soil quality and fertility. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the long-term effects of the following respective commercial preparations: the insecticides Sumialfa (esfenvalerate) and Calypso (thiacloprid), as well as the herbicides Frontier (dimethenamid-p) and Filon (prosulfocarb) on the earthworm Eisenia andrei in standardized soil during long-term exposures of 7, 14, and 28 days. To study the possible effects on different levels of biological organization, enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CES) glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx); non-enzymatic biomarkers: multixenobiotic resistance activity (MXR), levels of glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as reproductive success were investigated. While Calypso appeared to be the least toxic substance, all pesticides showed significant effect on multiobiomarker response in E. fetida. That being said, the response of MXR activity was significantly altered by all tested pesticides indicating MXR being the most sensitive endpoint of the present research. Recovery of MXR was observed after 28 days, however, only in case of exposure to Filon, while the recovery of CAT activity was recorded after 28 days as well, subsequent to Sumialfa exposure. Reproductive success was negatively impacted regarding the Frontier and Sumialfa exposure at the highest concentration (100 mg/kg) reflected in reduced number of cocoons, while only the exposure to Frontier (100 mg/kg) reduced the number of juveniles. Based on the results, it is important to include commercial pesticide formulations in pesticide risk assessments.

Adults exposed to LC10 and LC30 of lambda-cyhalothrin, and LC30 of deltamethrin exhibited prolonged periods on their backs compared to the remaining treatments and the controls. The alpha-cypermethrin LC30-exposed adults exhibited significantly shorter walking and stopping durations than controls but demonstrated prolonged climbing on the arena walls compared to adults exposed to the remaining a.i. and the control.

Conversely, nearly 100% mortality was observed when test insects were exposed to dry neonicotinoid residues on leaf discs and glass plate surfaces. On the other hand, dry residues of the pyrethroid bifenthrin on filter paper, leaf disks, and glass plates killed significantly more test insects when compared to untreated groups.

The results indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides applied to filter paper were adsorbed. Toxic compounds possibly move in between and binding to paper fibers so that no toxic residues were left on treated surfaces. However, adsorbed insecticides were still biologically active when washed out of filter paper and dried on an inert glass surface.

It damages plants by secreting large amounts of oxalic acid and cell wall-degrading enzymes. To meet this challenge, we designed a new pH/enzyme dual-responsive nanopesticide Pro@ZnO@Pectin (PZP). This nanopesticide uses zinc oxide (ZnO) as a carrier of prochloraz (Pro) and is encapsulated with pectin. When encountering oxalic acid released by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the acidic environment promotes the decomposition of ZnO; at the same time, the pectinase produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can also decompose the outer pectin layer of PZP, thereby promoting the effective release of the active ingredient. Experimental data showed that PZP was able to achieve an efficient release rate of 57.25% and 68.46% when pectinase was added or under acidic conditions, respectively. In addition, in vitro tests showed that the antifungal effect of PZP was comparable to that of the commercial Pro (Pro SC) on the market, and its efficacy was 1.40 times and 1.32 times that of the Pro original drug (Pro TC), respectively. Crucially, the application of PZP significantly alleviated the detrimental impacts of Pro on wheat development. Soil wetting experiments have proved that PZP primarily remained in the soil, thereby decreasing its likelihood of contaminating water sources and reducing potential risks to non-target organisms. Moreover, PZP improved the foliar wettability of Pro, lowering the contact angle to 75.06 degrees.

Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs.

As organosiloxane residues detected in environment (especially in water, sludge/soil and other environmental samples, aquatic food chain, as well as human tissues), their impacts on agricultural ecological environment are increasingly exposed due to the widely application of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, while the environmental risks from silicone-based agrochemical adjuvants, including ecotoxicity and environmental safety risks, have also attracted great concern. In recent years, volatile cyclomethylcyclosiloxanes (such as D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), D5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) and D6 (dodecylcyclohexasiloxane)) have been recognized as emerging organic pollutants, or listed as priority controlled chemicals by EU and other countries, because of their environmental persistence, bioaccumulation and potential toxicity. Based on the relevant scientific research literatures published since 1991 on the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants and the ecological environmental safety risks in the use of organosiloxane-based adjuvant (including organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants), this paper reviewed and analyzed the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and their impacts directly or indirectly on agricultural ecological environmental safety. This review mainly focused on the following two aspects: (1) the organosiloxane residues in environment and their impacts on the agricultural ecological environment safety, including organosiloxane residues and fates in the process of wastewater treatment, aquatic food chain pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in water, soil ecological pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in sludge, and human health risks from organosiloxane residues in food; (2) the current situation and environmental safety risks for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, including organosiloxane residues and ecotoxicity risks from siloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, and the management for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants. This paper also discussed the management status and problems associated with siloxane-based products. For organosiloxane as agrochemical adjuvants, organosiloxane-based adjuvants were largely assumed to be “biologically inert”, and usually no risk assessment (such as ecotoxicity test and environmental monitoring) was required. Also, the adjuvant inert ingredients were generally protected as “trade-secrets” or confidential business information, and the inert ingredients were rarely identified on product labels. At present, there are no regulatory requirements for the use of organosilicone-based adjuvants in fertilizer products as agrochemical adjuvants (such as foliar fertilizer additives) in China, posing potential environmental safety risks. This paper discussed that over-addition with organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants might increase their residues in soil-crop-water systems, and their ecotoxicity risks, as well as potential threats to food safety and human health. It is suggested that relevant management and research units need to pay more attention to environmental monitoring for organosiloxane residues and fates in the application process of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and especially strengthen the research on the impacts of organosiloxane residues from organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants on water, soil, animal and plant growth, as well as human health. © 2024 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Non-dietary risk assessments involve estimating the amount of residue which can be transferred from plant foliage to the skin or clothes, known as dislodgeable foliar residues (DFRs). DFR data are less available than crop residue data as studies are costly and limited by seasonality. European regulatory authorities are reticent to allow extrapolation of study data to different scenarios as the contributory factors have hitherto been poorly identified. This study is the first to use a new laboratory DFR method to investigate how one such factor, pesticide formulation, may affect DFR on a variety of crops. The study used the active substance difenoconazole as both an emulsifiable concentrate (EC 10%) and a wettable powder (WP 10%) with and without adjuvants (Tween 20 and organophosphate tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate TEHP) on tomato, French bean and oilseed rape. A comparable DFR% was retained from the WP and EC formulation on most crops except for tomato, where lower DFR% was retained in the case of WP (39 ± 4.7%) compared to EC (60 ± 1.2%). No significant effect of adjuvant addition was observed for either formulation except when mixing TEHP (0.1% w/v) to the EC 10% on French bean, resulting in 8% DFR reduction compared to the EC formulation alone.

Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate – Roundup®], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity. Taken altogether, the results highlight the importance of testing the impact of multiple agrochemicals (i.e. not just insecticides) through different routes of exposure in order to understand more comprehensively the potential risks for Apis and non-Apis bees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,"1029"

Since the development of 2,4-D resistant transgenic crops, it has been described as one of the most widely distributed pollutants in the world, increasing concern about its environmental impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the antioxidant system response in animals exposed to 2,4-D by different routes of exposure. It focused on determining if tissue, phylogenetic group, and herbicide formulation would influence the antioxidant mechanisms. A careful literature search of Scopus, WoS, and Science Direct retrieved 6983, 24,098, and 20,616 articles, respectively. The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses. In summary, orally exposed animals exhibited a clear decrease in enzyme activities, transgenerational exposure elicited tissue-specific prompted biochemical reductions, and topical exposure induced increased responses, emphasizing the need for unbiased exploration of the effects of 2,4-D on biomarkers of oxidative stress while addressing publication bias in oral and topical datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",NA,"1036"

Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs. This study demonstrates a conflict between insect pest management and Lepidoptera conservation during ornamental plant production and has implications for the conservation value of ornamentals after retail sale.",NA,"1122"

Pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represents a threat to non-target organisms, with various damages already reported in different species. However, there is controversy in studies on atrazine. The question of whether atrazine increases animal mortality is not yet clearly resolved. In this context, this study aimed to carry out a meta-analytic review, focusing on studies on environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine to evaluate its lethal effects on various animal species. We identified and analyzed 107 datasets through a selection process that used the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. A significant increase in the mortality rate of animals exposed to environmental concentrations of atrazine was observed. Nematodes, amphibians, molluscs, insects, and fish showed increased mortality after exposure to atrazine. Animals in the larval and juvenile stages showed greater susceptibility when exposed to different concentrations of atrazine. Furthermore, both commercial and pure formulations resulted in high mortality rates for exposed animals. Atrazine and other pesticides had a synergistic effect, increasing the risk of mortality in animals. There are still many gaps to be filled, and this study can serve as a basis for future regulations involving atrazine.",NA,"1151"

Obtaining information regarding the fate of this a.i. in environmental matrices and its ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms is essential for the risk assessment of the herbicide. In this study, the effects of Merlin Flexx- and Merlin WG75 formulated isoxaflutole-based herbicide products and two selected additives (cyprosulfamide safener and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one antimicrobial agent) were investigated on Raphidocelis subcapitata in growth inhibition assays. In ecotoxicological tests, two conventional (optical density and chlorophyll-a content) and two induced fluorescence-based (Fv*/Fp: efficiency of the photosystem PSII and Rfd* changes in the observed ratio of fluorescence decrease) endpoints were determined by UV-spectrophotometer and by our FluoroMeter Module, respectively. Furthermore, dissipation of isoxaflutole alone and in its formulated products was examined by an HPLC-UV method. In ecotoxicological assays, the fluorescence-based Rfd* was observed as the most sensitive endpoint. In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole-safener-antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 +/- 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i.

The Merlin Flexx formulation (EC50 = 27.04 +/- 1.41 mg/L) was found to be approximately 50-fold less toxic than Merlin WG75, which can be explained by the different chemical characteristics and quantity of additives in them.

Since the development of 2,4-D resistant transgenic crops, it has been described as one of the most widely distributed pollutants in the world, increasing concern about its environmental impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the antioxidant system response in animals exposed to 2,4-D by different routes of exposure. It focused on determining if tissue, phylogenetic group, and herbicide formulation would influence the antioxidant mechanisms. A careful literature search of Scopus, WoS, and Science Direct retrieved 6983, 24,098, and 20,616 articles, respectively. The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses. In summary, orally exposed animals exhibited a clear decrease in enzyme activities, transgenerational exposure elicited tissue-specific prompted biochemical reductions, and topical exposure induced increased responses, emphasizing the need for unbiased exploration of the effects of 2,4-D on biomarkers of oxidative stress while addressing publication bias in oral and topical datasets.",NA,"1170"

Their mode of action is based on blocking the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme which exists in all species with mitochondria. SDH is involved in two interconnected metabolic processes for energy production: cellular respiration, where it enables the transfer of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the Krebs cycle, where it catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. In humans, inherited SDH deficiencies can induce encephalopathies and cancers. The cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the genetic inactivation of SDH have been well described in tumours, where it causes an oxidative stress, a pseudohypoxia phenotype, a metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptomic remodelling, and alterations in migration and invasion capacities of cancer cells, related to the accumulation of an oncometabolite, the succinate, following SDH inactivation. The use of SDHi fungicides has raised many questions in recent years. Their mode of action, which aims at altering mitochondrial functions essential for energy production and metabolic homeostasis, is not specific to fungi, suggesting that they could also be toxic to humans and biodiversity. The impact of SDHis on health remains largely unexplored to date on exposure and impregnation on farmers and the general population. In addition, the physicochemical properties of SDHis make them potentially persistent in soils and organisms, and a growing number of studies report toxic effects of SDHis in non -target species. The analysis of regulatory assessment reports shows that most SDHi substances induce tumours in animals, with no evidence of genotoxicity. Thus, for these substances, the mechanism of carcinogenicity have not yet been clearly established and elucidation would require developing regulatory evaluation procedures by better integrating the knowledges on carcinogenesis processes acquired over the last ten years.",NA,"1180"

Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate - Roundup & REG;], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity.
