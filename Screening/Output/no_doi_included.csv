15,1721,Lisa,YES,"ROWE, VK; HYMAS, TA","SUMMARY OF TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION ON 2,4-D AND 2,4,5-T TYPE HERBICIDES AND AN EVALUATION OF THE HAZARDS TO LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR USE",1954,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,15,622,629,NA,"The acute oral ID50 values for 2,4-D; 2,4,5-T and their various derivatives commonly used as herbicides fall in the range of 300 to 1,000 mg/kg for mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and cattle. Dogs are generally more susceptible and chicks are more tolerant of this type of material. The acute oral ID50 values for commercial formulations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T that were used in these experiments were proportional to their content of active ingredient. The ""inert ingredients"" do not appear to contribute materially to the oral toxicity of the formulations. MCP (2_methyl_4_chlorophenoxyacetic acid) and silvex (2-(2,4,5_trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid) and their herbicidal derivatives appear to be slightly less toxic than the corresponding 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T materials. The hazard to livestock and wildlife associated with the use as recommended of herbicides containing 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, MCP, and silvex is negligible. Toxic amounts of these materials can be obtained if animals have access to spray tanks or other containers.",NA,,,,,
17,1723,Lisa,YES,"PALMER, JS",TOXICITY OF METHYLURACIL + SUBSTITUTED UREA + PHENOL COMPOUNDS TO SHEEP,1964,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,145,787,+,NA,"As many as 11 daily oral doses of 6 different chemical formulations, representing 3 general categories (methyluracil and substituted urea and phenol) were given to sheep. Calculation of each dose was based on a milligram per kilogram of body weight of the active ingredient contained in commercial products. Five herbicides were given at the rate of 250 mg/kg. Following this, all compounds were given at lower dose rates to determine the relative toxicity of each formulation. Of the herbicides studied, 2 compounds, a liquid formulation of alkanolamine salts of dinitro-o-sec-butyl phenol and a wettable powder product with linuron (3[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-l-methoxy-1-methylurea) as the active ingredient, produced the most severe toxicosis to sheep. Use of these compounds in areas where sheep might be grazing should be avoided, especially where application to pastures equals or exceeds 1 qt. or 2 lb. of the active ingredient per acre, an approximate concentration of 25 mg/sq ft. In contrast, diuron (3[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-l, 1-dimethylurea) at 25 mg/kg appeared to have little toxic effect when compared with other substituted urea compounds as measured by weight changes in the sheep during the trial period.",NA,,,,,
19,1725,Lisa,YES,"HELTON, AW; ROHRBACH, KG",TRANSLOCATION OF 12 FUNGICIDAL COMPOUNDS INJECTED INTO TREES OF PRUNUS DOMESTICA,1966,PHYTOPATHOLOGY,56,933,+,NA,"A cycloheximide derivative, five 8-quinolinol compounds, one pyridinethione, one organic mercury, one organophosphate, a phenyl sydnone, four Phytoactin formulations, and an alcohol were branch injected at various concentrations into Italian prune trees. Translocation characteristics were determined by quantity absorbed, distribution of high-concentration injury symptoms, and bioassay of stem tissues from selected locations in treated trees. The results indicated that all compounds were translocated to some extent, and the performance of 8-quinolinol benzoate was outstanding. This compound was distributed throughout the tested parts of trees treated with 5000 ppm, and bioassays were successful for as long as 407 days after treatment. Structural differences among the 8-quinolinols accounted for slight differences in translocation and for prominent differences in bioassay results. The presence of methyl alcohol with 8-quinolinol benzoate accounted for similar differences for that compound. The severity of symptoms caused by the Phytoactin preparations varied inversely with the percentage of active ingredient contained in the undiluted product. This indicates that the observed phytotoxicity was not caused by the antibiotic. Bioassays of root, fruit, and leaf tissues were made from trees treated with cycloheximide thiosemicarbazone. Positive results were obtained only with leaf extracts.",NA,,,,,

When adult specimens of the springtail O. quadriocellatus were continuously exposed to the herbicide in the lab, a dose of 0.003 ml/dm2 caused a significant increase in mortality. The active ingredient of the herbicide (2,4,5-T isooctylester) and the formulation fluid itself proved to be toxic. The toxic action of the herbicide is mainly caused by direct contact; there was only a slight effect after application as a vapor. Juvenile springtails proved more susceptible than adults. The herbicide also influenced the mobility of the springtails. A high dose (0.025 ml/dm2) decreased mobility, and a low dose (0.003 ml/dm2) increased mobility. The herbicide had a repellent action on springtails; these were able to avoid treated sections of the substrate, and to escape from them. In spite of this repellency a considerable proportion of the springtails tested died, although given the opportunity to escape. They died on the treated substrate or after escape from it. The amounts of herbicide on the soil under and between black cherry shrubs after practical applications varied from 0.0005-0.017 ml/dm2. Side effects of the herbicide 2,4,5-T should be expected in the field.",NA,,,,,

Tordon 22K is the potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid and Tordon 50D is made up of 1 part triisopropanolamine salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid to 4 parts 2,4-D. There was no evidence that differences in the formulation of picloram in either herbicide influenced differences in the toxicities of these preparations to P. radiata seedlings. Wtih 1 exception (the toxicity of Tordon 22K to E. viminalis seedlings), the herbicidal effects of Tordon 22K and Tordon 50D could be explained in terms of their active constituents, picloram and 2,4-D. Tordon 22K was considerably more toxic to eucalypt seedlings than solutions containing its active ingredient, picloram.",NA,,,,,

Commerically formulated ETMT (25 EC) added directly to the seed did not reduce disease. The experimental fungicide propyl [3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbamate HCl (SN66752) applied to the seed directly or with a solvent (water, acetone, dichloromethane) reduced postemergence damping-off and mean root rot severity on surviving plants. Seed infusion with SN66752 in a solvent was more effective than direct application at 2.8 g active ingredient/kg seed.

Tissues were sampled at regular intervals after treatment and prepared for light microscopic examination. The major response of both species involved rupture and contortion of the interveinal mesophyll cells with concomitant disorganization of the bundle sheath cells. Rapid epidermal collapse occurred in redroot pigweed but not in fall panicum. The absence of adjuvants resulted in nonuniform symptom expression as herbicide droplets accumulated in depressions and along leaf margins. No other adjuvant-specific effect was observed. herbicide concentration did not alter the final response but the time-to-expression increased as concentration decreased.",NA,,,,,
64,1770,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Oxamyl,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,NA,"Oxamyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. On 25 August 2003, Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, the DAR on oxamyl to the EFSA. The peer review was initiated on 13 October 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier DuPont. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 15 December 2004 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide and insecticides as proposed by the notifier which comprises broadcast application in potato to control the potato cyst nematode as well as suppressing early aphid infestations and Spraing at application rate of 4.0 kg/ha for early potatoes or up to 5.5 kg/ha for potatoes. Analytical methods for the determination of residues of oxamyl are available for potatoes, soil, water, air and blood. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed. Oxamyl is absorbed to a high degree, without evidence of accumulation. Oxamyl is extensively metabolised and the major metabolite was IN-A2213 and minor metabolites were IN-L2953 and IND2708. The acute oral and inhalatory toxicity is high (T+; R26/28) but dermal toxicity on the other hand is low. Oxamyl was neither an irritant nor a sensitizer in skin but it was a transient eye irritant. Effects observed during short term and long exposure were clinical signs as a consequence of decreased cholinesterase activity. Oxamyl was not genotoxic or carcinogenic and the reproductive performance was not affected by oxamyl. The soil metabolites IN-A2213 and IN-D2708 are not considered as relevant. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD are all set to 0.001 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day in the acute neurotoxicity study in the rat, with a safety factor of 100. However, it should be noted that a scientifically valid human study is available, where the NOAEL is 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, which could be used for derivation of the ARfD. The dermal absorption is 0.04% for the granular formulation Oxamyl 10GR. Based on this value of dermal absorption, a treated area of 4.6 ha/day as well as a max. application rate of 5.5 kg a. s./ha, the estimated operator exposure was below AOEL according to calculations in the US PHED model when respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is applied during the loading and mixing and application procedures. The metabolism of oxamyl in potatoes after granular application to soil does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern based on the assessment of available data (refer to point 2.8). It was also demonstrated that no parent oxamyl is present in potatoes treated in this manner. Consistently, no residues of oxamyl were quantified in any of the potatoes tuber samples from field trials conducted according critical GAP. Using a residue level equal to the LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg for food of plant origin in the chronic dietary risk assessment represents a worst-case scenario and leads to estimated intakes for consumers not exceeding 73% of the proposed ADI. An acute risk for consumers from the consumption of potatoes grown according the examined representative GAP can not be stated as oxamyl residues are not present. However, EFSA notes that if oxamyl residues were present in potatoes at a level of 0.02* mg/kg then the ARfD for oxamyl of 0.001 mg/kg bw/day may be exceeded for certain consumer subgroups. In aerobic conditions degradation of oxamyl in soil yields IN-A2213 (oxamyl oxyme) that is further degraded to IN-D2708 (DMOA) and then to CO2 and unextractable soil components. Metabolite IN-N0079 (N, N-dimethyl-1-cyanoformamide) appears at relatively high levels in the soil photolysis study. This is not a photolysis metabolite and its formation is catalyzed by ferrous ion. Degradation of oxamyl in soil is strongly pH dependent, with the longer half life for the single acidic soil studied. New data to assess effect of pH in the degradation was required to the notifier. Additional data presented by the notifier on the degradation of oxamyl in acidic soils has not been fully evaluated due to late submission. Furthermore, modelling for this substance and their metabolites are necessary to fully characterize the impact of the degradation rate of oxamyl at different soil pHs. New data has been submitted in relation with this point on November 2004. Oxamyl, IN-A2213, IN-D2708 and IN-N0079 are weakly adsorbed in soil. No pH dependence is observed for any of the compounds studied. In sterile aqueous buffer solutions, hydrolysis of oxamyl is strongly pH dependent. At acidic pH the compound is stable. Metabolites IN-A2213, IN-D2708 and water sediment metabolite IN-T2921 are stable at pH 4, 7 and 9. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the degradation of oxamyl in the environment but it is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of the metabolites. Oxamyl is not readily biodegradable. In water sediment systems, major metabolites in water were IN-A2213, IN-D2708, IN-N0079 and INT2921. The cumulative amounts of CO2 evolved up to a maximum of 60.9 % AR. Only metabolite IN-D2708 was found in significant amounts in the sediment. Oxamyl degrades faster in the water phase with a half life between 0.4 and 1 day. Half life of metabolites in the total system is generally below 20 days except for IN-D2708 in one system. Potential risk for contamination of surface water and sediment by oxamyl and its metabolites IN-A2213 and IN-D2708 was assessed by FOCUS surface water modelling. Also Initial PECsw for water / sediment metabolites IN-N0079 and INT2921 has been calculated. With respect to ground water contamination, it is concluded that there may be a high risk of contamination by oxamyl and its metabolites in certain circumstances, particularly if application is made on acidic soils that have not been fully assessed. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, soil micro-organisms, terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is low with respect to oxamyl and the metabolites as far as investigated. The risk to aquatic organisms can be considered low for all the drainage scenarios and the run-off pond scenario. For the 3 run-off stream scenarios from the FOCUSsw step 3 scenarios evaluated, the trigger was still breached indicating a high risk to aquatic organisms under these circumstances. Risk mitigation measures need to be taken into account at MS level to address this risk. The aquatic risk assessment has been conducted on the assumption that direct contamination (i. e. 'drift' of small granules) of surface water is not possible. A restriction highlighting the need to avoid the use of application machinery (i. e. pressurised systems) that may result in direct contamination of adjacent surface waters is proposed. A high risk to birds and mammals from the use of oxamyl and the need to address this risk further was identified. A full risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. Also the long term risk to earthworms is considered high as the TER (breaches the Annex VI trigger value of 5. The need to address this risk further was identified.",NA,,,,,
65,1771,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,NA,"Fluoxastrobin is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 United Kingdom received an application from Bayer AG for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/35/EC of 10 January 2003 2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on fluoxastrobin, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 2 September 2003. The peer review was initiated on 14 October 2003 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. Following the request by the EU-Commission further evaluations provided by the rapporteur Member State were discussed in meetings of experts in Parma in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 20 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The outcome of the experts' discussion in March 2007 and the subsequent revision of the conclusion of fluoxastrobin were discussed with representatives from Member States on 26 April 2007. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control a range of fungal diseases in wheat, rye and barley at application rate up 200 g fluoxastrobin per hectare. An Annex III dossier for a representative seed treatment containing fluoxastrobin was submitted and evaluated. However, owing to issues relating to the other active substances present in the formulation used for seed treatment, it was not possible to complete overall the risk assessment. Fluoxastrobin can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""HEC 5725 EC 100"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are only available to monitor the compounds given in the respective residue definitions for food, water, soil and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi -residue -method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammals, fluoxastrobin is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed and widely distributed within the body. The highest concentrations are detected in liver, kidneys and bladder as well as in the gastrointestinal tract. No accumulation in the body is observed. The major route of excretion in rats was biliary and faecal. The metabolism is extensive and 50 metabolites are identified. The acute toxicity of fluoxastrobin is low; it is not a skin or an eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. There is no evidence of genotoxicity or oncogenicity. Fluoxastrobin gave no evidence of reproductive toxicity or neurotoxicity. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.3 mg/kg bw with a 100 -fold assessment factor applied. The operator risk assessment has been conducted only on the representative use in cereals as a spray application. No risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in cereals is available in the DAR. The estimated operator exposure for HEC 5725 EC100 is below the AOEL without personal protective equipment (PPE) (34%), according to the German model. According to calculations with the UK POEM model, gloves have to be worn when handling the concentrate. The exposure for re-entry workers and bystanders is low (<10% of the AOEL). Applied to wheat plants by foliar application following a seed treatment fluoxastrobin itself and its Z isomer was the major residue found at harvest in straw and in grain accounting for about 86% and 80% of the total residue, respectively. Some metabolites found in plants were not observed in rat metabolism. However, due to their insignificant levels (<0.01 mg/kg) they were considered being of no concern in grain, whereas in straw some non-rat metabolites, e.g. 2-chlorophenol (M82(3)) and its glycoside (M84) are expected to be present at significant levels. However, M82 was also seen in livestock metabolism studies with fluoxastrobin, but others were not and their toxicity was not tested further. Depending on the soil, fluoxastrobin was shown to be highly persistent in soil and hence it was present in rotational crops at plant back intervals up to 328 days as the major residue. Decline of fluoxastrobin residues under processing conditions does not occur. Fed to ruminants and poultry, fluoxastrobin was intensively metabolised resulting in a comparable pattern to that observed in rat metabolism, with the exception of some metabolites, that were not specifically found in the rat, but not considered to be of concern due to insignificant levels (<0.01 mg/kg). In a feeding study levels of relevant compounds (fluoxastrobin, its Z-isomer and metabolite M55) in edible animal matrices were analysed, and MRLs have been proposed. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that for all consumer subgroup the intake was less then 10% of the proposed ADI. The short term exposure of all considered consumer subgroups from individual commodities, based on consumption data of UK consumers, was all below 1% of the proposed ARfD. In an assessment of possible consumer exposure and consumer risk due to intake of metabolite M48 from drinking water the margin of safety was shown to be sufficient. Under aerobic conditions fluoxastrobin yield the major metabolite M48-E and 2-chlorophenol in soil. Mineralization was generally low. Metabolite M40 was identified as a potential major anaerobic metabolite in soil. Z-isomer of fluoxastrobin was identified as the major soil photolysis metabolite. As a result of the cleavage of the molecule 2-chlorophenol will be released at an expected worst case maximum amount of 49.2 % (see EFSA addendum on fate and behaviour; 26 July, 2005). The microbiologically driven degradation of 2-chlorophenol in soil was supported with a number of studies from the open scientific literature. In field trials the Z isomer of fluoxastrobin was measured at up to 19 %- 22 %. The EPCO experts' meeting on fate and behaviour in the environment (EPCO 12) agreed that Z-isomer of fluoxastrobin should be included in the residue definition in soil and assessed for their potential ecotoxicological relevance. Persistence of fluoxastrobin in soil may be very variable. Fluoxastrobin may behave as a moderate to high persistent compound. Metabolite M48-E is moderate to medium persistent in soil. Anaerobic metabolite M40 is moderately persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. Data available from open scientific literature show that the aerobic soil metabolite 2-chlorophenol is very low to moderately persistent in soil. PEC soil were calculated from peak concentration after four subsequent seasons with a seed treatment and two foliar applications per season. Maximum PEC for M48 provided in the DAR is based on worst case field formation of 6.3 %. New PEC soil for metabolite 2-chlorophenol are provided in addendum 7 to the DAR Fluoxastrobin may be classified as low to medium mobile, M48 as medium to very high mobile and M40 high to very high mobile. The rapporteur Member State identified a Koc soil pH dependence for fluoxastrobin. No adsorption / desorption data was available for metabolite 2-chlorophenol. This has been was identified as a new data requirement by EFSA. A new study is available for 2chlorophenol that may be classified as highly mobile in soil (addendum 7, December 2007). Fluoxastrobin is stable to hydrolysis at all environmental relevant pHs. Aqueous photolysis contributes to the aqueous dissipation of fluoxastrobin. The main photolysis metabolites are: Z isomer of fluoxastrobin, M36 and M56. No studies on ready biodegradability are available and fluoxastrobin was proposed to be non ready biodegradable by the experts meeting. Only metabolite M48-E was seen above 10 % AR in the water phase of the water / sediment systems. Concomitant formation of metabolite 2-chlorophenol at levels above 10 % cannot be excluded. Degradation of fluoxastrobin was slow in both systems. Dissipation from the water phase was mainly due to partition in to the sediment. Mineralization was very low and bound residues increased during the study to a maximum of 12.7 % AR. Formation of the metabolite Z-isomer of fluoxastrobin was observed in two irradiated aerobic water sediment studies. Contribution of photodegradation to the dissipation of fluoxastrobin from the water phase in these systems is not significant, probably due to the rapid adsorption to the sediment. PECsw and PECsed were provided by the applicant for the representative use. Spray drift initial PECsw for the metabolite M48-E was calculated by the rapporteur Member State. The rapporteur Member State also provided PECsw for drainage based on their national scheme. Potential loadings to surface water through run off were not considered in the assessment presented in the DAR. Due to the fact that fluoxastrobin may be high persistent in soil, potential surface water contamination through drainage and run off may not be excluded; therefore, a comprehensive assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and effectiveness of potential mitigation measures to reduce surface water contamination is necessary to finalize the risk assessment of the EU representative uses. PECsw sED according to FOCUS SW scheme have been provided in addendum 7 (December 2006) for metabolite 2-chlorophenol up to STEP 2 based on the loadings from soil and used for the aquatic risk assessment of this metabolite. PECgw of fluoxastrobin and the metabolite M48-E were estimated using FOCUS-PELMO 1.1.1. Calculated concentrations of Fluoxastrobin at 1 m depth were negligible. However, metabolite M48-E exceeds the trigger 0.1.tg /L in eight of the nine scenarios when dependence of the adsorption Koc with the soil pH is taken into account. It is noted that for six of the scenarios the level of 0.75.tg /L is also exceeded by metabolite M48-E. Relevance assessment has been performed for this metabolite. Potential groundwater contamination by soil metabolite Z-isomer of fluoxastrobin is not addressed in the DAR, EFSA considers that the results of the exposure assessment made for fluoxastrobin may be applied to the Z-isomer. Potential groundwater contamination by soil metabolite 2-chlorophenol is not addressed in the DAR and has had not been discussed during the Peer Review. EFSA identified a new data requirement New FOCUS GW modelling provided in addendum 7 shows that levels of this metabolite are not expected to exceed 0.1 pg IL in ground water as a result of the uses proposed for fluoxastrobin. Concentration of fluoxastrobin in air is expected to be negligible due to low volatility and short half life in air for reaction with OH radicals. In the section on ecotoxicology only the risk to non-target organisms from the representative use in cereals as a spray application was assessed. No risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in cereals is available in the DAR. It should be noted that the assessment in the DAR is based on a pilot plant production. Since then the production process has been modified and optimised. Therefore, a new material accountability study and a new five batch analysis have been performed. The new resultant specification was supported by additional toxicological data, which have been peer-reviewed and accepted. An appropriate assessment with respect to ecotoxicology is still outstanding. The risk to bees, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is low with respect to fluoxastrobin and the metabolites for the representative use of fluoxastrobin as a spray application. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals can be regarded as low for the representative use of fluoxastrobin as a spray application if the risk was calculated using residue data as outlined in EPPO (1992). EFSA made a risk assessment available according to the latest guidance document on birds and mammals (SANCO/4145/2000). According to this assessment (see EFSA's addendum on ecotoxicology) the risk to mammals can be regarded as low and also the acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous and herbivorous birds as well as the acute and short term risk to granivorous birds from the representative uses evaluated can be regarded as low. But a long term risk to granivorous birds is observed (TER = 1.79 according to SANCO/4145/2000). Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to submit a refinement of the long term risk to granivorous birds for the use as a seed treatment in cereals if the risk is assessed according to the latest guidance document (SANCO/4145/2000). A high risk is identified to aquatic organisms. A bufferzone of 15 meters is needed to respect the Annex VI trigger value for the long term risk for the use of fluoxastrobin as a spray application in cereals. It was noted by the EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 13) that additional chronic invertebrate data are available. The meeting agreed that some lowering of the chronic uncertainty would be acceptable in this case and that these additional data may be used to refine the risk assessment at MS level. Furthermore the meeting decided to address a generic question on lowering the uncertainty factor by using additional chronic species sensitivity data to EFSA's Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection and their Residues (PPR). This generic question was forwarded to the PPR Panel by EFSA; the opinion of the Panel can be found on the EFSA website4. The risk of the metabolite M48 to aquatic organisms is considered to be low. The experts' meeting on ecotoxicology decided that based on biological screening data, data on Daphnia and some mammalian data that it is unlikely that the Z-isomer is of greater toxicity than the E-isomer. It is noted by EFSA that also the metabolite 2-chlorophenol is considered as a major metabolite by the section on fate and behaviour. No studies with this metabolite arc available and therefore EFSA proposes that a study or at least a solid argumentation regarding the effects of the metabolite 2 chlorophenol on aquatic organisms should be made available. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO experts meeting. A risk assessment for this metabolite was presented in addendum 7 of December 2007 and discussed in the PRAPeR expert meeting on ecotoxicology (PRAPeR 18, March 2007). The meeting concluded that the risk from the evaluated use can be considered as low. The risk to non-target arthropods was discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting. The meeting decided that based on the available data, population recovery/recolonisation in-field would be possible within one year. Therefore the meeting agreed that the risk to non-target arthropods is addressed for the representative use of fluoxastrobin as a spray application. The risk to soil micro- and macro-organisms, including earthworms is low with respect to fluoxastrobin and the metabolites M48 and M40 for the use of fluoxastrobin as a spray application in cereals. The experts' meeting decided that it is unlikely that the Z-isomer is of greater toxicity than the E-isomer (see above). It was noted by EFSA that also the metabolite 2-chlorophenol is considered as a major metabolite by the section on Fate and behaviour.No studies with this metabolite are available and therefore EFSA proposes that a study or at list a solid argumentation regarding tho effects of the metabolite 2 chlorophenol on earthworms and soil micro organisms should be made available. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO experts' meeting. A risk assessment for earthworms and soil micro-organisms was presented in addendum 7 of December 2006 and discussed by Member State experts in the PRAPeR expert meeting on ecotoxicology (PRAPeR 18 March 2007). The meeting agreed that the risk from the evaluated use can, be considered as low.",NA,,,,,
66,1772,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.46r,"Dimoxystrobin is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 the United Kingdom received an application from BASF for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2002/593/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and EFSA for EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the completeness of the dossier had been officially confirmed after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom submitted the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on dimoxystrobin, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), to the EFSA on 17 July 2003. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 14 August 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 20 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises spraying using ground base equipment to control fungal pathogens in winter wheat at application rate up to 200 g dimoxystrobin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""BAS 50700 F"", a suspension concentrate (SC), which contains as a second active substance epoxiconazole (a substance to be evaluated at stage 3, part A of the review programme under Directive 91/414/EEC). Dimoxystrobin can be used only as fungicide. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of dimoxystrobin. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. With respect to mammalian toxicology dimoxystrobin is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed. Dimoxystrobin is extensively metabolised to a large number of metabolites. The oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, it is harmful during inhalation, and the classification of Xn; R20 ""Harmful by inhalation"" is proposed. No repeated inhalation study is available. Thickening of the duodenum was the main effect observed in rats and mice. There was no evidence of genotoxicity. Dimoxystrobin was carcinogenic in mice causing an increased incidence of adenoma and adenomacarcinoma in the duodenum at the top dose. There was also focal hyperplasia in the duodenum at the top dose, interpreted as a pre-neoplastic lesion. Based on the results, the risk phrase and classification Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" is proposed. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed up to the highest dose level. There were no indications for dimoxystrobin being neurotoxic. The metabolites 505M083 and 505M094 were considered toxicologically relevant, due to the structural similarity with dimoxystrobin. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 1000) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 200). The formulation, BAS 507 OOF, contains two active ingredients dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole. The studies were not performed on the representative formulation BAS 507 OOF but on dimoxystrobin diluted in a solvent formulation with a similar composition of the non-active co-formulants in BAS 507 OOF, an ""artificial BAS 507 OOF"". The dermal absorption value was proposed to be 1% for both undiluted and diluted formulation. For epoxiconazole the rapporteur Member State proposed 10%. As the representative formulation contains two active substances the operator exposure follows a combined approach. The rapporteur Member State presented a risk assessment for each of the two active substances. For dimoxystrobin, the risk assessment is based on dimoxystrobin in the ""artificial formulation BAS 507 OOF"". The risk assessment for epoxiconazole, is based on the assumptions and proposals of the rapporteur Member State. Since epoxiconazole has not yet been evaluated, but will be in the stage 3 part A of the review programme and the studies have not been peer reviewed and none of the values has been agreed on, all values should be regarded as provisional until agreed on. The proposed risk assessment is only valid when the toxicological assessment for epoxiconazole has been agreed on later in the process and thus the risk assessment of BAS 507 OOF can not be regarded as complete, but only indicative. The risk assessment for epoxiconazole is based on the estimated exposure calculated of the formulation Opus. The estimated exposure for dimoxystrobin is below the AOEL (13%) without any PPE in the ""artificial BAS 507 OOF"". The estimated operator exposure for epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (48%) and with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (30%). If, all values are agreed on and if the actual exposure should be identified as being additive, then it might be assumed that the estimated combined exposure of dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (61%) or with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (45%) for both dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole. Applied to wheat plants by foliar application dimoxystrobin itself was the major residue found at harvest in straw and in grain accounting for about 90% and 60% of the total residue, respectively. Total levels of radioactivity in grain were too low to allow further characterization of metabolites. Dimoxystrobin turned out to be persistent in soil and hence it was present in rotational crops at plant back intervals up to 365 days. However, significant residues (>0.01 mg/kg) of dimoxystrobin or other metabolites in plant parts for human consumption are not anticipated from crop rotation. Fed to ruminants and poultry, dimoxystrobin was intensively metabolised resulting in a comparable pattern to that observed in rat metabolism, with the exception of metabolite 505M765, which was not specifically found in the rat. Despite the lipophilic character of dimoxystrobin there was no indication of accumulation in the body fat of the tested animal species. In a feeding study levels of relevant compounds (dimoxystrobin, metabolites 505M09 and 505M76) in edible animal matrices were all found to be below the respective LOQ. The assessment of chronic dietary exposure of consumers to dimoxystrobin residues based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that the most highly exposed consumer subgroup was infants at 83% of the proposed ADI. The short term exposure of all considered consumer subgroups from individual commodities, based on consumption data of UK consumers, were well within the proposed ARfD, accounting for up to 48% ARfD at a maximum from the consumption of milk by toddlers. Since there were relevant metabolites found in ground water, a consumer risk assessment was performed, considering the sum of possible intakes of dimoxystrobin and the metabolites 505M09 and 505M76 from drinking water in addition to the intake through diet. The total intakes from diet and drinking were demonstrated to be below the ADI of dimoxystrobin for the considered consumer subgroups. The degradation of dimoxystrobin in soil is initiated by the oxidation of methyl moieties of the phenyl ring. Metabolite 505M09 attained levels above 10 % AR in laboratory experiments and metabolite 505M08 was found at levels above 10 % of the applied parent in field trials. Maximum mineralization after 120 d was between negligible to 24 % AR. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 24 % after 120 d. A major photolysis metabolite 505M016 is identified in the soil photolysis study. Dimoxystrobin is medium to high persistent (DT50 = 88 401 d) in soil at 20 C. Metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 are less persistent in soil than parent compound. Dimoxystrobin is not degraded under anaerobic conditions. Degradation of dimoxystrobin is enhanced under irradiated conditions. Three field dissipation studies were performed in Germany, two in Spain and two in Sweden. Dimoxystrobin shows to be moderate to high persistent in field (DT5o (200c, pF2) = 57.6-131.6 d). Accumulation of dimoxystrobin in soil was investigated under field conditions in two trials in S.W. Germany, following repeated annual application to cereals over three years. Standard PEC soil (0 100 d) were calculated for parent and metabolite 505M01. Worst case maximum amount PEC soil for metabolite 505M01 was calculated assuming 100 % transformation from parent dimoxystrobin. The PEC soil for 505M09 values were calculated with a five compartmental model. No PEC soil was calculated for metabolite 505M08. In the RMS calculation of potential accumulation, maximum plateau concentration was reached after 5 years (PEC soil acc = 0.046 mg/kg). Residues seen in the field accumulation trials were considered to be mostly in the range of predicted concentrations. According batch equilibrium adsorption/desorption studies dimoxystrobin may be classified as low to medium mobile in soil, 505M01 as very high mobile, 505M08 as high to very high mobile and 505M09 as high to very high mobile. Dimoxystrobin is stable to hydrolysis at all environmental relevant pHs. Photolysis may moderately contribute to the degradation of dimoxystrobin in water. Degradation of dimoxystrobin in water/sediment systems was very limited. Only 10-15 % of the applied dimoxystrobin degrades after 100 d. Disappearance from the water phase is mainly attributed to partition with sediment. Additionally an outdoor water sediment study and an outdoor mesocosm study in Germany were used to investigate the aquatic dissipation of dimoxystrobin. Photolysis and partition to sediment were considered the main routes of dissipation of dimoxystrobin from the water phase in the outdoor water sediment study. In the mesocosm study dimoxystrobin was applied in early May and a dissipation DT50 = 60 69 d was calculated for the water phase. Only initial spray drift PECsw values were used in the surface water risk assessment presented by the RMS in the DAR. Other potential routes of surface water contamination such as run off and drainage are partially addressed in the DAR following published (run-off) and national RMS scheme (drainflow) but were not used further for the EU risk assessment. FOCUSsw calculations were not presented. In the opinion of EFSA's Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) related to the evaluation of dimoxystrobin7, the PPR Panel used the DT50 = 63.5 d from the outdoor pond mesocosm study, as conservative but realistic value for the exposure assessment. In this opinion it is highlighted that a single exposure event applies only to exposure via the initial spray drift. Any other exposure routes as runoff and drain flow are not covered by RMS assessment. The PPR Panel noted that FOCUSsw simulations predict higher PEC values (0.15 - 3.64 lag / L) than those calculated in the DAR (1.85 lag / L) due to the fact that drainage and runoff were the major contributors to the surface water contamination for some of the selected scenarios. A comprehensive assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and effectiveness of potential mitigation measures to reduce surface water contamination is necessary to finalize the EU risk assessment. Concentrations of dimoxystrobin and its soil metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 in groundwater predicted with FOCUSgw for the representative uses proposed were below 0.1 lag / L trigger. However, in an outdoor lysimeter study in Germany exceedance of yearly average 0.1 lag / L trigger in the leachate was observed for metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 for all three years and in all the systems studied. By comparison of modelling and lysimeter results it was concluded that high interception was needed to reduce the potential of ground water contamination and that FOCUS modelling only covers risk assessment for application to late growth stages (crop interception 90 % or greater). Potential for groundwater contamination by 505M08 and 505M09 under vulnerable conditions needs to be assessed at MS level. The concentration of the photodegradation product 505M01 are below the 0.1 [tg/L trigger when calculated form the results of the lysimeter study. Concentration of dimoxystrobin in air is expected to be negligible due to low volatility and short half life in air for reaction with OH radicals. For birds and mammals EFSA provided a risk assessment according to the latest guidance document (Sanco/4145/2000 of 25 September 2002) in an addendum which however was not yet peer reviewed. The risk assessment for dimoxystrobin (technical) resulted in TER values for the acute, short term and long term risk to insectivorous birds and mammals which met the Annex VI trigger values. However, the complete risk assessment for birds and the long term risk assessment for mammals is based on the endpoints deriving from studies with the technical active substance. Since the lead formulation contains a second active substance (epoxiconazole, listed for the 3rd stage of the peer review process) it is questionable whether it is possible to extrapolate from the toxicity of the technical active substance to the formulated product. Furthermore, the acute toxicity studies with rats showed that the formulated active substance in the lead formulation is more acutely toxic than the technical active substance. A high risk was identified for birds and mammals from the uptake of contaminated drinking water in a first tier risk assessment. EFSA is of the opinion that a high risk to birds and mammals from the application of the lead formulation cannot be excluded and additional data are required to address the risk of the lead formulation to birds and mammals. A high risk was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all tested groups of aquatic organisms. The higher tier risk assessment for fish resulted in TER values which met the revised acute TER trigger value. No agreement was reached in the EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 3) if the chronic risk assessment should be based on the endpoints deriving from the early life stage (ELS) test with rainbow trout (flow through test design) or on the ELS test with golden orfe (single application and presence of sediment). Therefore, this question was forwarded to the Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues. The PPR Panel concluded that the endpoint of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) should be used. Based on this endpoint (overall NOEC of 0.316 a.s./L) a high risk was calculated in the addendum provided by EFSA which was not peer reviewed. Therefore the high chronic risk to fish needs to be addressed with further data. A mesocosm study was conducted as a higher tier test to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae. In the EPCO experts' meeting (EPCO 3) it was agreed that a safety factor of 5 has to be applied to the TER value of 2.7 deriving from the mesocosm study. Consequently a high risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae was identified and has to be addressed with further data and risk mitigation measures are necessary. Field studies with earthworms were conducted because a high long term risk to earthworms was identified in a first tier risk assessment. The results of the field studies led to the conclusion that the long term risk to earthworms is low. The risk to bees, non target arthropods, soil macro-, soil micro-organisms, non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. The risk from the metabolites 505M01, 505M08, 505M09 to the environment is low.",NA,,,,,
67,1773,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.46r/full,"Pirimicarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pirimicarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 December 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprises broadcast spraying to control aphids in wheat at application rate up 0.21 kg pirimicarb per hectare. Pirimicarb can be used only as insecticide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Pirimor"" (""YF7904B""), a water dispersible granule (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective finalised residue definition. Only single methods for determine of residues are available since a multi-residue method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Mammalian toxicity during oral and inhalatory exposure is high and pirimicarb is a skin sensitizer, proposal for classification is T; R23/25 ""Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". Main effects observed during short term exposure were reduction in cholinesterase activity and haematological effects. Due to the consistent effects on haematological parameters at relatively low dose levels throughout the studies the proposal for classification is R48/22 ""Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged oral exposure"" There is no genotoxic potential for pirimicarb. However, in the mouse indications of a possible increase of pulmonary tumours were observed which were outside the upper historical control range. The experts' meeting could not come to an agreement whether on classification was required or not. Therefore, a question mark is added to the risk phrase and Xn; R40? is proposed ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity nor neurotoxicity was observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.035 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw, the safety factor of 100 is used. The estimated operator exposure according to the German model is below the AOEL without PPE. According to the UK-POEM gloves and respiratory personal equipment (RPE) is needed during mixing and loading and coveralls and gloves when handling contaminated surfaces. Thus, it would be appropriate to include the use of gloves and RPE due to the sensitizing properties of pirimicarb and due to the fact that it is toxic during acute oral and inhalation exposure. The metabolism of pirimicarb has been studied on wheat and supportive information was provided for 3 other crops. The residues of concern in wheat were found to be pirimicarb itself and 2 carbamate metabolites with similar or higher level of toxicity, R348363 and R348854. In other crops, another metabolite, R351405 was also present. For the use on grain, the proposed residue definition (sum of pirimicarb, R34836 and R34885 expressed as pirimicarb) for monitoring is efficient to protect adequately the safety of the consumers. No concern was identified for rotational and succeeding crops. The metabolism of pirimicarb in ruminant and poultry is extensive and the use of pirimicarb in wheat does not lead to the presence of the active substance or its carbamate metabolites in edible animal tissues. A residue definition consisting of pirimicarb only in animal tissues is proposed, although the monitoring of this compound when used under the proposed representative use does not provide value in term of consumer safety. The intake calculations for acute and long term exposures do not show any concern for the safety of the consumer. Under aerobic conditions, transformations of pirimicarb in soil yields the major metabolites R34885, R318056 and R348657. Metabolite R34836 does not reaches the 10 % AR in soil but was considered relevant because contains the intact carbamate toxophore. Mineralization of pirimicarb was low and unextractable residues accounted for a maximum of 14.9 % AR after 84 d. Under dark anaerobic conditions only metabolite R31805 was found at amounts above 10 % AR. Photolysis in soil may contribute to the environmental degradation of pirimicarb. Metabolite R34836 was the only photoproducts found at amounts above 10 % AR. Dissipation of pirimicarb under field conditions was investigated in two field studies in California (USA) and Germany (EU). In the California field study the metabolite R35140 containing the carbamate moiety was identified at average levels of 1.98 % of applied amount. Due to the fact that it contains the carbamate moiety it is considered as a relevant metabolite for soil compartment. Pirimicarb is medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 20 degrees C FMOC = 29 143 d). After the experts' meeting on fate and behaviour in the environment (EPCO 12, September 2004), RMS received an evaluation document from one MS summarizing the results of three laboratory degradation studies performed in the 1970s that was included in Addendum 4 to the DAR (December 2004). Since the original reports are still not available for evaluation these results are not considered in this conclusion and the confirmatory data requirement is maintained for these studies. It is the opinion of the RMS that, according the summary available to them, the trend for longer DT50 at lower pH is not fully consistent and that no evidence of pH effects are observed in the aqueous hydrolysis study (pirimicarb stable at pH 5-9). However, at least degradation in an additional soil would be necessary to fulfil data requirement as given in 91/414/EEC Annex II 7.1.1.2.1. since studies in only three soils are available. Experts meeting considered that field studies may qualitatively indicate a shorter persistence in field under bare soil conditions but no reliable DT50 may be obtained from them. Therefore, if the studies to be submitted with respect to the data requirement set by the evaluation meeting (see above) are finally not found acceptable to cover this data gap new data may need to be generated and provided. Metabolite R34836 is low to medium persistent (DT50 20 degrees C = 7 d - 90 d), R31805 is moderately persistent (DT50 20 inverted perpendicular degrees C = 33 d 38 d) and R34865 is moderate to medium persistent (DT5020 degrees C = 37 d 78 d). Metabolite R34885 appears to be moderately persistent in soil (DT50 20 degrees C = 14 d 31 d). Photolysis in soil may contribute to pirimicarb dissipation according laboratory soil photolysis. Initially, RMS used field half life to calculate PEC soil. The experts meetings did not accept this because field studies were performed in bare soil and representative uses imply application to fully developed crops. The contribution of photolysis may have been overestimated in the bare soil studies with respect to the lower irradiation in the cropped field. Therefore, worst case laboratory DT50 = 150 d was agreed for PEC soil calculations. New PEC soil calculations may be found in the Addendum to the DAR (December 2004). The results of batch adsorption/desorption studies indicate that pirimicarb is low to high mobile, R34836 could be classified as slightly to very high mobile, R34885 low to high mobile R31805 immobile to high mobile and R34865 immobile to medium mobile. R31805 appears to present stronger adsorption in more acidic soils. Experts meeting considered that a dependence of the Kf0, values on the soil clay content could be deduced and may need to be considered by MS in their assessments. Pyrimicarb was found to be stable to hydrolysis at environmental relevant pH 5 to 9. Photochemical degradation of pirimicarb in water under mid-European conditions is relatively rapid. Three major photochemical metabolites were identified: R34885, R31805 and R16210(8). Experts meeting considered pirimicarb to be not ready biodegradable based on water sediment study. In water sediment systems, pirimicarb partitions slowly from the water to the sediment. Degradation of pirimicarb in the sediment is very limited. Pirimicarb remained as the major component in both the water and the sediment. Mineralization was very low. Surface water risk assessment presented in the DAR is based on spray drift route of entry to surface water and considered photolysis in water (DT50 < id) as the main route of dissipation. The experts meeting agreed that whereas photolysis may play an important role to the dissipation of pirimicarb in certain environmental conditions, risk assessment based on a non-photolysis situation must be considered for EU evaluation. Therefore, PECsw were recalculated based on the longest first order dissipation half life (DT50 = 55d) for the water phase of the dark water/sediment system (Addendum 4, December 2004). Potential surface water contamination due to drainage and run off were not considered in the DAR. These routes may not be precluded and surface water risk assessment may not be considered complete without addressing them. The experts meeting identified potential for accumulation of pirimicarb into the sediment. Since no reliable half-life in the sediment may be obtained from the available water sediment study, a reasonable worst-case estimation was done by using DT50 = 335 d from the anaerobic soil degradation study. This value was used to calculate an accumulated PECsed = 29.tg / kg (Addendum 4, December 2004). However, as for the PECsw calculations this value only incorporates potential loadings through spray drift. The potential leaching of pirimicarb and its metabolites R34836, R34885, R31805, R34865 to ground water was simulated with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2 for the nine FOCUSgw scenarios. The resulting concentration for all the nine scenarios were below 0.001 ug / L. Soil metabolite R35140 identified in some field studies has not been assessed for potential ground water contamination. EFSA is of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the trigger of 0.1 ug / L would be exceeded by this metabolite. However, it needs to be properly addressed due the fact that it is more acutely toxic than the parent pirimicarb. Concentration of pirimicarb in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. If exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992), a high acute risk to birds from the use of pirimicarb was identified in the first tier risk assessment. The EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 13) decided to seek an opinion of EFSA's Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) on the principles used to refine this risk. The PPR Panel assessed the risk to birds feeding on insects in cereal fields after treatment with pirimicarb. Based on the results of this assessment, the PPR Panel is of the opinion that even at the upper limit of credible exposures, birds feeding on insects in the field are unlikely to achieve a lethal dose of pirimicarb\The short and long term risk to birds can be regarded as low if exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992). EFSA made a first tier risk assessment available according to SANCO/4145/2000 which confirms the high acute risk to birds but also indicates a long term risk to birds. Therefore, EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to submit a refinement of the long term risk to birds if the risk is assessed according to the latest guidance document (SANCO/4145/2000). For the acute risk to birds see opinion of the PPR Panel discussed above. The acute and long term risk to mammals can be regarded as low if exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992) and also if exposure is calculated according to SANCO/4145/2000. The risk to aquatic organisms can be considered as high if the risk assessment is based on the standard toxicity studies with Daphnia magna without the presence of sediment. Risk mitigation measures need to be taken into account at MS level to address this risk. The experts' meeting (EPCO 13) decided to await the outcome of the opinion of EFSA's PPR Panel on dimoxystrobinl concerning the use of a study with the presence of sediment to refine the risk. Any further refinements of the risk to aquatic organisms based on studies in the presence of sediment should be performed in accordance with the opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dimoxystrobin. The experts' meeting (EPCO 13) considered the risk to bees and non target arthropods as addressed based on the available data. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from pirimicarb and the metabolites R31805 and R34865 is considered to be low. It is noted by EFSA that no studies with the soil metabolites R35140, R34885 and R34836 are available. Therefore, EFSA proposes that a study or at least a solid argumentation regarding the effects of these metabolites on soil non-target micro-organisms should be made available. The need for these data was not discussed at an EPCO experts' meeting. The risk to earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA,,,,,
68,1774,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.44r,"Pirimiphos-methyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pirimiphosmethyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 December 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to wheat, barley and oats grains during storage and treatment for structural surfaces in empty grain stores at an application rate up to of 4 g pirimiphosmethyl per tonne and 50 g per 100 m(2), respectively. Pirimiphos-methyl can be used as insecticide and acaricide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Actellic 50EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered in several countries in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant and animal origin can be determined with a multi-method. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pirimiphos-methyl. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Pirimiphos-methyl is extensively metabolised in rats. The acute oral toxicity is moderate and it is of low inhalatory and dermal toxicity. Pirimiphos-methyl was slightly irritating to skin and eye as well as induced mild sensitization. Classification for acute toxicity is needed and the proposed risk phrase is: Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". Main effect is inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Pirimiphos-methyl was not genotoxic. No carcinogenic potential was evident in the mouse. Some rare brain and pancreatic tumours were seen in the rat study of old date and as a precautionary approach the classification and risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". No effect on reproductive performance was observed. Evidence of foetotoxicity, shifted pelvic position, was present at a high dose level. The effect is rather uncommon and the experts concluded that this finding was a variation and not a malformation and classification with R63 was not proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year studies from rat and dog with an overall safety factor of 100 (supported by human data) applied. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year dog study (time point 13 weeks) and the 13-week neurotoxicity study in the rat with the safety factor of 100 applied, supported by human data. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.15 mg/kg bw. The representative formulation Actellic 50EC is used as admixture and for structural treatment. The estimated exposure for admixture, large scale automated treatment, is below the AOEL. However, based on available data for structural treatment the estimated operator exposure is above the AOEL The decline of pirimiphos-methyl and the pattern of degradation products were similar in stored grain and after processing, even though the rate of decline strongly depended on the moisture content of the grain. Unchanged pirimiphos-methyl was the major residue found in grain and processed cereal products. Main metabolites were hydroxypyrimidine compounds, whereof 90% accounted for R046382g. The only metabolite considered to be of toxicological significance was R0363414. This metabolite was looked for in residue trials and processing studies and was shown to not form a significant part of the residue given the high levels of pirimiphos-methyl. Pirimiphos-methyl is classified as fat soluble. However, if grain treated according to the cGAP is fed to livestock animals no residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to occur in food of animal origin. Chronic consumer exposure from the use of pirimiphos-methyl as a structural treatment to empty stores is of no concern. With regard to chronic consumer exposure from the grain admixture use, the ADI is exceeded for all considered consumer subgroups. An acute dietary risk for consumers exposed to pirimiphos-methyl residues on wheat, barley and oat grain is not expected from both uses evaluated. Use of pirimiphos methyl will be restricted to indoor use for storage facilities treatment and stored cereals after harvest. Concentrations of pirimiphos-methyl in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to low volatility and short persistence in the atmosphere. Contamination of natural environments (soils and surface waters) through volatilization and deposition may be precluded. Studies to investigate the fate of pirimiphos methyl in the different environmental compartments are not required. However, aqueous hydrolysis and photolysis was investigated and results are summarized in the physical and chemical properties and fate and behaviour sections of the DAR. No readily biodegradability test is available, the substance may be considered as not readily biodegradable. Whereas, data available indicate that pirimiphos-methyl may be significantly volatilised from soil and leaf surfaces, concentrations of pirimiphos-methyl in the air compartment are expected to be negligible due to short persistence in the atmosphere. Contamination of natural environments through volatilization and deposition should be avoided with adequate measures to minimize the emissions from the storage facilities. The risk to birds, wild mammals, aquatic organisms, bees and non-target arthropods, soil micro- and micro organisms, including earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered low based on the use pattern of pirimiphos-methyl which is limited to enclosed food storage areas.",NA,,,,,
69,1775,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.102,"Rimsulfuron is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on rimsulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier DuPont de Nemours. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 12 March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to control broad-leaved and grass weeds at application rates up 20 g rimsulfuron per hectare in maize and potatoes and up to 27.5 g rimsulfuron per hectare in tomatoes. Rimsulfuron can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Rimsulfuron 25 WG"", water dispersible granules (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi -residue -method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammals, rimsulfuron has a low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. Main target organs are liver (increase of weight, minor histopathological changes) and kidney (increased weight). In dogs, testes, epidydimes and trachea are also target organs. There is no evidence of a mutagenic, genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of rimsulfuron. Rimsulfuron does not show any adverse effects on reproductive and developmental parameters. The two major metabolites IN-709413and IN -E92604 show low acute toxicity. None of them has a genotoxic potential. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.07 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 and 143 (the oral absorption was moderate), respectively. No acute reference dose (ARfD) is needed. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL without PPE, according to German model. According to calculations with UK POEM, gloves have to be used during mixing and loading (M/L) in order to be below the AOEL. The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the systemic AOEL. Rimsulfuron is rapidly metabolised in maize, potatoes and tomatoes through two degradation pathways starting with either cleavage or contraction of the sulfonylurea bridge of the molecule. Its metabolism is similar to that found in rat and none of its metabolites is of any concern. The residue definition for plant products should be rimsulfuron for monitoring and risk assessment purposes. Supervised residue trials according to the recommended use demonstrate that residues are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in maize grains and forage, potatoes as well as in tomatoes. No residue is to be expected in rotational and succeeding crops. Human and animal exposures to residues of rimsulfuron are therefore minimal, and no risk for consumers has been identified Soil degradation of rimsulfuron yields IN -70941, IN -709425 and IN -E9260 as major metabolites. Mineralization of the rings is very low but occurs, non extractable residues are relatively low (ca.21% applied radioactivity (AR) at 90 days). Rimsulfuron is of moderate persistence in soil, a major soil metabolite IN 70942 exhibits high persistence in soil, the remaining major soil metabolites are moderately to very highly persistent in soil. Under worst case conditions all these major soil metabolites have the potential to accumulate in soil when rimsulfuron is applied to the same area of land in consecutive years. The resulting accumulated plateau and maximum soil concentrations have been calculated for the intended uses notified. However the accumulated value calculated for IN 70941 may not represent the very worst case situation in colder climatic regions, so the risk to soil dwelling organisms from exposure to this metabolite should be considered further at MS level. Rimsulfuron and its major soil metabolites except IN -70942 exhibit very high to high mobility in soil. IN -70942 exhibits medium mobility. In the sediment water environment rimsulfuron degrades relatively rapidly through a combination of hydrolysis and microbial degradation to the major water metabolites IN -70941 and IN -70942. These metabolites and the additional metabolite IN-JF9996 are also major residues in sediment. In the natural sediment water system experiments the metabolite IN 70941 also degrades relatively rapidly, IN -70942 dissipates from the water phase relatively rapidly but is more persistent in sediment. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study IN -70942 degraded rapidly. Rimsulfuron is classified as not readily biodegradeable. PEC surface water and PEC sediment (initial) values (for parent and metabolites) to be used in the risk assessment for the representative uses from the spray drift route of exposure have been calculated, however the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water bodies have not been assessed. These routes of entry to surface water should be taken into account by MS when these routes of surface water exposure are relevant and the pertinent risk assessments to aquatic organisms should be completed by MS. For the notified intended uses rimsulfuron would not be expected to contaminate shallow vulnerable groundwater at annual average concentrations > 0.1[1g/1 based on the results of FOCUS groundwater modelling. The concentrations for metabolite IN -70941 are >0.75[Ig/L but <10[1g/1 (up to 0.85[1g/1) and for IN -E9260 are >0.1[Ig/L but <0.75[1g/1 (up to 0.48[1g/1). However effects assessments have confirmed that these metabolites are considered not relevant. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, non -target arthropods, soil macro organisms including earthworms and springtails and soil micro-organisms is low with respect to rimsulfuron and the metabolites IN -70941, IN -70 942, IN -E9260 and IN-JF 999 occurring in soil and surface water following application according to the proposed GAP. For the metabolite IN 70941 the calculated long-term TER value for earthworms was 4.5 and hence did not meet the Annex VI trigger of 5. No adverse effects were observed in the study and calculations were based on 10-yr accumulated PEC for soil using worst case laboratory data on formation fraction and DT50. The risk is therefore considered low. However Northern Member States may consider to conduct a risk assessment based on the longer DT50 obtained in a Danish field study. The metabolites IN -70941 and IN -E9260 have the potential to contaminate vulnerable shallow groundwater that may become surface water, at concentrations above those calculated for rimsulfuron in surface water. A risk assessment for aquatic plants should therefore be considered in MS with shallow ground water. Data from screening studies indicate however that these metabolites are not herbicidally active. A risk was identified for non -target terrestrial plants exposed to rimsulfuron via spray drift and risk mitigation measures need to be considered. A 5 m buffer zone or drift reducing measures are needed.",NA,,,,,

These pesticides were used to control West Nile virus in New York in 1999, the same year the American lobster population collapsed in western Long Island Sound (LIS). Whereas the suite of pesticides used for mosquito control changed in subsequent years, a field study was also conducted to determine pesticide concentrations in surface waters on Long Island and in LIS after operational applications. The commercial formulations used in 2002 and 2003-Scourge, Anvil and Altosid-contain the active ingredients resmethrin, sumithrin and methoprene, respectively. Concentrations of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) were also measured as a proxy for pesticide exposure. Acute mortality ill Stage I-II larval lobsters demonstrated that they are extremely sensitive to continuous resmethrin exposure. Resmethrin LC50s for larval lobsters determined under flow-through conditions varied from 0.26-0.95 mu g L-1 in 48- and 96-h experiments at 16 degrees C, respectively. Increased temperature (24 degrees C) did not significantly alter resmethrin toxicity, Malathion and methoprene were less toxic than resmethrin. The 48-h LC50 for malathion was 3.7 mu g L-1 and methoprene showed no toxicity at the highest (10 mu g L-1) concentration tested. Phenoloxidase activity was used as a measure of immune response for juvenile lobsters exposed to sublethal pesticide concentrations. In continuous exposures to sublethal doses of resmethrin (0.03 mu g L-1) or malathion (1 mu g L-1) for 7 d at 16 or 22 degrees C. temperature had a significant effect on phenoloxidase activity (P <= 0.006) whereas pesticide exposure did not (P = 0.880). The analytical methods developed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (LCTOF-MS) provided high sensitivity with mass detection limits of 0.1-0.3 ng L-1. Pesticide levels were often detected in the ng L-1 range in Long Island surface waters and western LIS (except in open waters), but rarely at concentrations found to be toxic in flow-through laboratory exposures, even immediately after spray events.",NA,,,,,

A Rodeo I R-11(R) mixture was applied directly to the surface of a pond in a manner that would produce atypically high concentrations of these compounds in water. Water samples were collected from the treated pond for chemical analyses and toxicity tests with the aquatic invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. A toxicity test with the Rodeo(R)/R-11(R) mixture was also conducted to determine the LC50 value for the larval life stage of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens. Water samples collected one hour after application contained the following mean concentrations: glyphosate, 1.83 mg/L; NPE, 1.10 mg/L; and 0.02 mg/L of the NPE breakdown product nonylphenol (NP). Concentrations of glyphosate's primary breakdown product, amino methyl phosphonic acid (AMPA),were below the laboratory detection limit of 0.020 mg/L. Water samples collected from the treated pond were not acutely lethal to Ceriodaphnia dubia. The 96-h toxicity test with the Rodeo(R)/R-11(R) mixture using Rana pipiens produced LC50 values of 6.5 mg/L for glyphosate and 1.7 mg/L for NPE, indicating that the mixture is moderately toxic to the amphibian. A comparison of toxic units for the herbicide and surfactant in the mixture indicated that the toxicity to larval frogs was likely due to R-11(R) and not Rodeo(R).",NA,,,,,
72,1778,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Trinexapac is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trinexapac in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 7 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January, February and March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator, as proposed by the applicant, which comprises foliar spraying to cereals, amenity turf and amenity grassland at application rate of 0.2 kg trinexapac-ethyl per hectare in cereals and 0.4 kg in amenity turf and grassland. Trinexapac and trinexapac-ethyl, respectively, can be used only as plant growth regulator. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Moddus 250 EC"" (""A-7725 M""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered in some EU Member States. Due to the fact that the ethyl ester, a variant of trinexapac, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant trinexapac-ethyl, unless otherwise specified. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Trinexapac-ethyl is of low acute toxicity. It is not a skin or an eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. There is no evidence of genotoxic fertility observed. The ADI is 0.32 mg/kg bw/day and the AOEL is 0.34 mg/kg bw/day with a 100-fold safety factor applied. The allocation of the ARfD was not considered necessary due to the low acute toxicity of trinexapac-ethyl. A dermal absorption of 10% was considered for both undiluted and spray preparation. The estimated operator exposure according to the German model and UK-POEM is below the AOEL with and without PPE. No data available for re-entry activities in amenity turf and amenity grassland. Following application of trinexapac-ethyl to wheat, rice and rape plants by foliar application trinexapac was the major residue found at harvest in straw and in grain or seeds, respectively, accounting for about 90% and 60% of the total residue, respectively. Other metabolites were present at very low levels. It is noted that for one non-rat metabolite CGA 351210, found in rape matrices, no toxicity assessment has been provided; however, rape is not a representative use within the evaluation process for Annex I inclusion of trinexapac. In processing procedures trinexapac-ethyl can be considered as hydrolytically stable whereas trinexapac had degraded by almost 50%. The toxicological relevance of one of the major degradation products, CGA 113745, was not further assessed, since the chronic consumer exposure to trinexapac residues from cereals is low and data on processing are not mandatory in that case. No significant residue levels are expected in rotational crops following application of trinexapac-ethyl according to Good Agricultural Practice (GAP). Fed to ruminants and poultry, trinexapac-ethyl was intensively metabolised resulting in a comparable pattern to that observed in rat metabolism, in which trinexapac is the major and only residue component of significance. In a feeding study levels of trinexapac in edible animal matrices were all found to be below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that none of the considered consumer subgroups was exposed above 1% of the proposed ADI. Due to the low acute toxicity of trinexapac-ethyl the allocation of an ARfD, and hence an acute consumer risk assessment was not considered necessary. Soil metabolism of trinexapac-ethyl yields the major metabolite trinexapac, mineralisation to CO2 is significant accounting for 49% to 58% AR depending on the part of the molecule radiolabelled. Unextracatable residues were relatively low (11-18% AR at 90 days). Trinexapac-ethyl is of very low persistence in soil, trinexapac is of low to moderate persistence. Trinexapac-ethyl and trinexapac exhibit low to high mobility in soil with adsorption decreasing (i.e. mobility increasing) as soil pH increases. In the sediment water environment trinexapac-ethyl has low persistence being converted by microbially mediated degradation to trinexapac which exhibits moderate persistence being microbially mineralised to CO2 (accounting for 59-69% of the applied ring radiolabel after 111 days). In the alkali sediment water systems tested, partitioning to sediment was limited, partitioning to sediment could be higher in natural water systems with lower pH. MS may require additional information to complete aquatic exposure and risk assessments in specific situations where surface water systems adjacent to treated areas are acidic, as sterile hydrolysis studies on trinexapac at pH 5 indicated there might be the potential for two novel breakdown products to be formed under acidic conditions. One of these breakdown products has not been identified. Trinexapac-ethyl is classified as `not readily biodegradable'. PEC surface water values to be used in the risk assessment for the representative uses from the spray drift route of exposure have been calculated, however the runoff and drainage routes of exposure to surface water bodies have not been assessed. These routes of entry to surface water should be taken into account by MS when these routes of exposure are relevant and the pertinent risk assessments to aquatic organisms should be completed by MS. For the representative uses proposed by the applicant, the potential for contamination of vulnerable groundwater by trinexapac-ethyl and its soil breakdown products above the drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L is considered minimal. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated food for the representative use in cereals is low. The first tier TER values for the long-term risk to birds and mammals are below the Annex VI trigger value indicating a high long term risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water. Further risk refinement steps are required to address the long term risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water. A high risk to insectivorous birds and mammals from the uptake of contaminated food was identified for the representative use in amenity grass/turf. The Annex VI trigger values were breached for the long term risk to birds and mammals and for the short term risk to birds from uptake of contaminated drinking water for the representative use in amenity grass/turf. Further risk refinement steps are required for the representative use in amenity grass/turf to address the long term risk to insectivorous birds and herbivorous mammals from the uptake of contaminated food and the long term risk to birds and mammals and the short term risk to birds from uptake of contaminated drinking water. Trinexapac is found in hens and mammals as a metabolite in studies with trinexapac-ethyl and therefore the toxicity of trinexapac is assumed to be covered from the studies with trinexapac-ethyl. The risk of the plant metabolites CGA 275537 and CGA 329773 to birds and mammals is considered to be low. The risk of secondary poisoning is assumed to be low because the log Pow of trinexapacethyl is < 3 and trinexapac is more polar than trinexapac-ethyl. A high risk was identified for non-target arthropods in a first tier risk assessment for the representative use in amenity grass/turf. Higher tier tests were performed showing a low risk to non target arthropods. For the higher tier risk assessment the RMS used a refined MAF value. The higher tier risk assessment was discussed at the EPCO Experts' meeting (EPCO 17) in January/February 2005. The meeting agreed to the risk assessment presented by the RMS and concluded on a low risk for non-target arthropods from the representative uses. No data were available to conclude on the risk to other soil non-target organisms. Since the standard HQ value for Typhlodromus pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi was >2 for the representative use in amenity grass/turf and a DT90 of > 100 days was observed in laboratory tests with trinexapac, a confirmatory data requirement to address the risk to other soil non-target organisms is proposed by EFSA. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO expert meeting. The risk to aquatic organisms, bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, other non-target organism and biological methods of sewage treatment from the representative uses in cereals and amenity grass/turf is considered to be low.",NA,,,,,
73,1779,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Triclopyr is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triclopyr in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying or spot treatment to control a wide spectrum of broad-leaved weeds in pasture, forestry, grassland, railways and set -a -side at application rate up 1.44 kg triclopyr per hectare. Triclopyr can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Garlon 4"" (""XRM-4714""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Due to the fact that the butoxyethyl ester (BEE, also refer to butotyl ester), a variant of triclopyr, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant triclopyr-butoxyethyl ester, unless otherwise specified. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for soil and ground water. For food of animal origin not method is available, for air a method for the determination of residues of the butoxyethyl ester is missing. Whether or not sufficient methods are available for surface water depends on the final residue definition. The methodology used is GC with MS or EC detection. A multi -residue method like the Dutch MM1 or the German S19 is not applicable to due the nature of the residues. No analytical method for the determination of triclopyr alone is available, other analytes will always be determined in parallel. Triclopyr and the ester have shown to be pharmacologically equivalent. Triclopyr is rapidly and extensively absorbed; it is mainly excreted as unchanged in urine (>80%). Only 1-2% of the administered dose is metabolised, to produce 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol in urine. Four minor metabolites were found in rats: 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of pyridinol and triclopyr conjugates. Both triclopyr and BEE are characterised by a moderate acute oral toxicity, they are not acutely toxic via dermal route, the acute inhalation toxicity of BEE is low, while data on triclopyr are not available. Both triclopyr and BEE are not skin irritant; the acid shows irritating potential to the eyes. Both of them are skin sensitiser at the modified Buehler test. Therefore, the following classification is proposed: Xn, R22 (harmful if swallowed), Xi, R36 irritating to eyes, Xi, R43 may cause skin sensitisation by skin contact. The overall relevant NOAEL from short term toxicity studies is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Neither triclopyr nor its ester have shown genotoxic potential in a battery of in vitro and in vivo test. The relevant NOAEL for long term studies is 3 mg/kg bw/day. Triclopyr did not show any carcinogenic potential. The lowest parental NOAEL was 5 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was 25 mg/kg bw/day, based on a reduction in mating indices and an increase in time to mating at 250 mg/kg bw/day in rats. The relevant developmental NOAELs were: rats: ester = 100 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL 300 mg/kg bw/day); acid = 100 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL 200 mg/kg bw/day); rabbits: NOAEL ester = 30 mg/kg bw/day (LOAEL = 100 mg/kg bw/day), developmental NOAEL acid = 75 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose tested). In the rats, retarded ossification of skull bones was observed at 200 mg/kg bw/day and an increased incidence of malformations and skeletal anomalies at 300 mg/kg bw/day. Therefore, Cat 3 R63 was agreed by the experts. The developmental toxic effects in pups in the multigeneration studies are already covered by this classification. Triclopyr did not give any indication of neurotoxic potential. TCP oral LD50 is 794 mg/kg bw in rats, 380 in mice, >1000 mg/kg bw in dogs; short term relevant NOAEL is 12 mg/kg bw/day. TCP did not show any genotoxic potential. In the rabbit the maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg bw/day and the developmental NOAEL is 25 mg/kg bw/day based on dose dependent increases in the incidence of foetal and litter CNS malformations at 100 and 250 mg/kg bw/day if compared to controls and historical control incidences. In the rat study the maternal NOAEL was 50 mg/kg bw/day, while the developmental NOAEL is 150 mg/kg bw/day representing the highest dose tested. The ADI of triclopyr is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2 -year oral study in rats with a SF 100. The AOEL is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the 13 -week oral study in rats with a SF 100 An ARfD of 0.3 mg/kg bw/day was set by the experts based on the developmental toxicity study in rabbit, with a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day and applying a SF 100. Estimated exposure is above the AOEL both with the German and UK POEM models if no PPE is worn. The AOEL is not exceeded with the German model once appropriate PPE is worn (gloves during mixing/loading, gloves, coveralls and sturdy footwear during application), either for use with boom sprayer or the knapsack application. AOEL is not exceeded both for re-entry workers (< 3.6%) and bystander (14.8%). The metabolism of triclopyr and its butoxyethyl ester in plants is adequately elucidated. Triclopyr is the major compound of the residue in vegetal tissues. This is confirmed by supervised residue trials in pasture indicating that the highest potential levels of triclopyr are in the range of 40 mg/kg, while its only identified metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, never exceeds 10 % of the triclopyr levels. Triclopyr, its conjugates and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol are considered as the only significant compounds in terms of toxicological burden present in plants that can be transferred to animals. In animal metabolism, triclopyr (major residue in milk) and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (major residue in bovine muscle, liver, fat and kidneys) were identified as compounds of toxicological relevance. 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is not specific of trichlopyr and can be produced by animal metabolism from other pesticides. This situation makes the establishment of a residue definition quite complex for enforcement reasons. 3 options for residue definition were examined during the peer review process. The first was proposed by the RMS in the DAR and consisted only in triclopyr. This option was considered by the expert meeting (EPCO 19) not protective enough of the consumer because the toxicological burden of the metabolite was not covered and a proposal consisting in the sum of triclopyr, all metabolites containing the 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol moiety and their conjugates was submitted. This option was also difficult to apply in practice due to the non specificity of the metabolite. A third proposal consisting in dissociating triclopyr on one hand and 3,5,6-trichloro-2pyridinol on the other hand in 2 separate residue definitions was proposed by EFSA, to allow regulators to consider the potential contribution of other pesticides in setting MRLs for the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. This last option required the establishment of specific toxicological end points for this metabolite and tentative ADI and ARfD have been set based on the toxicological package submitted for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. The approaches for residue definition of the expert meeting (EPCO 19) and of the EFSA were further considered for proposing MRLs and conducting the risk assessment for the consumer. These 2 approaches resulted in MRLs proposals in animal commodities which are mainly influenced by the generally higher levels of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol in these matrices. The outcome of the risk assessment was also quite similar between the 2 approaches, demonstrating the absence of risk for the consumer. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil triclopyr butoxyethyl ester has very low persistence rapidly degrading to triclopyr which exhibits moderate persistence and subsequently degrades further to the major metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol which is also moderately persistent. Mineralization of the 2,6-14C radiolabel in the ring accounted for 8-66% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in dark aerobic laboratory studies after 100 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was another significant sink (accounting for 22-46% AR at 100 days). Triclopyr butoxyethyl ester is predicted to exhibit low mobility in soil (Quantitative structure activity relationship calculations, measurement not possible due to rapid degradation). In soil triclopyr exhibits very high to high mobility and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol high mobility. In natural surface water systems (dark laboratory studies) mineralization of the 2,6-14C radiolabel in the ring was minimal (maximum 1.6% of the applied radioactivity at 100 days), unextracted residues in the sediment organic carbon were a small sink (accounting for 8-13% AR at 100 days). The major contribution to the mass balance in these studies was the formation of metabolites. Triclopyr butoxyethyl ester exhibited very low persistence degrading (primarily in the water phase) to triclopyr (max 88-95%AR in water, 14-20%AR in sediment) which further degraded with moderate persistence to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol which was also moderately persistent (max 5-19%AR in water, 14-23%AR in sediment). The major metabolites 3,6 -dichloro-2-pyridinol (max 8-38%AR in water, 15-26%AR in sediment) and 6 -chloro-2-pyridinol (max 13 %AR in water of only one of the two systems studied) were also identified. In aqueous photolysis experiments with natural water (no sediment present, with simulated summer sunlight conditions) the degradation of triclopyr and 3,6 dichloro-2-pyridinol was more rapid than in the dark experiments. In these experiments in the presence of light the only major breakdown product produced was oxamic acid (accounting for up to 16%AR). The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete appropriate EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the intended uses on Pasture and non recreational amenity grassland. Assessments are absent for the other intended uses (forestry, railways and set aside). FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates a high potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for triclopyr (with 8 out of 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios indicating annual average concentrations leaving the top lm soil layer >0.1m/1.). Modelling also indicates that the major soil metabolite 3,5,6trichloro-2-pyridinol may also contaminate groundwater but the range of vulnerable geoclimatic conditions where this might happen is less wide spread (2 out of 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios indicating annual average concentrations leaving the top lm soil layer >0.1[1g/L.). A lysimeter study indicates that when applications are made in the summer to acidic soils under vulnerable north western European conditions groundwater contamination >0.1 g/L (measure annual average leachate concentrations) for triclopyr and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is unlikely. Further data would need to be assessed on the adsorption of triclopyr over a wide soil pH range to confirm whether adsorption of triclopyr is pH dependant or not, before it was possible to confirm if the lysimeter study results could be read across to a larger range of soil pH conditions. Even then the lysimeter study covers summer application conditions only. Whilst the available data indicate the intended use on grass may be carried out without contaminating vulnerable groundwater, the data also indicate there are a wide range of conditions across Europe under which any authorised use would have to be very strictly managed to safeguard groundwater from contamination with triclopyr above the parametric legal limit (0.1[Ig/L). Only a risk assessment for the representative use in pasture is presented in the section on ecotoxicology in the DAR and the addenda. EFSA considers that this risk assessment also covers the ecotoxicological risk assessment necessary for the representative use in non -recreational amenity grassland. No risk assessment is available for the representative uses in forestry, railways and set -aside. The risk to bees, soil micro-organisms and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low. The acute risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr is considered to be low. Also the acute risk to herbivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr BEE is low. A high acute risk to insectivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr BEE was identified in the first tier risk assessment and the EPCO experts' meeting did not agree with the presented refined acute risk assessment. Therefore a data requirement was set for the notifier to submit a refined acute risk assessment for insectivorous birds. The short term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds from exposure to triclopyr and triclopyr BEE can be considered as low. The long term risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds is high. Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address this risk. The long term risk to birds was only identified by the RMS after revision of the risk assessment as requested by the EPCO experts' meeting and therefore this data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO Expert meeting. A low acute and short term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and a low acute risk to herbivorous mammals from exposure to the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol was identified. A high acute risk to mammals from exposure to triclopyr BEE and triclopyr was identified. The EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit data to support the assumptions, besides the residue data, used in the presented refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. It is noted by the EFSA that a second oral acute toxicity study with rats and the formulation Garlon 4 is available which leads to a lower endpoint than the endpoint which was taken into account in the DAR. If the endpoint of this study with the formulation Garlon 4 is expressed in triclopyr BEE equivalents the toxicity is higher than the toxicity from triclopyr BEE alone. Therefore EFSA proposes to take the LD50 of 900 mg Garlon 4/kg bw into account when refining the acute risk to herbivorous mammals (see data requirement above). Also a high long term risk to herbivorous mammals is identified. The RMS did not present a refined risk assessment in the addendum of June 2005 as requested by the EPCO experts' meeting but proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address this long term risk to mammals. A high risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water was observed in the first tier risk assessment by EFSA (see addendum). Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to refine the risk to birds and mammals from exposure to contaminated drinking water. This assessment was neither discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting nor peer reviewed. A high acute risk to aquatic invertebrates was identified as the TER values (15-434) are below the Annex VI trigger value of 100 for 9 out of 11 FOCUS Step 3 scenario's. EFSA does not find it appropriate to refine a risk, which is based on a flow -through study with C. virginica, with a static study which was performed with D. magna. Therefore EFSA proposes that risk mitigation measures are taken into account at MS level to address the acute risk to aquatic invertebrates or a static study with C. virginica should be requested at MS -level. A low long term risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to triclopyr but a high long term risk to fish from exposure to triclopyr BEE was observed. The EPCO experts' meeting considered a long term risk assessment for triclopyr BEE necessary because of contamination of surface water by drainage. This was discussed internally in EFSA after the EPCO Expert meeting. EFSA considers that with the intended use of only 2 applications a year with a minimum 6 month interval and the fact that soil and water half lives of the ester are < 1 day, long term exposure to aquatic organisms from drainage to the ester will not occur at least for the notified representative uses. Therefore EFSA proposes that risk mitigation measures should be envisaged at MS level to address the long term risk to fish from exposure to triclopyr BEE if the local conditions are very sensitive to drainage or if local uses have shorter intervals than assessed in the DAR. Furthermore EFSA proposes that also risk mitigation measures are taken into account at MS level to address the long term risk to D. magna from exposure to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol for the D2 ditch scenario. The acute risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol can be regarded as low. The EPCO experts' meeting set a further data requirement for the notifier to submit at least an algae study with this metabolite 3,6- dichloro-2-pyridinol or to submit the validation of the ECCOSAR model (used by the notifier to address the risk from this metabolite) or another suitable model for this substance class. Furthermore the metabolite 6-chloro-2-pyridinol was identified as a major metabolite by the section on Fate and behaviour. No studies with this metabolite are available. Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to address the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to the metabolite 6-chloro-2-pyridinol. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO Expert meeting. The metabolite oxamic acid is considered to be not ecotoxicologically relevant by EFSA. The risk to Lemna gibba can be considered as low but the EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit the full study reports of all studies referred to in the DAR regarding dicotyledonous higher aquatic plants as it was questioned that Lemna gibba is an appropriate indicator plant. The risk to aquatic higher plants can only be concluded when this data becomes available. Based on the available studies the risk to non target arthropods is considered to be addressed. The risk to non -target plants can be considered as low if risk mitigation measures such as a bufferzone of 5 metres are taken into account. The acute risk to earthworms is considered to be low. The long term risk to earthworms from exposure to the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol is also regarded to be low. The EPCO experts' meeting decided to set a data requirement for the notifier to submit an argumentation if the concentration of 9.6 acid equivalent per kg dry soil, at which the NOEC for earthworms was set, was reached during the study. The long term risk to earthworms can only be concluded once this argumentation becomes available. At the moment no final conclusion can be drawn regarding the need for a litter bag study with triclopyr due to the outstanding data requirement regarding the long term risk to earthworms. EFSA considers a collembolan reproduction study or a study on gamasid mites with triclopyr necessary given the effects seen on Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri in the standard laboratory toxicity studies. The need for this data was not discussed at an EPCO Expert meeting. As 3,5,6- trichloro-2-pyridinol is a major ground water metabolite, a study on the herbicidal activity of this metabolite is considered necessary by EFSA. The need for such a study was not discussed in an EPCO Expert meeting.",NA,,,,,
74,1780,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Dimethenamid is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dimethenamid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 October 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 31 October 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast as pre or post emergent herbicide comprise broadcast spraying to control weeds in maize (pre or post) and sugarbeet (post) at an application rate of 1.44 kg dimethenamid per hectare (maize) and up to 1.08 kg per hectare (sugarbeet), respectively. Dimethenamid can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Frontier"" (""BAS 656 02 H""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food, surface water and air. For the other matrices (soil and ground/drinking water) the residue definitions are not finalised. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The applicability of the German S19 method has been demonstrated, but not down to the LOQ of concern). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of dimethenamid. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Dimethenamid was well absorbed and extensively metabolised by rats. Excretion was rapid primarily via bile, over 40 metabolites were detected in excreta. The compound has a moderate acute toxicity orally and low acute toxicity dermally or by inhalation, and produces only mild reversible skin and eye irritation. It is a skin sensitizer in the Maximisation Test. Therefore, the proposed classification is Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed""; Xi, R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The short term as well as the long term toxicity indicates the liver as the target organ. The available data do not support evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic properties, and dimethenamid is not harmful to fertility or development. The reference values are 0.02 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL), and 0.25 mg/kg bw/day for the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The estimated operator exposure is above the AOEL for UK-POEM model even with protective equipment but below the AOEL according to the German model with protective equipment. Worker exposure is low even without protection. Bystander exposure is negligible (below 1% of the AOEL). Dimethenamid is metabolised in maize and sugar beets through conjugation processes and further chemical reactions leading to polar metabolites. Due to their overall low level and in the absence of any tendency to accumulation, no metabolite is considered of toxicological concern. The residue definition for plant products should be for monitoring and risk assessment purposes dimethenamid, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers) expressed as dimethenamid. Supervised residue trials according to the recommended uses demonstrate that residues are below the LOQ in maize grains and forage, as well as in sugar beet roots and tops. No residue is to be expected in rotational and succeeding crops. Human and animal exposures to residues of dimethenamid are therefore minimal, and a risk for consumers is not expected resulting from the consumption of plant commodities derived from maize and sugar beets. Similarly, a risk for the consumer resulting from the consumption of drinking water contaminated by metabolites M23 and M27 is not expected. The contribution to the global toxicological burden of 16 other metabolites potentially present in drinking water at levels above 0.1 mil and their potential effects on the health of the consumer could not be assessed as their structures were not identified. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate dimethenamid is moderately persistent in soil degrading via glutathione and or cysteine conjugation and subsequent oxidation forming the major metabolites M233 and M274. These metabolites were moderately to highly persistent but were degraded further. Mineralization of the 3-14C-thienyl label accounted for 8-36% of the applied radioactivity in dark aerobic laboratory studies after 120 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was another significant sink (accounting for 40-45% of the applied radioactivity at 120 days). Dimethenamid exhibits medium mobility in soil, M23 and M27 have very high mobility. Modelling and a lysimeter study for the representative uses evaluated, indicated dimethenamid is unlikely to contaminate groundwater when used as recommended, but that the metabolites M23, M27 and 16 separate resolved but unidentified fractions could be present in shallow vulnerable groundwater at greater than 0.1 g/L. 12 of the unidentified components and M23 and M27 could be expected to be present in shallow vulnerable groundwater at concentrations greater than 0.75[Ig/L. Data to address the aquatic risk and pesticidal activity of all these components are available (though some of this data still requires independent evaluation). A risk to consumers is not expected from the consumption of M23 and M27 in drinking water. However mammalian non relevance assessments for the 16 as yet unidentified fractions are not available and cannot be provided until the identity of these fractions is known. It is therefore necessary to identify the nature of these fractions. Under very extreme worst case leaching conditions, Member State experts considered it could not be excluded that M27 could be present in shallow vulnerable groundwater at > 10 g/L. In natural surface water systems dimethenamid exhibits moderate persistence and in line the Kfoc there was some partitioning to sediment, however degradation rate in the whole systems and in the water phase were similar. There were no major metabolites in water or sediment. Mineralization of the 3-14C-thienyl label was low accounting for only 2-3% after 105 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the sediment organic carbon was the major sink (accounting for 49-53% of the applied radioactivity at 105 days). The risk to birds and mammals was considered low in the initial assessment. However, a high first tier risks to insectivorous birds for both representative uses and to medium herbivorous mammals in maize was identified in the assessment according to the current guidance (SANCO/4145/2000). Further data is thus needed to refine the risk assessment for birds and mammals. A high risk was also identified for algae and aquatic macrophytes. Buffer zones of 20 m are required for the proposed application rate in maize. For bees and other non-target arthropods the risk is considered low. Effects were observed in laboratory studies with A.rhopalosiphi, however recolonisation is considered to be possible within a reasonable time frame. The acute risk to earthworms from dimethenamid and the soil metabolites M23 and M27 is low. No chronic studies are available for the metabolites that have DT90 values longer than 1 year in studies from southern Europe. Although the acute toxicity is low a long-term risk to earthworms cannot be excluded without further testing. Whether studies on other soil macro-organisms are needed can only be concluded after the long-term risk assessment for earthworms has been finalised. The risk to soil micro-organisms is considered low. Risk mitigation measures are necessary to protect non-target plants for the use in maize.",NA,,,,,
75,1781,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Thiodicarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on thiodicarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 19 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 13 February 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience S.A. (notification and submission made by Aventis CropScience prior to merger to form Bayer CropScience). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and molluscicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control chewing and sucking insects in table and wine grapes and spreading baits to control slugs and snails in cereals. The application rates are 0.375 kg and 0.2 kg thiodicarb per hectare, respectively. Thiodicarb can be used only as insecticide and molluscicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Larvin"" and ""Skipper"", a suspension concentrate (SC) and a granular bait (GB), respectively. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Thiodicarb is rapidly and extensively absorbed, via gastrointestinal tract in rats (>70%, based on excretion data) and distributed. Excretion occurs primarily as volatile components (acetonitrile, CO2) in expired air (about 40%) and in urine (about 30%). Less than 10% is excreted in faeces. The acute toxicity is high, (oral LD50 59 mg/kg bw) as well as during inhalatory exposure (LC50 0.81 mg/L air). Acute dermal LD50 is greater than 2000 mg/kg bw. It is not a skin or an eye irritant but is a skin sensitizer (Magnusson and Kligman test). Classification for acute toxicity is needed and the proposed risk phrases are: T; R23/R25 (Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed)"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". Repeated exposures resulted in decreased body weight and food consumption, alterations in haematological parameters, haemolytic anemia, haemosiderosis and extramedullary haematopoiesis, as well as signs of cholinergic effects. The relevant oral NOAEL for short term exposures is 5 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAELs for chronic toxicity in rats is 3 mg/kg bw/day. Overall, thiodicarb does not show genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The parental and reproductive NOAELs for thiodicarb are 7 mg/kg bw/day based on significantly reduced body weights in adults and pups and reduced pup viability at 15 mg/kg bw/day. Due to the increased mortality of pups at dose levels which is not associated with marked maternal toxicity, classification as Cat. 2 and R61 was proposed. A statement was forwarded to ECB (European Chemical Bureau, Ispra). In teratogenicity studies, the NOAEL for maternal effects in the rat is 1 mg/kg bw/day, based on reduced body weight and clinical signs. The relevant developmental NOAEL is 30 mg/kg bw/day (highest tested dose). In a 90-day study in rats, the NOAEL for neurotoxic effects is 6 mg/kg bw/day, based on the inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase at 23 mg/kg bw/day and above. The ADI is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, from the teratogenicity study in rats with a safety factor of 100. The AOEL is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, from the two generation study in rats (7 mg/kg bw/day) using a safety factor of 500, due to the severity of reproductive effects. The ARfD is 0.01 mg/kg bw, based on the lowest observed NOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day from the teratogenicity study in rats, supported by the LOAEL of 5 mg/kw from the acute neurotoxicity study, with a safety factor of 100. The RMS has provided a risk assessment only for operators exposed to thiodicarb during application of Larvin on grapevines. The exposure estimates is below the AOEL of 0.014 mg/kg bw/day for orchard sprayer activity only when PPE is used (German model); for hand held activities, exposure does not exceed the AOEL even without PPE (German model) or with PPE (UK POEM). For workers and bystanders the estimated exposure is below the AOEL. The metabolism of thiodicarb in fruits after foliar application is clearly understood and its main degradation product of toxicological relevance is methomyl. The residue definition proposed for both monitoring and risk assessment is the sum of thiodicarb and methomyl expressed as methomyl. No other metabolite needs to be considered in the residue definition due to its potential contribution to the toxicological burden. Ultimate degradation products of thiodicarb are acetonitrile and carbon dioxide, the last being reincorporated in endogenous plant materials. No residues are expected to be present in following crops. In animal the metabolism of thiodicarb is extensive and no carbamate related compound is present in edible animal commodities. There is no need for defining a residue definition for animal products or to monitor residues resulting from the representative uses of thiodicarb in these products. In grapes and cereals, supervised residue trials support the establishment of MRLs at 1 and 0.05* mg/kg respectively. In wine the residue transfer is limited and the residue level in wine is not expected to be higher than 50 % of the residue level in raw grapes. The risk assessment carried out for the representative uses supported by the applicant indicated an acute risk resulting from the consumption of wine and table grapes. Under dark aerobic conditions in soil methomyl was the only major metabolite of thiodicarb. Two major metabolites were identified under dark anaerobic conditions S-methyl-N-[V-methyl-N(methylaminothio) carbamoyloxy] thioacetamidate and acetonitrile. Photolysis may contribute slightly to the environmental degradation of thiodicarb being acetonitrile the only major soil photolysis metabolite. Thiodicarb is very low to low persistent in soil under aerobic laboratory conditions. Under the same conditions methomyl is low persistent in soils. Whereas not triggered by the directive, field dissipation studies are available for thiodicarb formulated either as water flowable or slow release pellets. Thiodicarb is low to high mobile and methomyl is very high mobile in soil. In sterile buffer solutions at 25 C thiodicarb and methomyl degradation are pH dependent. The main product of thiodicarb hydrolysis is methomyl. Contribution of aqueous photolysis to the environmental degradation of thiodicarb and methomyl is deemed negligible. Thiodicarb is not ready biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, thiodicarb degrades very fast to methomyl in the water phase (DT50 < 1 d). Degradation of methomyl was also fast with half lives between 3.5 to 5 days in the total systems. PEC sw of the insecticide application is calculated based on spray drift loadings and were found acceptable. A comprehensive surface water risk assessment, including drainage and runoff routes of entry in surface water, will be necessary to complete the risk assessment of the pellets formulation and the molluscicidal use. RMS decided not to further assess the molluscicide use and the pellet formulation due to the number of data gaps identified at the initial assessment. The potential leaching of thiodicarb and its metabolite methomyl for the insecticidal use in vines and the molluscicidal use in winter cereals was simulated for the relevant FOCUS gw scenarios. The trigger of 0.1 lag / L was not exceeded for any of the seven scenarios simulated for the insecticidal use (LARVIN) and was exceeded by two of the nine scenarios simulated for the molluscicidal use (SKIPPER). The assessment of the EU representative molluscicidal use may not be considered finalised with respect to the potential for ground water contamination. For the insecticidal use on vines a new simulation was presented the Addendum 1. This new modelling confirms the results found previously. Monitoring data on cereal cropping areas of UK show occasional breaking of the 0.1.tg / L trigger by methomyl it is not possible to know if the origin of this methomyl is from thiodicarb use or due to the application of products containing methomyl as active substance. Concentration of thiodicarb in the air compartment and transport through it, is not expected to be significant. The risk assessment for terrestrial vertebrates was performed in line with the EPPO (1992) risk assessment scheme. The risk to insectivorous birds from the use of larvin' as a foliar spray is considered to be low in terms of acute, short-term and long-term toxicity from the active substance, thiodicarb. With regards to the metabolite, methomyl, the first tier acute toxicity TER highlighted that there was a high risk, which was not seen in either the short-term or long-term assessments. The assessment was refined by using the end point from the short-term dietary study converted to a daily dose instead, as it was proposed to be more appropriate for this scenario. As a result, the TER value was above the Annex VI trigger and acute risk to birds from methomyl was considered to be low. The approach was discussed at the experts' meeting for ecotoxicology (EPCO 17) and it was agreed to await the opinion of the PPR panel for pirimicarb where a similar approach was used. The opinion for pirimicarb was adopted in July 2005' and it is proposed by the EFSA that a risk assessment is performed in accordance with the recommendations provided in this opinion. The acute risk to mammals was considered low based on a 1-day dietary study on mice from which the NOEL for mortality was used with a safety factor of 10. The long-term risk to mammals is on the borderline of the Annex VI trigger following refinement based on residue decline in grass. For the use of the pellet formulation (Skipper') high acute and long-term risks were identified for birds and mammals. Additionally an acute risk from consumption of methomyl contaminated earthworms was identified. The argumentation and proposals initially presented by the applicant to refine the risk was not considered robust enough by the rapporteur Member State. New data to refine the identified acute and long-term risks to birds and mammals has been provided by the applicant. These data have not been evaluated by the rapporteur Member State and it is therefore at this stage not possible to conclude on the risk from the 'Skipper' formulation. With regard to the use of larvin' risk mitigation comparable to 40 m buffer zones is required to protect aquatic organisms. With regards to 'Skipper' low risk to aquatic organisms is considered if the product is applied to undrained or peaty soils or to soils represented by Quorndon soils. If 'Skipper' is used on soils more vulnerable to drainage, there is a high potential risk for exposure of surface water via drainage and risk mitigation measures must be considered at Member state level. Additionally contamination of surface water from run-off should be considered. Before the risk assessment for the aquatic environment can be finalised a study on acute toxicity to aquatic gastropods should be conducted and evaluated. Thiodicarb is toxic to honeybees. However, field data are available showing that after 12 hours residues were non-toxic. For larvin' risk mitigation measures, e.g. applications outside flowering or in the evening are proposed to be considered at Member State level. Due to the timing of the applications for 'Skipper' (autumnal use and applied directly to the ground), the risk to bees from its use is considered low. For non-target arthropods there is a potential for recolonization since residue decline is relatively rapid, effects on mortality and reproduction are below 50% in 5-7 days aged residue studies, and in the case of larvin' less than 50% mortality is expected for the most sensitive species tested at 3 m distance from the treated field. However, the EPCO experts' meeting for ecotoxicology was of the opinion that oral route of exposure had not been sufficiently addressed in the studies and risk mitigation measures for the use of larvin' should therefore be considered at Member State level. For the use of 'Skipper' the acute risk to earthworms from pellets on the soil surface needs to be addressed. Additionally, a long-term risk to earthworms from the exposure to methomyl was identified. A field study to address the risk is ongoing. Pending the evaluation of new data, the risk assessment for earthworms for the use of 'Skipper' cannot be finalised. The risk to soil microbial processes and to non-target flora is low.",NA,,,,,
76,1782,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.57r,"Cyprodinil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cyprodinil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control fungi from the classes Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes in winter wheat and apple at application rates of 750 g (wheat) and 225 g (apple) cyprodinil per hectare. Cyprodinil can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""UNIX 75 WG"" and "" CHORUS 50 WG"", both water dispersible granules (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for food of animal origin. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multimethod (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of cyprodinil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Cyprodinil is absorbed to a high degree (> 80%) within 48 hours, based on rat excretion data. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is low as well as during inhalatory exposure. It is not a skin or an eye irritant but is a skin sensitizer (Magnusson and Kligman test). Classification for sensitization properties is needed and the proposed risk phrase is Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". Reduced body weight some minor changes in haematological and blood parameters were observed at the top dose during repeated exposure. There is no genotoxic, carcinogenic or neurotoxic potential for cyprodinil and no adverse effects were seen on reproduction parameters. None of the metabolites (3CGA 249287, 4CGA 275535, 5NOA 422054, 6CGA 321915, and 7CGA 232449) were of toxicological concern. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day with a safety factor of 100 used and no acute reference dos (ARfD) was allocated due to the low acute toxicity of cyprodinil. The dermal absorption values are 0.5% for the concentrate and 6% for the dilution and the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL for both UNIX and CHORUS without PPE according to the German model. The metabolic fate of cyprodinil in plants has been fully elucidated for the representative uses supported by the applicant. Based on the persistence of the product and the absence of metabolite of concern, the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is limited to cyprodinil. Residue studies were conducted in apples and wheat, supporting the setting of MRLs at 0.05 and 0.02* mg/kg respectively (*indicates that the LMR is set at the limit of quantification of the method of analysis.). In succeeding crops, no residues are expected at measurable level under normal conditions of use of the product and normal cropping practices. In animals a major metabolite of cyprodinil (CGA 304075) was identified and should be included in the residue definition. Feeding studies were carried out without analysis of this metabolite, and it is therefore not possible to propose MRLs for animal commodities. However, despite this lacking information, a consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account the residues in plant commodities only, indicating that the exposure of the consumer is far below the ADI of cyprodinil. Based on the metabolism data, the expected residue levels in animal commodities are expected to be very low and not of a nature to significantly influence the outcome of the intake calculations based on plant commodities only. The available data demonstrate that in soil cyprodinil degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287. The minor breakdown products 8CGA 304075, 9CGA 304076 and CGA 321915 were also identified. Mineralization of the phenyl and pyrimidyl rings accounted for only 6-14% AR and 0.3-11% AR respectively after 90-112 days incubation at 20-25 degrees C. The corresponding values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile including Soxhlet extraction were 36.8 -61.2 % AR and 10.6 -68.3 % AR. In most studies Cyprodinil exhibited moderate persistence in soil with the major metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287 exhibiting very low persistence and moderate to high persistence respectively. In field studies this pattern of soil persistence was confirmed with there being evidence that the analysed extractable breakdown products (CGA 275535, CGA 249287 and CGA 321915) declined in concentration after their maximum measured concentrations. However it was observed in the 1 laboratory experiment with a more acidic soil (pH 5.2) and in a very acidic (pH 4.9) soil in 1 German field experiment, that cyprodinil exhibited very high persistence. Cyprodinil could therefore be more persistent in very acid soils (around pH 5 and below), though the available database (2 acidic soil experiments) is too small to confirm this hypothesis. Member States which have significant areas of acidic soils in arable or horticultural production should request additional information to confirm if this is a real correlation and if it is confirmed, further information to address the consequences of higher persistence in acidic soils. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cyprodinil and CGA 275535 exhibited low mobility. CGA 249287 exhibited medium to low mobility in soil, with adsorption of CGA 249287 appearing to be pH dependent (lowest adsorption at highest soil pH). In sediment water systems cyprodinil dissipated from water relatively rapidly, partitioning to sediment where it exhibited high persistence. It did degrade to the metabolite CGA 249287 which was a major sediment but minor water metabolite. This metabolite exhibited moderate persistence. The major sink in the mass balance was the formation of residues not extracted by acetonitrile: water Soxhlet extraction. Mineralization of the pyrimidyl ring to CO2 was low < 5% AR after 260 days. This value for the phenyl ring was slightly higher at up to 11% AR. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for assessing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. The drainage and runoff routes of entry have not been assessed. These routes of entry should be taken into account by MS when these routes of entry to surface water are relevant and the pertinent risk assessment to aquatic organisms should be completed. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing for cyprodinil and its major soil metabolites CGA 249287 and CGA 275535 is minimal when soil pH is above 5. This assessment appropriately covered the observed lower soil adsorption of CGA 249287 at higher soil pH. As there is evidence cyprodinil might be more persistent in very acidic soils, MS that have significant areas of such soils associated with pertinent plant production and vulnerable groundwater leaching situations should require applicants to provide groundwater exposure assessments to cover this situation. A high long term risk was identified for insectivorous birds for the representative use in cereals (application to late growth stages). The EPCO experts' meeting agreed that a risk assessment for early growth stages in cereals should be conducted since it is not fully justified that growth stage BBCH 32 of wheat can be regarded as a late growth stage. The RMS presented a risk assessment for early growth stages in addendum 2. The TER values for the long term risk to insectivorous birds, herbivorous birds and herbivorous mammals were 2.8, 4.8 and 1.7, respectively, indicating a high risk to birds and mammals from the intended use in wheat if the product is applied to early growth stages. A refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds and a refined long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was provided by the notifier and summarized in addendum 3. Addendum 2 and addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. The RMS considers the risk to herbivorous birds as low since the first tier TER value of 4.8 is close to the trigger of 5 and based on the NOEC from the highest tested dose in a reproduction study. However, it should be taken into account that the argumentation provided in addendum 2 is not peer reviewed. A high risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was shown in a first tier risk assessment for the representative use in cereals and a high long term risk to birds for the representative use in orchards. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low. The risk to birds and mammal of secondary poisoning and the risk from uptake of plant metabolites is considered to be low. Crustaceans (Cladocera) were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for the representative use in apples indicated a high acute and chronic risk to fish and daphnids. For the representative use in cereals a high acute and chronic risk was identified only for daphnia. Additional single species tests were used to reduce the acute TER trigger value from 100 to 10 in the higher tier risk assessment. The risk assessment based on the endpoints from single species tests resulted in TER values which meet the relevant acute and chronic Annex VI trigger values taking into account buffer zones of 40 m (orchards) and 10 m (cereals). Depending on the outcome of the PPR opinion on the use of the microcosm study, the results of the microcosm study could be taken into account at MS level for further risk refinement. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil nontarget micro-organisms, other non-target-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA,,,,,
77,1783,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.55r,"Clopyralid is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clopyralid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 December 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Two other companies (Barclay Chemicals and United Phophorus Ltd.) also notified but it was not possible to reach an agreement. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January - March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control a narrow spectrum of broadleaved weeds in cereals, oilseed rape, sugar beet and pasture at application rate up 127 g clopyralid per hectare for cereals, up to 300 g for oilseed rape and sugar beet, and up to240 g for pasture. Clopyralid can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Lontrel 100"", an emulsifiable concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for food of animal origin. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Clopyralid is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed in the rat. It is widely distributed and the highest concentration was found in the liver. There was no evidence of accumulation. Clopyralid is not metabolised. The acute toxicity is low i.e. oral LD50 > 5000 mg/kg bw, dermal LD50 > 2000 mg/kg bw and inhalatory exposure LC50 > 1 mg/L air. It does not induce skin irritancy or sensitization. However, clopyralid induced a marked irritation in the eyes of the rabbit and the symptoms persisted after 21 days. Thus, the proposal for classification for acute toxicity is Xi; R41"" Risk of serious damage to eyes"". It is not genotoxic, carcinogenic or toxic towards reproduction. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.15 and 1 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 applied. No ARfD is set. A default of 10% for dermal absorption is set for Lontrel 100. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL even without PPE (34%), according to the UK POEM model. No extensive metabolism occurred in the crops studied and hence clopyralid was found to be the major component of the residue in plants. The metabolism of clopyralid was similar in all studied crop groups and an adequate number of residue trials on the representative crops cereals, sugar beet, rape seed and pasture is available. For the use on cereals the experts' meeting for residues concluded that processing studies need to be submitted. Significant amounts of clopyralid residues were found in potential feeding stuff. Therefore animal metabolism was investigated in ruminants and in poultry, indicating the majority of the residue found in animal matrices being clopyralid in free and conjugated form (the latter mainly in milk). From the study it was concluded that, apart from conjugation with glycin, clopyralid was not metabolised in livestock and that the occurrence of significant residues (> 0.01 mg/kg) in edible animal tissues may be expected. Thus, feeding studies with clopyralid in ruminants, hens and pigs have been evaluated. It is noted that further data need to be submitted to assess the validity of some of the metabolism and feeding studies and to confirm the proposed MRLs for food of animal origin. Data to support the assumption that no significant residues will occur in rotational crops have not been submitted, but may be required since there are indications that clopyralid residues in soil may be taken up and accumulated in rotational crops. In a consumer risk assessment it was demonstrated that exposure to residues resulting from the representative uses of clopyralid is well below the ADI for the considered consumer groups. Even though intake of clopyralid residues is not likely to pose a high risk to consumers the current assessment needs to be confirmed by the data still to be submitted. An acute risk for consumers through clopyralid residues on food is not anticipated, as no ARfD has been proposed. No degradation products of clopyralid that accounted for more than 10 % AR were identified in soil under aerobic conditions. Volatiles collected in a trap with alkaline solution (attributed to CO2) amounted up to a maximum of 83.3 % AR. Minimal degradation occurred under anaerobic conditions. Photolysis will not contribute to the dissipation of clopyralid in soil. Clopyralid is moderate to medium persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at application rates in the range of the ones proposed for the representative uses but degradation seems to be slower when higher application rates are used. In the field studies clopyralid dissipated slightly faster being low to moderate persistent. Only initial PEC soil are used in the ecotoxicological risk assessment. The batch soil adsorption/desorption studies indicate that clopyralid is very high mobile in soil. Lysimeter studies show exceedance of 0.1 mu g /L at individual data points but not as annual average. However, none of the lysimeter studies represent the worst case GAP. Notifier has indicated to the RMS their wish not to support anymore autumn uses. Therefore, neither interim nor final reports of the lysimeter study after the autumn application (Study K84) have been submitted. MS may need to require it for their assessment. Clopyralid is expected to be stable to hydrolysis at environmental relevant pHs. Photodegradation will not be an environmental significant degradation pathway in water. Clopyralid should be classified as a non ready biodegradable. Clopyralid partitions slowly from the water to the sediment and reaches a maximum of 30.6 % AR after 100 d into the sediment. There is practically no degradation of clopyralid in the water /sediment system and up to 91 % AR remains as clopyralid at the end of the experiment (100 d). Non extractable radioactivity in the sediment amounted up to 5.85 % AR at the end of the study. The amount of CO2 formed slowly increased to between 2.3 % and 5.3 % AR after 100 d. PEC sw were calculated based on the critical GAP from the table of representative uses and spray drift loadings. FOCUS sw was not used but run off and drainage were considered in the DAR. For run off PEC sw were calculated based on a 0.5 % run off from a 1 ha field to a 0.2 ha surface and 1m depth pond. For contamination through drain flow UK scheme was followed, giving rise to higher concentrations than those obtained by spray drift. This value was used for the risk assessment presented in the DAR. As for PEC sw, also drain flow PEC sed was the higher one. Therefore, EFSA proposes that a comprehensive aquatic risk assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and the effectiveness of potential risk mitigation measures should be conducted following the FOCUS sw scheme to confirm the results of this assessment. PEC gw of clopyralid were estimated using FOCUS-PELMO 2.2.2. and the mean normalized laboratory half life (DT50 = 38 d) corrected for the moisture content (36 d). Calculation of the 80th percentile of annual average concentrations of clopyralid at 1 m depth show that the 0.1 mu g /L is exceeded for all the relevant scenarios corresponding to some of the proposed uses and for a number of scenarios of the rest of them. An assessment based on field half lives has been presented to the RMS and summarized in addendum 2 (August 2005) but has not been peer reviewed. A complete report on this new modelling is required. Based on the peer reviewed data, MS may need to consider risk for potential ground water contamination under vulnerable situations. Autumn uses are not longer supported by the notifier and are not covered by this assessment. Concentration of clopyralid in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and soil macro-and microorganisms from clopyralid used according to the proposed GAP is considered low based on available studies and information. For the maximum application rate proposed in a single application, 240 g a. s./ha for pasture, a 5 m buffer zone or drift reducing measures are necessary to protect non-target plants outside the field. Calculated TER values are 3.8 and 18.5 at 1 and 5 m distance respectively based on a spray drift of 2.77 %. No major soil or water/sediment metabolites were detected in the soil degradation studies or in the water/sediment studies. Therefore the risk assessment for the environment is based solely on clopyralid.",NA,,,,,
78,1784,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Malathion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU- Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on malathion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Cheminova A/S. There was also another notifier (Cequisa) according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 703/2001 but it was not possible to reach an agreement and to provide a collective dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005 A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant, which comprises foliar spraying to control various harmful organisms in apples, strawberries, alfalfa and ornamentals at application rate up 1.8 kg malathion per hectare. Malathion can be used as acaricide and insecticide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "" CHA 3110"" (Fyfanon 440""), an oil in water emulsion (EW), registered under different trade names in some EU Member States. Adequate methods are available only for ground water and air to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. malathion. In case of food of plant origin only methods for the determination of malathion and malaoxon are available. No method for the determination of malathion in food of animal origin was submitted. In case of soil and surface water no enforcement method for the determination of malathion is needed due to the fact that the DT90 values are less than 3 days. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available. However, malathion and malaoxon can be determined by a multi-residue method (the applicability of the so-called extent S19 method has been demonstrated). Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The concentration of isomalathion in the batches of technical malathion tested in the toxicological studies is lower than in the specification (between 0.018%-0.44%, if mentioned at all, of the current specification.) The currently supported specification of malathion allows a maximum concentration of 0.2 % (w/w) isomalathion in the technical active substance and according to the FAO specification, it is 0.4 % (w/w). Based on the available studies in the toxicological data package, only the 0.03% isomalathion content can be said to be covered. As for the level of 0.2% isomalathion, an additional safety factor of 10 was added to the ADI and the AOEL in order to be able to conclude on the risk assessment due to uncertainties in studies relevant for the setting of reference values. Furthermore, a data requirement for further genotoxicity studies to be performed has to be fulfilled and a non genotoxic potential demonstrated in order to be able to cover (from a toxicological point of view) the specification of 0.2% of isomalathion in the technical material. The level of isomalathion in the current 5-batch analysis showed a mean content of 0.048-0.076%. This implies that the limit of 0.03% regarding the toxicological data package would not be feasible. Thus, the toxicological assumptions have to be based on the 0.2% limit. Furthermore, it is shown in the FAO specification that the amount of isomalathion even increases during storage both in relation to time and temperature by a factor of 2-10. Thus, the reference values have to be based on the 0.2% level. Malathion is rapidly absorbed and excreted. There is no evidence of accumulation. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by skin, fat, bone and gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites excreted in urine and faeces were primarily the mono and dicarboxylic acids of malathion. Malathion was moderately toxic by the oral route in rat (a classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Malathion is not acutely toxic via the dermal route or through inhalation; it is not irritant to skin and eyes but it is a skin sensitizer (Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact "" is proposed). The target effect in short and long term studies is the decrease of acetyl cholinesterase activities. Overall, malathion does not show genotoxic potential in vivo. The occurrence of nasal tumours was due to a local mechanism of irritancy and cytotoxicity and no classification with regard to carcinogenicity is proposed. Malathion induced a decrease in pup weights; but no classification is proposed. No neurotoxic potential was identified. The reference values were all based on the specification on the content of 0.2% of the impurity isomalathion. Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.03 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 1000. Two Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) values are set. The first ARfD is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day based on available animal data with a safety factor of 100. The second ARfD is based on human data (isomalathion content 0.24%), is 1.5 mg/kg bw, with a safety factor of 10 added. The AOEL is exceeded for high crops (apples) but is below the AOEL for low crops (strawberry and alfalfa), with German model and PPE applied. The estimated exposure is below the AOEL for hand held application as well as indoor applications. Re-entry exposure does not exceed the AOEL except for ornamentals in greenhouse; the exposure of bystanders is below the AOEL only strawberry application. Re-entry exposure does not exceed the AOEL for ornamentals in greenhouse. The estimated exposure is below the AOEL for strawberries and apples after a re-entry interval and when PPE is used. The estimated exposure during use of amateurs exceeds the AOEL. However, until isomalathion is proven non genotoxic, the operator risk assessment cannot be regarded as conclusive. The metabolism of malathion in plants was studied in different crops. Results of those studies indicate that, even though the metabolic pattern appeared being comparable, significant differences in quantity of the formed metabolites, and therewith its relevance regarding consumer exposure, exist. The metabolism of malathion yields the major metabolites malathion mono-and dicarboxylic acid, and desmethyl-malathion; but also, even though at lower levels, malaoxon was identified. Further information to address the toxicological relevance of malathion metabolites are required. With regard to consumer exposure, a number of data gaps have been identified in the expert meeting on residues. It is noted, that there may be additional data gaps resulting from conclusions drawn by experts in other sections, which have an impact on the residue section, but weren't considered by the residues experts at that time. Since there is a lack of data sufficiently addressing the hazard and/or the consumer exposure with regard to residues resulting from malathion use on food/feed crops, the consumer risk assessment cannot be concluded. The available data demonstrate that in soil malathion degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolites malathion monocarboxylic acid (MMCA) malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDCA). Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 5067% AR after 92-162 days incubation at 20-22 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acidified acetonitrile: water followed by methylenene chloride and a methanol Soxhlet extraction or 1N hydrochloric acid followed by acidified acetonitrile and an acetone Soxhlet extraction were 26-41% AR after 92-120 days. In soil malathion and MMCA exhibited very low persistence and MDCA exhibited low persistence. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies malathion exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. MDCA exhibited very high to high mobility with adsorption being pH dependent with lower adsorption at higher soil pH. The adsorption of MMCA could not be measured in batch adsorption studies due to its very rapid degradation. However it is considered it will have high to very high mobility depending on soil pH, based on extrapolation of the results from MDCA. In sediment water systems malathion exhibited very low persistence breaking down to the major metabolites MMCA (which exhibited low persistence) and MDCA (which exhibited medium persistence). All the compounds remained primarily in the water phase of the test sediment water systems. Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 58-69 % AR after 120 days at 20 degrees C. Residues not extracted from sediment by acidified acetonitrile followed by Soxhlet extraction with acetone were also a sink for radioactivity representing 25-36% AR at 120 days. Levels of extractable radioactivity in sediment were relatively low (< 15% AR) at all sampling times. MDCA was the largest proportion of this sediment extractable radioactivity but it accounted for a maximum of only 7.5% AR. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for malathion and its metabolites and the runoff and drainage routes of entry for malathion and it's MMCA metabolite. However MS should carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for MDCA from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, as the EU level assessment did not cover this situation, (although the risk is expected to be low as MDCA has low toxicity to the aquatic organisms tested). The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the representative field uses applied for, for annex 1 listing for malathion and its major soil metabolites MMCA and MDCA is minimal. (This may not be the case for other field uses especially if applications are possible over the late autumn and winter period. The available modelling indicated that in this situation contamination of vulnerable shallow groundwater by MDCA might be expected). A groundwater assessment is not available for the applied for intended use for glasshouse ornamentals. Data are not available to conclude on the risk to birds and mammals following early application in apple orchards. For the late application in apples, and the use in strawberry and alfalafa, the risk to birds and mammals is considered low based on actual residue data, except the long-term risk for a small herbivorous mammal eating short grass in apple orchards. The TER obtained by assuming 30% deposition is 3.9 and the TER obtained based on actual residues in ground vegetation in the residue trial is 3.6, indicating a potential risk. Proposals for refinement have not been peer reviewed and need to be further justified. No exposure of birds and mammals from the use in glasshouses is expected. Risk mitigation measures comparable to at least 50 m are required for the use in apples to protect the aquatic environment following late application in apples. For the early application even larger buffer zones are needed. For strawberry and alfalfa 10 m buffer zones are required. The risk to aquatic organisms from the use on ornamentals in glasshouses is considered low. The toxicity to bees is high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level. For apples and alfalfa no application should be done during flowering. Risk mitigations measures are also needed to protect other non-target arthropods off field. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-and micro-organisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered low.",NA,,,,,
79,1785,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,NA,"Fenamiphos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenamiphos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Irvita. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises application by drip irrigation and ""chisel application"" (spray application followed by incorporation into the soil) in bell-pepper and tobacco, respectively. The application rates are 10 kg fenamiphos per hectare in bell pepper and 6 kg per hectare in tobacco. Fenamiphos can be used as nematicide and insecticide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Nemacur CS 240, a capsule suspension (CS), registered in South Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for a method for fenamiphos-sulfone-phenol in ground water and a method for blood and animal tissues. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Fenamiphos is rapidly and almost completely absorbed within 24 hours. It is extensively metabolised into fenamiphos-phenols. It has a high acute toxicity (therefore, the following classifications were proposed: T+; R28 ""Very toxic if swallowed"", T; R24 ""Toxic in contact with skin"" and T+; R26 ""Very toxic by inhalation""). Fenamiphos was irritating to the eye in rabbits (classification Xi; R36 ""Irritating to eyes"" is proposed). It showed no skin sensitising properties. The relevant short and long term oral no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) are 0.083 mg/kg bw/day and 0.56 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Based on the available in vitro and in vivo tests, fenamiphos is considered not genotoxic. There was no evidence of treatment related increase in carcinogenicity. In a multigeneration study in rats the relevant NOAEL for parental toxicity was 0.17 mg/kg bw/day, the relevant NOAEL for offspring toxicity was 0.64 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant reproductive NOAEL was 2.8 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant NOAEL for developmental effects is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day in a teratogenicity study with rabbits. Fenamiphos showed no potential to induce delayed neuropathy after acute or subchronic administration in hens. The NOAEL for acute neurotoxicity is 0.25 mg/kg bw/day based on clinical signs and decreased erythrocyte cholinesterase in the acute dog study. Some metabolites showed high acute toxicity (LD50 <25 mg/kg bw). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure level (AOEL) are 0.0008 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.0025 mg/kg bw (safety factor - SF- 100). Operator, worker and bystander estimated exposure is below the AOEL (<5%). The behaviour and metabolism of fenamiphos was investigated in a range of crops representing fruity crops, root and tuber crops, leafy crops, oilseeds and pulses as well as different kinds of application. All studies show a similar metabolic pathway in the plants. Fenamiphos is only found directly following application. A short period after treatment, fenamiphos-sulfoxide is the dominant metabolite. In some plants, fenamiphos-sulfone is increasing in time. Therefore, fenamiphos, fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone form the toxicological relevant residue. Residues of fenamiphos in rotation crops were found in soybean, Swiss chard, beet root, wheat green forage and wheat straw planted up to 8 months after treatment. Fruiting vegetables planted as rotational crops are not tested. It is recommended to prescribe a safety interval for planting or sowing rotational crops of 8 months. Furthermore, it is concluded that the rotational crops investigated are not representative for fruiting vegetables and therefore further data is still required. Information on fenamiphos fed to ruminants and poultry is present, but is not relevant for the intended uses on sweet pepper and tobacco. It is concluded that application of fenamiphos on tobacco and sweet pepper following the representative cGAP lead to residue levels on food not giving rise to concern for consumer exposure. However, since there were relevant metabolites found in ground water, a consumer risk assessment was performed, considering the sum of possible intakes of fenamiphos and the metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone from drinking water in addition to the intake through diet. The total intakes from diet and drinking were demonstrated to be significantly above the ADI and ARfD of fenamiphos for the considered consumer subgroups. Fenamiphos is very low or low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions being rapidly oxidized to the major metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone. Fenamiphos-sulfoxide is moderate to high persistent in soil and fenamiphos-sulfone low to moderately persistent. Both organophosphate metabolites are hydrolysed to the major metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol and fenamiphos-sulfone-phenol. These metabolites are subsequently transformed to non extractable residues and mineralized to CO2. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of fenamiphos. Bare soil field dissipation in four Southern European locations with fenamiphos formulated as the representative capsule suspension product (Nemacur 240 CS) was investigated in one study. All major metabolites were found in the 0-10 cm layer and fenamiphos-sulfoxide was also found at deeper layers. Experts' meeting agreed that photolysis was not likely to have affected the degradation rate of fenamiphos and its metabolites in the field trials but leaching could not be completely excluded taking onto account the adsorbtion/desorption properties of these compounds. The data provided after the expert's meeting confirm that the Spanish field trial should not be considered in the assessment of soil compartment and for PEC soil calculations. Experts' meeting agreed with the RMS not to consider Nemacur 240 CS a slow release formulation. New PECs soil have been provided by the RMS in the list of end points to take also into account the application rates of the representative uses and the maximum percentage of metabolites found in the laboratory studies, as agreed by the experts' meeting. According batch adsorption/desorption studies, fenamiphos is low to high mobile whereas fenamiphos-sulfoxide, fenamiphos-sulfone, fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol and fenamiphos-sulfonephenol are medium to very high mobile. No column leaching, field leaching or lysimeter studies are available for fenamiphos. In sterile buffer solutions (pH 5, 7 and 9) at 20 degrees C fenamiphos may be considered stable (DT50 >200 d). Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the transformation of fenamiphos into fenamiphos-sulfoxide. Fenamiphos sulfonic acid was detected as a minor metabolite and fenamiphos-phenolsulfonic acid as a major photolysis metabolite of fenamiphos. This later metabolite shown to be stable to photolysis in water (DT50 = 768 d). The experts' meeting proposed to classify fenamiphos as not ready biodegradable. In water sediment systems fenamiphos dissipated relatively fast from the water phase but may be highly persistent in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 9.3 - 111 d). Major metabolites in water were fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfoxide-phenol. Fenamiphos-sulfoxide was also a major metabolite in the sediment. Mineralization reached a maximum of 2.4-14.3 % AR at the end of the study (100 d) and bound residues reached maximum amounts of 17.4 - 48 % AR. For the representative uses of NEMACUR CS 240 (soil treatment with incorporation and drip irrigation) direct emissions to surface water are not expected. However, emissions via run-off and drainage may not be excluded. RMS presented FOCUS PECSW / (SED) (Steps 1 and 2) calculations for fenamiphos, and initial FOCUS PECSW / (SED) (step 1 and 2) for fenamiphos-sulfoxide, fenamiphossulfoxide- phenol, fenamiphos-phenol-sulfonic acid, fenamiphos-sulfone and fenamiphos-sulfonephenol in an addendum that was discussed in the experts meeting. The meeting agreed that further refinement by FOCUS Step 3 should be provided by the applicant taking into consideration EFSA Opinion on the use of FOCUS SW. For the FOCUS PECGW presented in the original DAR field dissipation half lives were employed as input parameters. The experts' meeting expressed concerns on the use the field dissipation half lives as degradation parameters for modelling in this case. New FOCUS-PEARL calculations, using normalized laboratory half lives, have been provided by the RMS in the list of end points and the updated addendum for the FOCUS scenarios Piacenza, Porto, Sevilla and Thiva. Potential contamination of ground water under vulnerable situations by fenamiphos metabolites over the triggers of 0.1 mu g/L, 0.75 mu g/L and 10 mu g/L may be deduced from these new calculations. Two of the metabolites are relevant. The experts' meeting recognized the difficulty to address potential ground water contamination from protected crop uses with the available scenarios. Since the practices to grow crops under protection are variable among EU a better definition of greenhouse uses is necessary. According to the applicant, NEMACUR CS 240 is used on permanent structures covered with plastic and nets and the crops are planted over the natural soil. The crop is irrigated to satisfy the crop water requirements. With the results of the new FOCUSGW simulations an assessment of the applicability of available FOCUS scenarios for the greenhouse use would be necessary. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half life contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected. For the representative uses evaluated the only potentially relevant routes of bird and mammal exposure are via intake of contaminated soil arthropods, earthworms and fish. Since birds and mammals have no access to permanent glasshouses the only route of exposure from the use on bell peppers is via ingestion of contaminated fish. For the use on tobacco fields exposure via contaminated earthworms and soil arthropods is also possible. The initial risk assessment indicated a high risk for fish-eating birds and mammals from both uses and a high risk for earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the use in tobacco fields. Limited field surveys indicate that earthworms are not present in tobacco fields, but this has to be investigated further. The risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals needs to be refined based on refined PEC surface water data. Fenamiphos and the metabolites fenamiphos-sulfoxide and fenamiphos-sulfone are very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The results from a mesocosm study indicate a potential high risk and the assessment need to be refined based on refined PEC surface water data. The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is considered low from the representative uses evaluated, while a risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organism and micro-organism has been identified and needs to be further addressed. The risk to non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered low.",NA,,,,,1706
80,1786,Lisa,YES,NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.63r,"Phosalone is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosalone in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 7 May 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 6 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Cheminova A/S. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April -May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control chewing and sucking insects in pome fruit (apples, pears) at application rate up to 900 g per hectare. Phosalone can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It should be noted that only the use as insecticide was supported for the EU review programme. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Zolone"" (Rubitox; ""AE F016629 00 EC A1xx""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of phosalone. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Phosalone was found to have a very high acute toxicity when tested by the oral route, and is harmful after acute dermal and inhalative application. It is minimally irritating to skin and eyes and has sensitising properties. The classification proposed is: T, R 25 ""Toxic if swallowed""; Xn, R 20/21 ""Harmful by inhalation and in contact with skin""; Xi, R 43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, the main effect identified was cholinesterase inhibition. Data for phosalone do not support evidence of genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The estimated operator exposure according to the German model is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment is used. The metabolism of phosalone has been investigated in fruits. The metabolism is rather limited and all metabolites formed were found at low levels. Phosalone is the dominant compound of the residue and the residue definition for monitoring is proposed to be phosalone only. One metabolite, oxophosalone, anticipated to be at least as toxic as the parent compound, is included in the residue definition for risk assessment. This metabolite should be toxicologically characterized. Supervised residue trials in apples and pears were submitted, allowing a MRL proposal of 2 mg/kg for pome fruits. The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Although studies in buffer solution demonstrated an extensive degradation under conditions simulating baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosalone seems to be stable under practical conditions of production of apple juice and puree. The reasons for this have not been fully elucidated. The transfer factors to apple juice and puree are very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions. One degradation product observed after processing in buffer solution needs to be investigated for its toxicological relevance as it was not identified in the rat metabolism (2-amino-7chloro- 3H-phenoxazin-3-one). As the intended uses are restricted to pome fruits, studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required. Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosalone through consumption of pomace. Metabolism studies in lactating goat indicated that phosalone is not found in animal tissues. Only metabolites could be identified. The information obtained from the metabolism study in livestock is not sufficient to propose a residue definition and further information is needed on the identification of major residues in animal matrices. From the data submitted it may be expected that some metabolites may be present at measurable levels in animal tissues. The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures to phosalone only. The potential contribution of oxophosalone to the toxicological burden as well as of residues present in animal commodities is not known at this stage. Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn. Considering phosalone only, the acute and chronic exposure assessments, made according to current guidelines, give results below the ADI but may exceed in some cases the ARfD. However, the level of the proposed MRL in pome fruits, which is significantly lower than the level considered in exposure assessments, causes concern in terms of consumer safety. The acute exposure of toddlers may lead to higher exceedance of the ARfD for samples in compliance with the proposed MRL but with high unit to unit variability of residues. Under aerobic conditions phosalone is rapidly metabolised in soil, initially to many minor metabolites, and ultimately to CO2 and soil bound residues. The extensive formation of soil bound residues is rapid and is due in part to the formation of metabolites containing functional groups which are rapidly and tightly bound to organic matter in soil. Under anaerobic conditions the major metabolite AE F114970 (2-amino-5-chlorophenol) was found in the water phase. Phosalone can be classified as very low to low persistent and low to slight mobile in soil. Modelling for the representative uses evaluated indicated that phosalone is unlikely to contaminate groundwater when used as recommended. If released in water, phosalone would adsorb to sediment and particulate matter in the water column and photolysed in the surface layers. Phosalone is relatively stable to transformation by hydrolysis at pH 4 and pH 7, but it is hydrolyzed at pH 9 to metabolites AE0941954 (S-6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2oxo- benzoxazol-3-ylmethyl and AE F054014 (6-chloro-2(3H)-benzoxazolone). Another major metabolite, AE 0651017 (=RP18726, phenoxazone) was found in the water phase of the sediment/water study. PECsw were recalculated based on a safety factor for DT50 value derived from experimental data in order to take into account the pH dependency for hydrolysis of phosalone. PECsw and PECsed calculations for phosalone and metabolite AE 0651017 were based on the critical GAP from the table of representative uses and spray drift loadings. As additional information, contribution to surface water contamination via runoff and drainage was assessed with Exposit model and included in an addendum. Concentration of phosalone in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. A high long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds, considering the blue tit as a focal species. A high acute risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals and a long-term risk to small and medium sized herbivorous mammals, insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. Additionally a high risk was identified for the aquatic environment. Even with a buffer zone of 50 m the TER values are below the agreed trigger value for an available microcosm study. The risk to honey bees is high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level also for flowering weeds below trees in orchards. The available studies indicate a high potential risk to non-target arthropods, both in-field and off-field. Even if phosalone residues on vegetation can be assumed to degrade relatively rapidly allowing for recolonisation, the off- field risk has to be addressed and further data e.g. a field study with predatory mites under the intended conditions is required. Risk mitigation measures at Member State level to protect off- field non-target parasitoids are proposed. Furthermore a new study on one additional arthropod species is required. The acute risk to earthworms is considered low. However, sublethal effects were observed in the acute studies and therefore a long-term reproduction study is required to make sure that phosalone does not cause unacceptable effects on earthworm reproduction. The risk to soil micro organisms, non-target flora and fauna and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is considered low.",NA,,,,,1706
82,1788,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clomazone,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,NA,"Chloridazon is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on chloridazon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 January 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 3 June 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in February March 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises spraying applications between pre seeding respective pre emergence up to crop growth stage BBCH 19 to control important annual broad-leaved weeds in beta beet, onion, shallot, garlic, flowers and nursery in Northern Europe and beta beet in Southern Europe, at application rates max. 2.6 kg chloridazon per hectare. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Pyramin WG"", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. The formulation contains 650 g/kg pure chloridazon. Methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for food of plant origin, water, soil and air, however additional data gap was identified. Analytical methodology is available for the determination of the active substance and the impurities in the technical material as manufactured and for the active substance in the formulation. Additional validation data were submitted but not peer reviewed. Chloridazon is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity, is not irritant to eyes or skin and has no skin sensitising properties. The main findings in short-term oral toxicity studies were dose dependent effects on body weight and liver in rats, mice and dogs and kidney toxicity and effects on the gastric mucosa in dogs at very high dose levels. Chloridazon has neither mutagenic nor genotoxic properties. No evidence of an oncogenic potential was found in rat or mouse. Chloridazon is not teratogenic, has no effects on fertility and is not neurotoxic. The estimated operator exposure does not exceed the AOEL according to the German model even when no personal protective equipment is worn. In root crops chloridazon is metabolised through cleavage of the phenyl ring, leading to metabolite B (5-amino-4-chloropyridazin-3(2H)-one). This metabolite is generally present in mature commodities at higher levels than those of the parent compound. The proposed residue definition for monitoring is the sum of both compounds. Their conjugates need to be considered for risk assessment. MRLs ranging from 0.2 to 3 mg chloridazon/kg are proposed for crops selected as representative uses. Following uptake from the soil by rotational crops, residues of the parent compound and its metabolite B may be present at quantifiable levels in foliar plant parts. Only cereals, root or tuber crops are possible to be grown as rotational crops with residues below the limit of quantification in their parts used for human consumption. Residue trials under field conditions would be necessary to set MRLs on other potential rotational crops. A transfer of residues of metabolite B to animal commodities is possible up to 0.1 mg/kg in the case of ruminants fed with feed items produced from treated sugar beets or (rotational) cereal fodder or straw. The risk assessment based on the representative uses did not show any concern for the consumer, even considering the possible use as drinking water of groundwater containing residues of metabolites B and B 1. Chloridazon is low to high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions, with degradation characterized by a rapid mineralization to CO2 of the phenyl moiety and a slow to moderate mineralization of the pyridazon moiety. Chloridazon was primarily degraded to its main metabolite B, which contains the pyridazinon ring part of the molecule. A part from insignificant metabolism/degradation, the further fate of metabolite B consisted predominantly in the formation of high amounts of bound residues, whereas only a moderate amounts are converted to metabolite B-1. Ultimate aerobic degradation of both metabolites B and metabolite B-1 was negligible. Both metabolites were shown to be of medium to high persistence in soil. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of chloridazon in soil and in water. Batch equilibrium adsorption/desorption studies indicated that chloridazon is medium to high mobile in soil, metabolite B is high to very high mobile and metabolite B-1 is medium to very high mobile. Results from the lysimeter studies confirmed that metabolites B and B-1 have a high leaching potential. Chloridazon was stable to sterile aqueous hydrolysis at environmentally relevant pH values. In water-sediment systems chloridazon dissipated slowly from the water phase. Metabolite B was the only major metabolite in the water phase and is considered stable. Ultimate biodegradation was negligible with moderate transformation to bound residues. Predicted environmental concentrations of chloridazon in surface water (PECSW) and sediment (PECsed) resulting from pre-emergence spray application on sugar beet and bulb vegetables were recalculated for chloridazon and its metabolite B using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach. New PECg, were provided after the DAR was finalised. Results for metabolites B and B-1 showed that unacceptable leaching to groundwater is very likely to occur. PECgw after application every third year exceeded 10 [tg/L in 5 out of 9 scenarios for metabolite B, and exceeded 0.75 [tg/L in all 9 scenarios for metabolite B-1. Long range transport in air and deposition of chloridazon may be considered negligible. The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for the representative uses in a first-tier risk assessment. However the long-term TERs for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. The refined risk assessment based on focal species, PT and PD refinement was discussed in the expert meeting and data gaps were identified to justify the suggested refinements (e.g. focal species lapwing and grey partridge and PT values). On the basis of the available information a high long-term risk to birds cannot be excluded. The refined long-term risk assessment for mammals based on measured residues and hare as a focal species was accepted by the expert meeting. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low except for algae where some of the run-off scenarios (R3 use in beet, R3 and R4 use in bulb vegetables) resulted in FOCUS step3 PECsw leading to TERs below the trigger of 10. Member States in which run-off is an important route of entry into surface water need to consider the risk to aquatic organisms further. The risk from the metabolites B and B1 to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.",NA,,,,,1706
83,1789,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance prosulfocarb,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,NA,"Prosulfocarb is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on prosulfocarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence or early post -emergence herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise conventional field crop spraying to control grass weeds (Apera spica-venti, Poa annua, Poa trivialis, Alopecurus myosuroides, Lolium multi/Thrum) and broad-leaved weeds (Galium aparine, Stellaria media, Lamium purpureum, Fumaria officinalis, Solanum nigrum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium album, Thlaspi arvense, Veronica spp., Capsella bursa-pastoris, Myosotis arvensis, Anthemis spp., Viola arvensis) in winter wheat and potatoes (a maximum rate of 4 kg as/ha). The representative formulated products for the evaluation was ""Boxer"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 800 g/L prosulfocarb. The technical specification is still open waiting for confirmatory data. Adequate methods are available to monitor prosulfocarb in the respective residue definitions. Residues of prosulfocarb in food and feed of plant origin can be determined by a multi method (DFG Method-S19) using GC-MSD and in soil, water and air by GC-MSD. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The acute oral toxicity of prosulfocarb is moderate while the acute dermal or inhalation toxicity is low. Slight signs of skin-and ocular irritation were noted in rabbits, and skin sensitisation was shown in mice. In short-term toxicity studies, liver and kidney were found to be the target organs in rats and dogs. In addition, haemolytic anaemia was observed in dogs, with associated histopathological findings in the bone marrow and spleen. Available data do not support evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic effects. In long-term toxicity studies, mainly reduced food consumption and decreased body weights were noted. No toxic effect on the reproductive parameters was demonstrated. However, there was some evidence of teratogenic potential but no convincing evidence for classification and adequate margins of safety were shown for the reference values. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/d, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) is 0.007 mg/kg bw/d and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw. The level of operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment according to a field study. Applied according to the representative uses in wheat and potatoes, prosulfocarb is extensively metabolised and in mature commodities no metabolite structurally related to the compound was identified. The ultimate degradation products are expected to be incorporated in the endogenous metabolism of the plant. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is proposed to consist per default in prosulfocarb. MRLs for wheat and potatoes can be set at the Limit of Quantification. No residues are expected in rotational crops, processed plant commodities and in animal commodities. No risk for the consumer resulting from the use of prosulfocarb according to the representative uses is expected. In soil under aerobic conditions prosulfocarb exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide2 (observed in studies at a maximum of 7.2% of prosulfocarb on a mass basis) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 38 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 27 % AR after 96 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions degradation was slower than under aerobic conditions but no novel breakdown products were identified. Prosulfocarb exhibits low to slight mobility in soil, prosulfocarb sulfoxide exhibits high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either prosulfocarb or prosulfocarb sulfoxide was pH dependant. In natural sediment water systems prosulfocarb dissipated quite rapidly from water by partitioning to sediment where it subsequently degraded slowly exhibiting high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was the only significant degradation product accounting for 15-25 % AR at 70-107 days. Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink for radioactivity representing 7.3-23 % AR at study end (107 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for prosulfocarb at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Additionally at step 4, for the runoff scenarios the applicant presented calculations where both spray drift and runoff were mitigated. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.41g/L by parent prosulfocarb and its minor soil metabolite prosulfocarb sulfoxide, was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The first-tier acute and short-term TERs for birds were above the trigger value of 10 but the longterm trigger of 5 was breached. The suggested risk refinements based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD) were agreed in the meeting of experts. For mammals, the first tier acute TER was below the trigger of 10 for the small herbivore and all first tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5. As for birds, the refined risk assessment for mammals, based on rate of decline of residues in plants, focal species and proportion of different food items in the diet (PD), were agreed in the meeting of experts. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since exposure of birds and mammals from contaminated drinking water was expected to be low. The accumulation of water in leaf axils and puddle formation were considered as unlikely since the product is applied at very early growth stages and sprayed at low volumes. A potential high risk was indicated for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in earthworms resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5. The TERs for fish, daphnids and algae were about one order of magnitude below the trigger values of 100 and 10 based on FOCUS step 2 PECsw. No full FOCUS step3 scenario resulted in PECsw values low enough to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for all groups of aquatic organisms. Based on endpoints from laboratory studies, TERs below the Annex VI triggers were observed with FOCUS step 4 PECsw (10 m no spray buffer zone) in the scenarios D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, R1, R3, R4 (8 out of 9) for the use in winter wheat and in the scenarios R1, R2, R3 (3 out of 6) for the use in potato. Therefore it is concluded that a 10 m no-spray buffer zone is not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure in the majority of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS scenarios. Two mesocosm studies were submitted to refine the risk to aquatic organisms. The robustness of the results of the first study was questioned during the peer-review process. The experts in the PRAPeR meeting agreed that a NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L could be derived from the new mesocosm study. No agreement was reached during the expert meeting on the safety factor which should be applied to the endpoint. If a safety factor of >3 is applied then the NOEAEC of 15 fig prosulfocarb/L would become the critical endpoint driving the risk assessment. The HQ values indicated a potential high in-field and off-field risk to non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies resulted in LR50s below the suggested application rate of 4 kg prosulfocarb/ha but the LR50s were higher than the expected exposure at lm distance from the treated field. Therefore it was concluded by the expert meeting that recolonisation of the in-field area is likely to occur and the overall risk to non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed. The TER values for non-target plants were calculated as 3 and 28 for pre-and post-emergence treatment. The use of an interception factor to estimate the pre emergence exposure and the suggested lowering of the safety factor was not agreed by the expert meeting. Risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 5 m was recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.",NA,,,,,1706
84,1790,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.111r,"Prothioconazole is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC' United Kingdom received an application from Bayer CropScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/35/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on prothioconazole, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 18 October 2004. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 21 October 2004. The peer review was initiated on 21 October 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in January 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar application to wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oats and oilseed rape and as a seed treatment to the same crops excluding oilseed rape. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. There are two representative formulated products evaluated Proline an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation and Redigo a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) formulation. Methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, water, soil and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi method (The German S19 method has been validated for prothioconazole-desthio). Only single methods are available to determine residues of prothioconazole-desthio, in products of animal origin and prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio in soil water and air. A method is not available to monitor the glucuronide conjugate in products of animal origin. Also if the active is classified as toxic then methods for body fluids and tissues would need to be considered. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methods for the relevant impurities in the formulation are not available. Prothioconazole is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity; it does not show any eye and skin irritation or sensitising potential. The relevant short term oral NOAEL is 25 mg/kg bw/day and the chronic NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day (the liver being the main target organ with increases in hepatic enzyme activity, increased liver weights and hepatocellular hypertrophy were consistent with hepatic enzyme induction). Prothioconazole does not show in vivo genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant reproductive NOAEL is 95.6 mg/kg bw/day, while the developmental NOAEL is 20 mg/kg bw/day. In rats, an increased incidence of microphthalmia was observed at the high dose level. The increased incidence of rudimentary supernumerary ribs at the high dose level was also considered to be treatment related. Hence, prothioconazole was proposed to be classified as Repro cat 3, R 63 (Repro cat 2?), based on the increased incidences of microphthalmia (at 1000 mg/kg, maternal toxic dose) in one out of two rat strains tested. Prothioconazole did not show toxicity to the nervous system. The proposed ADI for prothioconazole is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, and the ARM and AOEL are 0.2 mg/kg bw. The estimated operator exposure to the 250 EC formulation is below the AOEL when PPE is worn for mechanical spraying in cereals, using the UK-POEM and the German model. The exposure of operators working at the treatment of seeds with the prothioconazole FS formulation accounts for about 45% of the AOEL for operators performing mixing/loading/calibration/cleaning and bagging. For sowing, the estimated exposure is about 2% of the AOEL. The exposure of workers after spraying in cereals is about 45% of the AOEL. Estimated exposure of bystanders is negligible The main metabolite prothioconazole-desthio, M04, is considered relevant. An ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/day (liver histopathology and reduced weight gain in the rat carcinogenicity study), applying a 100 fold assessment factor. The ARM was discussed in the experts' meeting: the experts agreed on the NOAEL from the rat developmental study (1 mg/kg bw/day), based on an increase in supernumerary ribs at 3 mg/kg bw/day, with a SF 100. The same value of 0.01 mg/kg bw was considered as an AOEL. M04 was toxic for the development in rats and rabbits and the classification Repro.cat.2, R61 was proposed by the experts. The metabolism of prothioconazole has been fully investigated in cereals, oilseeds, rotational crops as well as in livestock and mainly proceeds through oxidative reactions. In most plant parts and animal tissues, the major compound of the metabolic pattern is prothioconazole-desthio, which is more toxic than the parent compound. Given the complex plant and animal metabolic pattern and to reflect adequately the toxicological burden the consumer is exposed to, the residue definition for risk assessment in all commodities is the sum of prothioconazole-desthio and all metabolites containing the 2-(1-chlorocyclopropy1)-3-(2-chloropheny1)-2-hydroxypropyl-2H-1,2,4-triazole moiety, expressed as prothioconazole-desthio. This residue definition for risk assessment is however provisional as beside the metabolites which are structurally related to the parent compound, cereal grains, oilseeds, rotational crops and animal products are expected to contain significant amounts of non specific triazole derivative metabolites. These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007. The monitoring of plant and animal commodities can be targeted on prothioconazole-desthio, but in animal tissue, its glucuronide conjugate needs to be included in the analysis. A sufficient amount of data has been submitted in order to set MRLs. Chronic and acute consumer exposures are well below the respective toxicological trigger values allocated to prothioconazole-desthio. This assessment was conducted on the basis of the provisional residue definition for risk assessment and does not cover the triazole derivative metabolites. A robust conclusion on the risk for the consumer cannot be finalised at this stage. Information on the actual level of those derivatives in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is lacking. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class whose degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring. The available studies on the environmental fate and behaviour of prothioconazole indicated that there is no potential for persistence or accumulation of prothioconazole and its degradation products in the environmental compartments. Prothioconazole is of low persistence in soil in both laboratory and field studies (lab DT50 = 0.07-1.27 days; field DT50 = 1.3-2.8 days, median = 1.6 day). The major metabolites formed in soil, i.e. prothioconazole-desthio (M04, max. 49.4% AR) and prothioconazoleS-methyl (M01, max. 14.6% AR), are more persistent (in laboratory studies DT50 for MO1 = 5.9-46.0 days, and DT50 for M04 = 7.0-34.0 days). Under field conditions, the dissipation time for prothioconazole-desthio was estimated to be in the range of 16.3-72.3 days. In all field trials no residues of prothioconazole or of its metabolites were detected below 20 cm depth of soils. These findings confirmed the results obtained from different laboratory mobility studies, which showed that prothioconazole is of low mobility (K0. = 1765 mLig, determined in aged column leaching study), as well as prothioconazole-S-methyl and prothioconazole-desthio (Kf0. = 1974 - 2995 mL/g and 523 625 mLig, respectively). Exposure assessment with FOCUS-PELMO model indicated that no concerns related to groundwater contamination by prothioconazole or its metabolite prothioconazoledesthio (M04) and prothioconazole-S-methyl (M01) are to be expected. From soil photolysis studies, there appeared to be no significant influence of light on the rate of degradation of prothioconazole. Prothioconazole is considered stable to hydrolysis and hydrolytic breakdown will not contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole in the aquatic environment. Whenever surface water will be contaminated by the parent compound, solar radiation may contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole via phototransformation reactions (predicted environmental half-life under June solar summer conditions of 11 days in Athens, Greece). Prothioconazole-desthio (M04) was identified as the main photolytic degradation product (max. 56% AR). Other two major degradation products were identified as prothioconazole-thiazocine (M12) at 14% AR and 1,2,4-triazole (M13) at 12% AR. Taking into account the fast dissipation of prothioconazole from the water phase (DT5owater = 0.8-1.0 days at 20 degrees C in the dark) observed in a water/sediment study, it is unlikely that prothioconazolethiazocine (M12) will be formed at >10% in natural surface water systems under realistic environmental conditions. 1,2,4-triazole (M13) shows no light adsorption above 290 nm and is regarded as stable to photolytic degradation in water. Prothioconazole rapidly disappeared from two aerobic natural water/sediment systems, with a calculated half-life of 1.6-2.8 days referring to the whole system. A proportion of prothioconazole partitioned quite rapidly into the sediment (max 22.623.4% AR in the sediment on day 1), but there is also rapid degradation to prothioconazole-desthio (M04), which can also partition into sediment (max 26.9% AR). Another metabolite exceeding 10% of the applied radioactivity in the water layer was identified as L2,4-triazole (M13, max. 37.2% AR). No DT50 values for metabolites were available. Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsw) and sediment (PECsed) were estimated for prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio (M04) and 1,2,4-triazole (no PECsed calculations provided as not being a major metabolite in sediment) assuming spray drift from the maximum three recommended foliar applications. Based on the results concerning vapour pressure, Henry Law constant and photo oxidative stability in ambient air, it can be concluded that neither emission of prothioconazole into the air, nor accumulation and contamination by wet or dry deposition are to be expected for the parent compound and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (M04). The risk to birds and mammals from the use of prothioconazole as a foliar application in cereals and oilseed rape is considered to be low. The assessment of long-term risk for birds and mammals from the use as cereal seed treatment indicates a high risk based on the available and peer reviewed data and information. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input comparable to 5 m spray free buffer zones are required to protect the aquatic environment based on the currently evaluated data and information. EFSA recommends that the available full life cycle study with the metabolite prothioconazole-desthio is evaluated before a final conclusion on the risk to fish is drawn. Furthermore, bioconcentration of prothioconazole-S-methyl should be considered at Member State level should MS surface water exposure assessment show that this metabolite may contaminate surface water from drainage and/or run-off. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non -target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low",NA,,,,,1706
85,1791,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clomazone,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.109r,"Clomazone is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clomazone in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 16 March 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 11 July 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in June July 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on oilseed rape, for full details of the GAP please see the attached endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Centium 36 CS"", a capsule suspension (CS). Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For air there is a single method available that analysed for clomazone. Soil and water methods were provided however, they appear to contain a hydrolysis step and will therefore not be specific to clomazone. Several methods were provided for soil and water metabolites however, no conclusion was made on the acceptability of the validation data during the peer review process. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Clomazone has a moderate acute toxicity by inhalation and if swallowed, it is not irritating to skin and eyes, and is not a skin sensitiser. In repeat dose studies, the liver was the target organ for all the species. The compound is not genotoxic, not carcinogenic, and has no reproductive or developmental effect. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level are both 0.133 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The 100% default value for the dermal absorption was used, resulting in operator exposure estimates below the AOEL when gloves are used during mixing/loading and application. Metabolism studies with pre-emergence treatment were conducted in tobacco, sweet potatoes and soy bean. In addition, there are two studies on cotton and alfalfa with post-emergence application, covering different plant parts. The metabolism is considered to be similar in the evaluated crops. It would therefore be possible, to propose a general residue definition for all plant products. However, the most abundant plant metabolite, 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol, was not found in rat metabolism, and it could not be demonstrated that it is of lower toxicity than clomazone. The latter was almost completely degraded and, if present, only at low levels. At current, i.e. with respect to the representative uses evaluated, the amount of neither, clomazone and 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol, will be significant in food and feed items (i.e. below the trigger values). Therefore, with respect to the representative uses the relevant residue should be defined by default as clomazone. Further data and information on 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol will be needed in order to render possible a generally applicable plant residue definition. Metabolism studies in livestock animals are not necessary since residues in potential feedstuff is <0.1 mg/kg. Studies in succeeding crops or rotational crops are not required. Based on the currently available information it was assessed that no residues in rotational crops are expected after treatment of the primary crops according to critical GAP. A sufficient number of valid residue trials covering the relevant European growing areas allow for an MRL proposal for potato tubers and rape seed. Independently of the model used, the chronic consumer intake form the representative uses is estimated to be well below the ADI. (<1%). No ARfD is proposed and therefore an acute risk to consumers is not expected. Under laboratory aerobic conditions clomazone is moderate to high persistent in soil. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 31.5% AR and unextracted soil residues accounted for 15.2% AR. No major metabolite exceeding 10% of the applied radioactivity was detected in the laboratory soil metabolism studies. Under anaerobic conditions, the major metabolite N-R2-chlorobenzy01-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl propanamide was detected. In a laboratory soil batch adsorption/desorption study clomazone exhibited low to high mobility in soil. The aquatic degradation of clomazone was studied in two water/sediment studies and was shown to degrade relatively slowly in both systems. Two major metabolites FMC 65317 (N-R2-chlorobenzy013-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl propanamide) and FMC 55657 (N-[(2-chlorobenzyl)]-2-methyl propanamide were found in the water phase. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift, runoff and drainage routes of entry for clomazone. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling is based on the longest degradation rate in soil as the recommended input value by FOCUS GW scenario guidance for PEC calculations with a number of 3 values for the parent compound. For the representative field uses applied for, the potential for groundwater exposure by clomazone above the drinking water limit of 0.1[Ig/L is low, except for regions with geoclimatic conditions represented by the Piacenza and Okehampton FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Studies were available to asses the risk to non-target organisms. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil macro- and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was concluded to be low. Risk mitigation comparable to a 5 m buffer zone is required to protect non-target plants outside the treated field.",NA,,,,,1706

Each experimental group contained 10 healthy larvae and was exposed to different concentrations of technical and formulation grade malathion for 96 h. Concentrations of malathion that caused 50% mortality (LC50) at 96 h were estimated using a probit analysis program. The results showed that formulation grade malathion (LC50 = 29 ppm) was more toxic than technical grade malathion (LC50 = 38 ppm).

Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Herold SC 600"", an aqueous suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names containing diflufenican and flufenacet. The main notifier submitted two representative uses and formulations, however the RMS and the main notifier agreed to evaluate only ""Herold SC 600"". Adequate methods are available to monitor diflufenican residues in plants, foodstuff of plant and animal origin, soil, water and air. Residues in food of plant and animal origin can be determined with the German multi-residue method DFG S19. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of diflufenican. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Concerning the mammalian toxicology assessment, diflufenican has a low acute toxicity, is not irritant and has no skin sensitisation potential. In repeat dose studies, the main adverse effects were on the body weight gain and in the liver. No concern was raised about the genotoxic properties of diflufenican, and no carcinogenic potential was demonstrated. In the multigeneration study, incidences of dystocia were observed at the high dose but were concomitant with systemic toxicity and did not lead to classification. No teratogenic activity was shown in the developmental studies. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.2 mg/kg bw/day and the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.11 mg/kg bw/day, both with the use of a safety factor 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not required. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The metabolism of diflufenican was investigated in wheat upon pre- and post-emergence application. The application rate and timing used in the plant metabolism study correspond to the notified GAP criteria. In the wheat grains, diflufenican could be detected but an extensive identification of metabolites was difficult due to the low residue levels. In straw, again diflufenican was identified; however the major part of the total residue consisted of different metabolites that, with one exception, were not identified since individually not present above the trigger value of 0.01 mg/kg. The meeting of experts noted that for future cereal uses that deviate from the assessed GAP additional metabolism data may be required in order to refine the residues definition, currently proposed as diflufenican. The metabolism and distribution of diflufenican in rotational crops was investigated in wheat, cabbage and sugar beet. Two metabolites, AE 0542291(2) and AE B107137(3) could be identified since they presented a substantial part of the total residue in the tested crops. Eventually, the two metabolites were not considered to be of concern for the consumer. The experts concluded that for the particular notified use and GAP it is not expected to get residue levels in rotational crops exceeding the trigger value of 0.01 mg/kg. A very limited number of residue trials support the notified GAP. In addition, residue trials are available with an increased latest time of application, and it was proposed to use these trials to support the notified GAP. The data allow for an MRL proposal for cereal grains on LOQ level. Based on the residue trial data livestock exposure is possible through straw used in animal diet, in particular in ruminant diet. No exposure of poultry is expected. However, the metabolism and distribution in animals was investigated in lactating cows and chickens. As for the assessed representative use it was concluded that no residues of diflufenican above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are likely to occur in edible animal matrices and thus no feeding studies and no MRLs for animal products are considered necessary. The chronic dietary risk assessment for consumers showed that exposure to residues of diflufenican from the notified use is well below the allocated ADI. As no ARfD was derived an acute risk assessment is not required. Under dark aerobic conditions at 20 - 22 degrees C, diflufenican was moderate to high persistent in soil. Two major soil aerobic metabolites were identified, AE 0542291 and AE B107137 that are moderately persistent in soil. Mineralization was from 3.85 % AR after 120 d to a maximum of 51.2 % AR after 52 d depending on the study and the labelling position. Unextractable residues range from 3.04 % AR after 120 d to 18.5 % AR after 54 d depending on the study and the labelling position. Diflufenican is medium to very high persistent under anaerobic conditions. Volatile transformation product 2,4-difluroaniline (AE C522392) was identified as a major anaerobic metabolite. Degradation of AE B107137 was also investigated under anaerobic conditions. Diflufenican is shown to be stable to the photolysis in soil. Field studies in six German sites and six sites in different European locations (UK, FR, DE, NL, ES and IT) show that diflufenican was high to very high persistent under field conditions. A kinetic analysis of the two field studies to obtain field normalized half lives is also available. In a five years accumulation study conducted at six sites in south-east England (Maycey and Savage, 1991a) a clear tendency to accumulation of diflufenican residues was observed. Since soil concentration derived from the field accumulation study was higher than the obtained from standard calculation this value was used for the ecotoxicological risk assessment and the calculation of the potential maximum concentration of the metabolites. Diflufenican is slight mobile to immobile in soil, AE B107137 is very highly mobile and AE 0542291 is medium to highly mobile. Diflufenican and its metabolite AE B107137 were stable to hydrolysis. Diflufenican was also stable to aqueous photolysis and non ready biodegradable. Degradation of diflufenican in dark water sediment was investigated in a total of four systems. The application rate used in these studies is significantly above of the solubility limit. Diflufenican was medium to very high persistent in these systems and was slowly transformed to the metabolite AE B107137. In all the water sediment systems available mineralization was negligible (< 4 % A R after 120 d). Data from these studies were analyzed in a separated study by multicompartmental kinetic models. Whereas these fitting exercises are able to describe the system as a whole the individual degradation rates for the water phase should be taken with caution. The values obtained from this kinetic analysis were employed in the FOCUS SW modelling presented in the DAR. In a sediment monitoring study performed in UK winter cereal areas with history of repeated use of diflufenican at rates below 100 g / ha variable results were obtained. Different FOCUS PECSW/SED are available in the DAR and in the Addendum, none of them produced with the input parameters agreed by the expert's meeting. However, the expert's meeting decided to retain the PECSW / SED values presented in the DAR for the EU risk assessment. Examination of the modelling results and the ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that Step 4 calculation with a 5 m buffer for spray drift only resulted in a complete scenario with acceptable TERs for aquatic risk assessment (D3). After the expert meeting, EFSA identified a data GAP for new FOCUS PECSW calculations using a plant uptake factor of zero and the input parameters agree for the meeting (mean whole systems half life for SW and 1000 d for sediment, with only spray drift buffer strip mitigation in order to confirm the proposed risk assessment and to make it consistent with the risk assessments performed for other substances of this peer review phase. Potential ground water contamination by diflufenican and the soil metabolites AE B107137 and AE 0542291 was evaluated by FOCUS PELMO (v. 3.3.2). The 80th percentile annual average concentrations in leachates below 1 m were predicted to be less than 0.001 mu g/L for all compounds in the nine European scenarios. Diflufenican may be considered slightly volatile. However, based on the negligible potential for volatilization from plant and soil surface it is considered that exposure to air and therefore long range transport thought air is insignificant for diflufenican. During expert's meeting soil anaerobic metabolite 2,4-difluroaniline was found to be very volatile and may need to be assessed for the air compartment and for transport through air when anaerobic conditions are expected to occur. The Annex VI triggers were met in the acute and long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals taking into consideration only exposure to diflufenican. However the lead formulation Herold SC 600 contains flufenacet as a second active substance. The toxicity and exposure to the second active substance was not taken into account in the risk assessment. The long-term TER for herbivorous mammals of 5.3 is close to the trigger of 5. It is likely that the TER would be below the trigger if exposure to the second active substance is considered in the risk assessment. A risk assessment taking into consideration also exposure to flufenacet is required before a conclusion can be drawn on the risk to birds and mammals from the representative use of diflufenican formulated as Herold SC 600. Green algae were the most sensitive organisms driving the aquatic risk assessment. Only the FOCUS step4 part scenario D5 pond reached a TER of > 10 including a no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres indicating a high risk to aquatic organisms for the majority of geoclimatic conditions in Europe presented by the FOCUS scenarios. However the risk to aquatic organisms is addressed for the full FOCUS step 4 scenario D3 (ditch) if the approach is followed which was agreed in the meeting of experts on ecotoxicology. It may be possible to identify further scenarios with acceptable risk if recovery is taken into account as suggested in the addendum from April 2007 or if larger no-spray buffer zones are introduced in the PECsw calculations. The RMS stated in the not peer-reviewed addendum from August 2007 that a new risk assessment was submitted by the applicant but the risk assessment was not summarised and evaluated in the addendum. The aquatic risk assessment was based on exposure to diflufenican alone. However tests with the formulation Herold SC 600 suggest lower toxicity to green algae (the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms tested) compared to technical diflufenican. Therefore it was agreed in the expert meeting that the risk from the formulation would be covered by the risk assessment for diflufenican. The in-field and off-field HQ values for Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri were below the trigger of 2 based on studies with formulations different from Herold SC 600. Studies with the formulation Herold SC 600 indicated a high risk to T. pyri. No studies with the lead formulation and non-target arthropods other than T. pyri were made available. The risk to non-target arthropods was not sufficiently addressed for the suggested representative use. Consequently a data gap was identified by the experts to address the risk to non-target arthropods from the formulation Herold SC 600. The risk to non-target plants from pre-emergence and post-emergence exposure to diflufenican was assessed as high and risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 10 meters is required. The risk to bees, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA,,,,,1706
91,1797,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.119r,"Bifenox is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 25 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Feinchemie Schwebda. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant on winter wheat and barley, full details of the gap can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Milan"", a suspension concentrate (SC), the formulation also contains another active substance pyraflufen-ethyl. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition where these could be set. Residues in cereals can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bifenox in soil and air and bifenox and aminobifenox acid(2) in water. The ground water residue definition is not finalised and further methods for bifenox acid may be required. Also it is not yet clear if methods will be required for products of animal origin. Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The technical specification can not be agreed on at this time as the analytical data do not support the proposed values. In mammalian metabolism studies oral absorption of bifenox occurred in the first 48 hours after dosing and is sex and dose dependent. Bioavailability reached 29% and 53% in male and female rats respectively, after a single oral low dose. When the dose was increased, urinary excretion was reduced suggesting saturation of absorption. Based on urinary excretion, oral absorption is estimated to be 25%. No potential for accumulation was observed. Metabolism occurred by nitro-reduction and O-demethylation. Acute oral toxicity of bifenox is low in rats, however, classification with Xn, R22-Harmful if swallowed, is required based on the oral LD50 found in mice (1540 and 1780 mg/kg bw in males and females respectively). No classification is required for dermal or inhalation toxicity; bifenox is not a skin or eye irritant and is not a skin sensitizer. Animals exposed to bifenox developed mild signs of porphyria as suggested by small-altered blood parameters (in rats and dogs), kidney toxicity (rat), and some altered clinical chemistry, which could suggest hepatotoxicity (rat and dog). Bifenox showed no potential for genotoxicity. Upon long-term exposure, no clear toxic effects were demonstrated in either rats or mice, which was found a limitation factor by the experts of PRAPeR 19 to conclude on the carcinogenic potential of bifenox; according to the available results, no carcinogenic potential was observed. Bifenox produced no adverse effects on fertility, slight/marginal effects on reproduction/development were observed at parental toxic doses, and no teratogenic effects were seen. No potential for neurotoxicity was evidenced. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) at 0.5 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.125 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 400 (correction of 25% for oral absorption). Dermal absorption was 1% when handling the concentrate representative formulation ( Milan) and 4% when handling an in-use field dilution. According to the representative uses of Milan, and considering only the bifenox component of the formulation, the estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves during mixing/loading and application are used according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure was below the AOEL even without the use of PPE. Exposure of workers and bystanders was estimated to be also below the AOEL. The metabolism of bifenox was investigated in winter wheat. Upon an early application (BBCH 13) bifenox was extensively and completely metabolised through hydroxylation into bifenox acid(3) and the major metabolite hydroxybifenox acid(4) followed by conjugation with glucose. Identification of metabolites was based on residues in straw as the residues in grains were very low. The results of supervised residue trials indicated that, when bifenox is applied at a later growth stage (BBCH 29), unchanged bifenox is still a significant residue in straw. As the notified GAP allows for applications between BBCH 13 and 29, a significant variation in the composition of the residues may occur. Hydroxybifenox acid was not found in the rat and therefore it could not be concluded whether it needs to be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. The experts of PRAPeR 20 concluded that the levels of hydroxybifenox acid residues that could be expected in cereal crops having received an early application were not sufficiently addressed by residue trial data and further trials are needed. In a rotational crop study significant residue levels were found in edible crops parts. However, the study had some draw backs that didn't allow finalising the assessment of whether these residues are relevant for consumer and livestock exposure and therefore further data are required. Significant residue may also occur in the diet of ruminants; however no livestock metabolism data were submitted that would address the nature of potentially occurring residues in food of animal origin. In an available feeding study with goats, only milk was analysed for residues of bifenox, but residue levels and the potential of accumulation in tissues and organs was not investigated. Bifenox is considered a fat soluble compound. Therefore further data are required to address residues in food of animal origin. The consumer dietary intake and risk assessment cannot be finalised pending data submission to address the identified data gaps. While the consumer exposure to residues of bifenox in grains (all below the LOQ) is expected to be insignificant (< 1% of the ADI and ARfD respectively), the exposure to residues in food of animal origin and rotated crops cannot be assessed due to lack of data. In soil under aerobic conditions bifenox exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolite bifenox acid (accounting for up to 79% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and nitrophenyl rings to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 3.8-8% AR after 90-92 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 28-41 % AR after 90-92 days. Bifenox is immobile or exhibits low mobility in soil, bifenox acid exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenox or bifenox acid was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems bifenox degraded exhibiting low persistence in both water and sediment to the metabolite aminobifenox(5) in sediment which exhibited moderate persistence and to aminobifenox acid in water. In mesocosm studies (light exposed) low levels of 2,4-dichlorophenol were produced which exhibited low persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.9 % AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 60-64 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenox at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites aminobifenox, aminobifenox acid, 2,4-dichlorophenol and [ bifenox acid that may leach from soil to surface water] appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by bifenox above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolite bifenox acid, in geoclimatic regions represented by the Okehampton and Piacenza FOCUS groundwater scenarios contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit cannot be excluded and a metabolite non relevance assessment was triggered for this metabolite. The conclusion of this assessment using the available toxicological information was that bifenox acid was not relevant with respect to groundwater. However information on pesticidal activity of bifenox acid against target weeds is required before the groundwater non relevance assessment can be finalised. The acute and long-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals were assessed as low in the first tier-risk assessment. The long-term risk to mammals needed refinement. The suggested refinement based on wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) as a focal species and the PD and measured residues were accepted by the meeting of experts but not the suggested PT values. The long-term TER of 5 is not met without PT refinement. Therefore, a data gap for submission of further data to refine the risk was identified in the experts' meeting. Bifenox is very toxic to aquatic organisms with algae driving the risk assessment. No TER met the Annex VI trigger based on FOCUS step3 PECsw. A mesocosm study was submitted. A NOAEC of 4 mu g bifenox/L and a safety factor of 2-3 was agreed in the meeting of experts. Risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 10 m is required to achieve a TER of > 3 and a no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to achieve TERs > 2 for all FOCUS step4 scenarios. A range of non-target arthropods was tested. Typhlodromus pyri reacted very sensitive in the standard glass-plate test. In an extended laboratory study it was shown that adverse effects in the off-field area are <50%. Hence the risk to predatory mites was considered to be sufficiently addressed. A long-term/reproduction study with bifenox and earthworms was not considered necessary since the DT90 values were in the range of 28-107 days and only one application per year is proposed. However a chronic study with another formulation containing additionally two other active substances was submitted by the applicant. No effects were observed at the highest tested application rate which is about 5 times the suggested field rate. No long-term/reproduction study with earthworms was submitted for the metabolite bifenox acid for which DT90 values ranged from 80-517 days. It is very likely that bifenox-acid was formed in the long-term test with the formulation but it is uncertain if it reached amounts comparable to the PECsoil. Taking into account that no effects were observed in the long-term study at an application rate of up to 5 times the suggested field rate and that no acute effects were observed in the study with bifenox-acid no further studies with earthworms are considered necessary. No studies with bifenox and other soil non-target micro-organisms were triggered. The need for studies with bifenox-acid was discussed in the experts' meeting. It was agreed that no study is required if the long-term risk to earthworms is sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.",NA,,,,,1706
93,1799,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.146r,"Mepiquat is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on mepiquat in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 5 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 20 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in January February 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator in cereals for stem stabilisation as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Terpal"" (BAS 098 00 W), a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 305 g/1 mepiquat chloride and 155g/1 ethephon. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection productsare possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices, however some validation data are required for the residue method for milk, egg, fat and muscle. In mammalian toxicity tests, mepiquat-chloride is harmful to rats after oral exposure and is proposed for classification with R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" (LD50 464 mg/kg bw, equivalent to 270 mg/kg bw mepiquat). The dermal LD50 of mepiquat-chloride in rats is >2000 mg/kg bw; mepiquat-chloride is proposed for classification as R20, Harmful by inhalation as the LC50 in the rat for mepiquatchloride was approximately 4.89 mg/1 (equivalent to 2.84 mg/L mepiquat), the maximum attainable concentration under the experimental conditions. Mepiquat-chloride is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a sensitiser. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is an overall NOAEL of 30.5 mg/kg bw/day from 3- and 12-month study in dog that showed salivation and some mortalities, vacuolisation of the kidney and increased accumulation of siderin in the liver and spleen, whose mechanism and toxicological significance is unclear. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any genotoxic or clastogenic potential in a range of in vitro and in vivo studies. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any carcinogenic potential either in rats or mice. The relevant NOAEL in long term toxicity studies in rat is 200 mg/kg bw/day. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any reproductive or developmental toxicity potential: the relevant NOAEL for maternal, reproductive and offspring toxicity is 320 mg/kg bw/day based on reduction in viability and lactation indices, body weight and the impaired morphological development in the offspring; in the developmental toxicity study in rats the NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 150 mg/kg bw/day based on clinical signs of toxicity and impaired body weight gain at 300 mg/kg bw/day and for foetotoxicity and teratogenicity 300 mg/kg bw/day based on the absence of any other signs of toxicity at the highest test dose in the study. In a developmental neurotoxicity study, administration of mepiquat resulted in acute lethality for gavaged pups. The ADI is 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 19.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 12-month dietary study in dogs; the AOEL is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 30.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in dogs; the ARfD of 0.3 mg/kg bw for mepiquat-chloride is based on the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day obtained in the developmental neurotoxicity study. The applied SF is 100. Estimated operator exposure with the German model indicate for operators not wearing PPE levels below the AOEL (10 %) as well as for the UK POEM (70% of the AOEL). Predicted bystander exposure is <1% of the short term systemic AOEL. Workers would not be expected to re-enter treated crops after spraying to perform crop inspection tasks until spray deposits are dry. Estimates of exposure to mepiquat-chloride using data for re-entry exposure contained in the EUROPOEM database indicate exposure levels below the AOEL (3.5%). The metabolism of mepiquat chloride was investigated in wheat, barley, cotton and grapes. The major component in the crops at harvest was unmetabolised mepiquat. Though rotational crops data were not triggered by the residue behaviour of mepiquat chloride in soil, a metabolism study in rotational crops with radio-labelled substance was submitted. The data indicate that in practice residues above the limit of quantification of the analytical method are not expected to occur in succeeding and rotational crops. Currently, only the use of mepiquat chloride on barley would be supported by a sufficient number of valid residue trial data while the notified representative use is on cereals in general. Therefore a data gap for further residue trials was identified. Animal metabolism studies with ruminants and poultry are available to establish the nature of residues in food of animal origin. Since insufficient data is available to assess the magnitude of residues in cereal grain and straw, the livestock exposure assessment cannot be finalised. Moreover, the residue analysed in the livestock feeding studies does not correspond to the proposed animal residue definition for risk assessment, and further data and information is needed to establish reliable transfer factors of residues in food of animal origin and conversion factors for monitoring. Therefore the meeting of experts concluded that the consumer risk assessment and MRL proposals cannot be finalised. If deviating from the notified use on cereals a use of mepiquat-chloride on barley only is considered, consumer exposure is expected to be well below the toxicological reference values for mepiquat-chloride and MRLs could be proposed. With regard to the environmental fate and behaviour data no significant metabolites (>10% AR) were identified in any soil at any time point in laboratory aerobic route and rate of degradation studies using [2,6-14C] mepiquat-chloride. First order DT50 values were in the range 6 to 40 d. In laboratory anaerobic metabolism studies and soil photodegradation studies mepiquat-chloride was observed to undergo insignificant degradation, and no DT50 values could be calculated. Based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies mepiquat chloride can be classified as slight to high mobile in soil (Kfoc = 67-4833 mL/g, with a median value of 890 mL/g). For groundwater, the 80th percentile annual average concentrations in leachate leaving the top 1 m soil layer were predicted to be <0.001 g/L for mepiquat-chloride for all FOCUS scenarios pertinent to use on winter cereals. In aerobic natural water/sediment systems, mepiquat-chloride dissipated from the water phase by partitioning to sediment with a first order DT50 of 6 to 9 d. Peak partitioning of mepiquat-chloride to the sediment was measured 14 to 30 d after dosing at a maximum of 56.2% AR. Mineralisation was significant and by the termination of the study (CO2)-C-14 represented 61.7-65.8% AR. No significant quantities of metabolites were detected. First order DT50 values for the whole system were 32 to 33 d. Mepiquat-chloride is essentially non-volatile and there is little potential for volatilisation from either soil or plant surfaces. Consequently, air is not a likely route of environmental contamination. Birds and mammals may be exposed to mepiquat-chloride by intake of insects present in the treated crop. Since mepiquat-chloride is to be applied after BBCH growth stage 31 the crop itself is assumed to be past the stage were it is attractive as food. The acute and short-term TER values for birds are well above the Annex VI triggers in the first tier assessment, hence indicating a low risk. For mammals, both the acute and long-term TER values are well above the triggers, hence the risk to mammals is considered as low. The first -tier long-term TER value for birds is 4.4 and thus below the Annex VI trigger of 5. A new long-term (reproduction) study with birds was presented in an addendum (June 2007) together with a new risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) as a focal species. The refinement of PT and PD were accepted by the experts and the refined long-term TER of 8.53 was above the trigger of 5. The risk to birds from the second active substance (ethephon) in the representative formulation ""Terpal"" was considered in the acute risk assessment presented in the addendum. The acute TERs were still above the trigger and the acute risk from the formulation was considered as sufficiently addressed. A risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water according to SANCO/ 4145/2000 was included in the addendum. The acute TERs of >7.3 (birds) and 2.2 (mammals) were below the trigger of 10. No agreement was reached in the expert meeting on the relevance of this exposure route for the suggested use in cereals. It was proposed by the experts that this point should be left open to be considered at MS level after Annex I inclusion since the relevance of this exposure scenario may depend on the local weather conditions and the landscape structure (availability of alternative drinking water sources). The most sensitive aquatic organism tested and driving the aquatic risk assessment was Lemna gibba. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 with FOCUS step 1 PECs,, indicating a low risk. Mepiquatchloride partitions into sediment, and was found in amounts of 48-56% of applied in the water/sediment studies. However, since the NOEC for Daphnia is 12.5 mg/L, which is >0.1 mg/L, a study with sediment dwelling organisms is not required according to SANCO/3268/2001. The log P. for mepiquat-chloride is <3 and therefore the potential for bioconcentration is considered as low. No major metabolites (>10%) were detected in the water/sediment study The risk to bees, other non -target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA,,,,,1706
94,1800,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,NA,"Imidacloprid is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on imidacloprid in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 25 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in March-May 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in April 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide seed treatment for sugar beet and as a foliar spray for apples and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP are in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Confidor"", a soluble concentrate formulation (SL) and ""Gaucho"" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS). Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However it should be noted that the residue definition in plants and surface water for monitoring purposes has not been finalised. In addition to this as the peer review process found that the active substance should be classified as toxic a data gap for a method of analysis for body fluids was identified. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. A method of analysis is available for the active substance in the FS formulation but not in the SL. Within the toxicological assessment, imidacloprid is almost completely absorbed by oral administration, does not bioaccumulate and is excreted mainly by the urine. Showing a high acute oral toxicity in mice but a low toxicity after dermal or inhalative exposure, imidacloprid was not irritant to the skin or the eye and had no skin sensitisation potential. The proposed classification for the acute toxicity was T, R25 Toxic if swallowed. In short term studies with rats and mice, the most sensitive parameter was the decreased body weight development. In the dog studies, indications of an effect on the central nervous system were observed (clinical signs). No evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic effects was observed with imidacloprid. Likewise it did not affect the reproductive parameters in rats, or the embryofoetal development in rats and rabbits. In neurotoxicity studies, effects occurred in the functional observational battery, without histopathological findings in the nervous tissues. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the chronic rat study, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.08 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study supported by the subchronic rat neurotoxicity study, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.08 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study. All reference values were derived with a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption values for Confidor SL 200 were 0.3% for the concentrate and 8% for the dilution, whereas the default value of 100% was adopted for Gaucho FS 600 in the absence of experimental data. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL for Confidor SL 200 without the use of personal protective equipment whereas it is above the AOEL for Gaucho FS 600 with the use of coveralls and gloves. Similarly the exposure estimates for workers re-entering crops treated with Confidor SL 200 are lower than the AOEL, whereas the estimates for workers loading and sowing seeds treated with Gaucho FS 600 are higher than the AOEL. And finally, the bystander exposure to both formulations is not expected to exceed 6% of the AOEL. The plant metabolism of imidacloprid has been clearly elucidated after foliar, seed and soil treatments. Considering all information available, the residue definition for risk assessment is proposed to include the active substance and all metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridinyl moiety. A residue definition for monitoring was not agreed under the peer review process. The EFSA is however of the opinion that 2 options are possible (either parent compound or the same residue definition as for risk assessment). A sufficient amount of field supervised residue trials is available in support of all representative uses. These data allow assessing acute and chronic consumer exposure. They also provide appropriate information for setting MRLs in accordance with the 2 options proposed for the residue definition. No significant transfer of soil residues to rotational crops is expected under practical conditions. No change in the nature of residues is expected under processing. Livestock may be exposed to residues of imidacloprid and its metabolites, but the metabolism and feeding studies demonstrate that the transfer of residues to animal commodities is limited and below the limit of quantification of analytical methods. No risk for the consumer has been identified under acute or chronic exposure to residues resulting from the representative uses of imidacloprid. This conclusion needs however to be consolidated by further information first confirming that the metabolism of the compound in plants does not lead to compounds of particular toxicological concern. In soil under aerobic conditions imidacloprid exhibits moderate to very high persistence. Mineralisation of the pyridinyl-C-14-methylene radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.3-17% AR after 91-100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 17-27 % AR after 91-100 days. No metabolite accounted for > 3.4% AR at any sampling time. The soil accumulation assessment for imidacloprid residues under conditions represented by 2 UK soil accumulations studies was not finalised. Under anaerobic soil conditions the metabolite M09(2) was a major metabolite accounting for a maximum of 51% AR after 249 days of anaerobic conditions. Imidacloprid exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. M09 would be expected to exhibit low mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of imidacloprid was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems imidacloprid exhibited moderate to high persistence. No metabolite accounted > 6.3% AR at any sampling time. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 2.5 % AR at 92 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 66 % AR at study end in the system with 4.09% organic carbon (oc). In the lower oc content system (0.89%) unextracted residues accounted for a lower proportion at 15% AR at study end. Photolysis mediates the degradation of imidacloprid in aquatic systems to 4 major identified degradation products with imidacloprid exhibiting low to moderate persistence in a German outdoor mesocosm study (summer application). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments are available using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for imidacloprid at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift and runoff mitigation being applied at step 4. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by imidacloprid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Evidence from the available guideline lysimeter studies indicated that contamination of groundwater by imidacloprid or its minor soil metabolites is unlikely from the applied for intended uses assessed in this conclusion. The representative uses are spray application in apples (northern Europe and southern Europe) and tomatoes (southern Europe) indoors and outdoors and seed treatment of sugar beet. The risk assessment for birds and mammals was conducted for uptake of contaminated food items for the outdoor uses only. No exposure of birds and mammals was assumed for the glasshouse use. The acute, short-term and long-term endpoints used in the risk assessment for birds were discussed in the meeting of experts and the values which were proposed by the RMS in the DAR were confirmed in the meeting of experts. The first-tier TERs the uptake of sugar beet seed pellets as a food item and as grit were significantly below the Annex VI trigger values. The suggested refinements based on the low attractivity as food items and the low availability of sugar beet seed pellets (provided a high drilling efficiency leaving only 0.17% of the seed pellets on the soil surface and seed pelletages are removed from the soil surface) was accepted and the risk to birds was considered as low. However the suggested refinements of the risk assessment for granivorous mammals were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected by the experts. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the risk to granivorous mammals. The risk to medium herbivorous mammals from uptake of residues in sugar beet seedlings was assessed as low but the risk assessment for birds for the uptake of residues in sugar beet seedlings needed refinement. Wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) was accepted as a focal species. As a refinement step it was proposed that wood pigeons feed in bouts and one filling of the crop with sugar beet seedlings would constitute 20% of the daily food intake. This was used as a crop-filling factor of 0.2 in the exposure calculation. However it was noted by the experts that the birds may feed several times in one day on the same field and considerations of metabolic processes was missing. An open point was identified by the experts for the RMS to include information on the toxicokinetics to support the risk refinement. The RMS noted in addendum 6 (not peer-reviewed) that the available studies on the metabolic processes cannot be used to support the suggested use of the crop limiting factor of 0.2. The RMS proposed using the crop-limiting factor of 0.2 also for the short-term and long-term risk assessment. This was not accepted and it was proposed that real PD data would be a more appropriate refinement step for the short-term and long-term risk assessment. The suggested PT value of 0.1 was rejected by the experts because it was not sufficiently justified by data. The experts concluded that a high risk to birds from uptake of sugarbeet seedlings cannot be excluded for the representative use. The first-tier TER values were below the triggers for insectivorous birds for the uses in tomatoes and orchards. The applicant suggested a PT of 0.61 for blue tit (Parus caeruleus) in orchards and 0.1 for yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) in tomato. An insect residue study was submitted and discussed in the expert meeting. The results of the study were considered as not reliable by the experts. The PD refinements (relative proportion of small and large insects) were accepted by the experts. The suggested PT value for yellow wagtail was not supported by data and hence rejected by the experts as well as the PT to refine the acute risk of blue tit. The TERs based on accepted refinements indicate a low risk to insectivorous birds for the use in tomato but the acute TER for blue tits is below the trigger of 10 requiring further risk refinements for the use in orchards. The first-tier acute and long-term TERs for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger values of 10 and 5. The risk to herbivorous mammals from spray application in tomatoes was considered as low since tomatoes are not attractive as a food source. The risk assessment for herbivorous mammals in orchards resulted in TERs above the trigger taking interception factors into account and also residue decline to refine the long-term risk assessment. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from uptake of plant metabolites is considered as covered by the risk assessment for imidacloprid. The lowest endpoints from the tested aquatic organisms were observed for Chironomus riparius. The spray formulation Confidor SL 200 was tested with Chironomus riparius. The toxicity of formulated imidacloprid was similar to technical imidacloprid. Testing with the granular formulation Gaucho FS 600 Uncoloured was considered as not necessary since aquatic organisms are expected to be exposed to the active substance but not to the formulation. The TER values based on maximum PECsw of the worst case FOCUSsw scenario R3 were well above the Annex VI triggers for fish, daphnids and algae. The acute and chronic TER for Chironomus riparius were below the Annex VI trigger of 10. The experts agreed that the endpoints from the mesocosm of 0.6 jug imidacloprid/L should be used in the risk assessment. No agreement was reached on the safety factor which should be applied. It was proposed that MSs use a safety factor of 1-3 in combination with the NOEC of 0.6 itg imidacloprid/L. The TER values based on the endpoint of 0.6 jug imidacloprid/L and FOCUS step3 PECsw were in the range of 0.09 and 1 indicating a high risk to aquatic insects for the uses in tomatoes and apples. The TERs for the use as a seed treatment were >3 suggesting a low risk. With no-spray buffer zones of 20 m a TER of >1 is achieved in the full FOCUS step4 drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D5) and in the run-off scenarios R1, R2, R3 (without additional run-off mitigation) and R4 (including 50% run-off mitigation) for the use in orchards. A TER of >3 was reached in none of the full FOCUS step4 scenarios. The drainage scenario D6 resulted in a TER of >1 with spray drift reduction by 95% (equivalent to 35-40 m no-spray buffer zone) but no full run-off scenario resulted in a TER >1 for the use in tomatoes. If run-off is mitigated by 90% then the TERs were >1. However none of the scenarios except R3 resulted in TERs >3. The metabolites MO 1, M07, were about 1 order of magnitude acutely less toxic and the metabolites M09, M12, M16 and M23 were more than 2 orders of magnitude less chronically toxic to Chironomus riparius than imidacloprid. The TER values based PECsw values from FOCUSsw scenario R3 (which resulted in highest PECsw values for imidacloprid) were above the trigger of 100 except for metabolite M07 where a TER of 46 was observed. It is concluded that the risk from metabolites is low for all representative uses and that the risk from metabolite M07 is covered by the risk mitigation required for imidacloprid. No toxicity data were made available for the photolysis metabolite M14. The risk from this metabolite to aquatic organisms needs to be addressed. The risk of bioaccumulation from imidacloprid and its metabolites which are predicted to reach surface water is considered as low. Imidacloprid is acutely very toxic to bees. In addition to the standard acute toxicity tests also chronic tests and studies to investigate sublethal effects (bee behaviour) were conducted. The HQ values for oral and contact exposure were far in excess of the HQ trigger value of 50 indicating a high risk to bees from the use as a spray application in orchards and tomatoes. Imidacloprid has a distinct systemic mode of action. Therefore the uptake in plants from soil/seed treatment applications was investigated in different crops. Imidacloprid is preferentially translocated to leaves and shoots and to a much lower extend to the reproductive organs. No major soil metabolites were detected in the soil degradation studies. Bees would therefore only be exposed to imidacloprid residues in succeeding crops. The RMS presented a TER calculation based on NOEC values (acute and chronic lethal effects, behavioural impacts including bee hive development) and residue levels in nectar and/or pollen of <5 ppb resulting in TER values of >9.2, >10, >4.8 and >4 indicating a low risk to bees from the representative use as a seed treatment. Furthermore sugar beet is harvested before flowering hence the risk to bees is expected to be low from the use as a seed treatment in sugar beet. The risk from exposure to honeydew excreted from aphids was considered as low based on the argumentation that the acute oral LD50 for aphids is several orders of magnitude lower than for bees and hence it would be highly unlikely that aphids would survive exposure to imidacloprid at concentrations in sap which could lead to the excretion of honeydew which is toxic to bees. The line of argumentation was agreed by the experts but it was not clear how the toxicity value for aphids was derived and the experts suggested a data gap for the applicant to clarify this point. Overall it is concluded that the spray applications of imidacloprid pose a high risk to bees. Risk mitigation is required for the use in orchards. The risk to bees is considered to be low if the product is not applied during flowering and if flowering weeds are removed/mown before the application. However it should be noted that bees potentially foraging in the off-crop area would still be exposed via spray drift and hence not be protected by the suggested risk mitigation measure. Flowering tomato plants are visited by honey-bees and other pollinators. The risk mitigation suggested for orchards is not an option for the use in tomato since the tomato plants flower almost continuously. The spray application of imidacloprid will cause severe impacts on non-target arthropods in the infield and off-field area. However in semi-field and field studies it was demonstrated that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible. The available data suggest that ageing of residues of 273 days is required in order not to be hazardous to larvae of Poecilus cupreus. A high risk to soil dwelling arthropods cannot be excluded for the seed treatment use. The available semi-field test with P. cupreus was conducted at too low concentrations of imidacloprid to allow a conclusion on the risk from the representative use in sugar-beet. The first tier risk assessment for earthworms resulted in TERs below the trigger. Field studies were submitted. However it was not clear whether the application pattern in the field studies were the same as suggested in the GAP and whether the plateau PECsoil is covered. An open point was set in the meeting for the RMS to check whether the exposure in the field studies were in accordance to the GAP. The RMS confirmed that the application patterns were different from the representative uses but suggest that the application rates of 133 g a.s./ha (seed treatment) and 150 g a.s./ha (spray application) would cover the representative uses. However the estimated PECsoil in the field studies (0.1773 mg a.s./kg and 0.2 mg a.s./kg) are below the accumulated maximum PECs. Therefore uncertainty remains with regard to the long-term risk to earthworms. This uncertainty needs to be addressed further. Organic matter breakdown was not affected in litterbag studies with the spray formulation Imidacloprid SL 200 and the seed treatment formulation Gaucho FS 600. However the maximum PECsoil values calculated are about 2-3 times higher than the concentrations in the litterbag studies. Therefore it cannot be concluded that the risk to organic matter breakdown is addressed. No adverse effects were observed in a test with technical imidacloprid and the predatory mite Hypoaspis aculeifer at the highest tested application rate of 120 g a.s./ha. The NOEC observed for technical imidacloprid and Folsomia candida was 1.25 mg a.s./kg soil The endpoint observed for the formulations were lower compared to technical imidacloprid and the TERs for the formulations are below the trigger of 5 if the NOECs are compared to the accumulated maximum PECsoil concentrations indicating a potential high risk to soil dwelling arthropods. The risk from the metabolites M06 and M07 was assessed as low. The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA,,,,,1706
95,1801,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.144r,"Fenpropimorph is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropimorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 17 March 2005. The peer review was initiated on 11 July 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in July September 2006. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January and March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to cereals, sugar beet and sunflower against several agriculturally important phytopathogens. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Corbel"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 750 g/L fenpropimorph. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices. With regard to the rat metabolism during the toxicological studies, fenpropimorph is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, largely distributed, extensively metabolised and without bioaccumulation in the body. In the acute toxicity studies, the compound was shown to be harmful if swallowed (R22) and irritating to the skin (R38). In the short term studies, the liver was the target organ and the body weight was decreased in all species. A battery of tests for mutagenicity did not demonstrate a genotoxic potential in vivo, and long term studies in rats and mice didn't show carcinogenic effects. No effects on the reproductive parameters were observed in a multigeneration study in rats, but teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits led to the proposed classification Repro Cat.3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. In specific neurotoxicity studies, adverse effects were only observed in the functional observational battery. Changes in serum acetyl cholinesterase activity were not considered as relevant adverse effects. In mechanistic studies, fenpropimorph was shown to induce hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and to inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis. The agreed ADI (acceptable daily intake) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the agreed AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) 0.007 mg/kg bw/day and the agreed ARID (acute reference dose) 0.03 mg/kg bw. The agreed dermal absorption value was 10%, and the operator exposure assessment is below the AOEL only within the German model with the use of PPE (personal protective equipment). The plant metabolism of fenpropimorph has been elucidated and appropriate residue definitions can be proposed for monitoring and risk assessment. All representative uses are not supported by appropriate residue data and further data should be submitted. No residues are expected in rotational crops under practical conditions above analytical limit of quantification. Fenpropimorph residues are not altered under processing conditions. A transfer of residues to livestock consuming treated feedstuffs may result in measurable residue levels in animal commodities. MRLs are proposed for plant and animal commodities. The resulting consumer exposure has been assessed and found to be below the toxicological reference values. However it should be noted that there is uncertainty related to the isomer ratio the consumer is actually exposed to. If MRLs need to be raised as a consequence of the results of the required residue trials, the consumer risk assessment should be reconsidered. In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropimorph exhibits low to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolites fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2)(2) (accounting for up to 9.7% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and BF-421-7' (accounting for up to 9.8%AR) which also exhibited low persistence in the single soil where peer reviewed information was available. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and morpholine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 33 and 46 % AR respectively after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 65 and 50 % AR respectively after 91 days. Fenpropimorph is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) exhibits very high to high mobility in soil. A data gap was identified for information on the soil mobility of BF 421-7. There was no indication that adsorption of fenpropimorph was pH dependent. The adsorption of fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is pH dependent, with adsorption decreasing as soil pH increases. The assessment of soil accumulation potential under conditions represented by one of the German field trial sites has not been finalised. In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropimorph partitioned relatively rapidly to sediment, where it exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) which partitioned back to the water accounting for up to 22% AR in water. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 6.3-8.5 % AR (mean of the phenyl and morpholine ring radiolabels) at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 20-37 % AR (mean of both radiolabels) at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropimorph at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation factors being appropriately applied at step 4. Volatilisation short range transport and redeposition of fenpropimorph to surface water using the results of field and wind tunnel experiments were included in the step 4 calculations, due to the potential for volatilisation of fenpropimorph which has a relatively high vapour pressure compared to many active substances. For the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2), appropriate FOCUS step 1 calculations were agreed. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropimorph and fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the soil metabolite BF-421-7, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. It was concluded that fenpropimorph is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 2.9 hours). The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for the representative uses in cereals, sugar beet and sunflower. The long term TER values for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment was discussed in the expert meeting. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4. The long-term trigger of 5 was exceeded for the uses in cereals and sugar beet. The risk assessment presented deviated for skylark from the recommendations in the experts meeting. It was assumed that skylark feeds only on large insects (RUD of 5.1 instead of 29 for small insects) based on data from a PhD theses. This refinement step was not peer-reviewed and without this refinement the TER for skylark would be below the trigger of 5. However it is likely that a certain percentage of the insect prey consist of large insects. The long-term endpoint is based on a NOEC where no effects were observed at the highest tested dose. Therefore it may be possible to agree in a weight of evidence approach that the long-term risk to skylark can be regarded as sufficiently addressed. No accepted risk refinement is available for the use in sunflower. The refined long-term risk assessment for the uses in sugar beet and sunflower based on hare (medium herbivorous mammal) resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5 and were accepted by the experts. The vole (Microtus arvalis) was rejected as a focal species for the use in cereals. The risk assessment provided in addendum 4 (not peer-reviewed) was conducted according to the recommendations of the expert meeting (wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus as a focal species and refinement of PD). The resulting TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low risk. The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish was assessed as low. Potential endocrine disrupting properties of fenpropimorph were discussed in the meeting. On the basis of the available information it was agreed that endocrine disrupting effects due to aromatase inhibition are unlikely to occur. Overall it is concluded that the risk to birds and mammals is expected to be low for the uses evaluated except for the use in sunflower where the long-term risk to birds needs further refinement. The long-term toxicity to fish was driving the aquatic risk assessment. In the expert meeting it was agreed to use the NOEC of 1.95 lag a.s./L from an early life stage study (ELS) conducted under a realistic exposure situation. The endpoint (NOEC) of 1.95 g a.s./L was suggested to be used in the risk assessment in combination with the maximum peak PECsw value. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4 from February 2008. The TER calculation presented in the addendum combined no-spray buffer zones with drift reduction nozzles and run-off mitigation to achieve TERs above the trigger of 10. No spray buffer zones of >20 metres alone are not sufficient to achieve a full FOCUS step4 scenario with TERs >10. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be refined further. The major metabolite in the water-sediment system fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is of low acute toxicity to fish, daphnids and algae. The risk from BF 4212 to aquatic organisms is considered as low. A short-term impact on sensitive arthropod species is likely to occur in the in-field area after application of fenpropimorph. However given the rapid residue decline in plants it is likely that the treated area is recolonised within a short period of time from unaffected off-crop areas. Therefore it was agreed by the experts that the risk to non-target arthropods is low for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. However, the first-tier long-term (reproduction) TERs were <5. A field study with earthworms was made available by the applicant. No effects were observed on abundance and total biomass of earthworms. The observation period in the study was too short to detect potential effects on the reproduction of those earthworm species with long reproductive cycles. However the study gives an indication that the long term risk to earthworms is low. The experts agreed to the assessment of the RMS and considered the risk to earthworms as sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. However as the soil exposure assessment is not finalised (as the accumulation potential in soil is not finalised), the risk assessment to earthworms cannot be finalised. Statistical significant effects of 7.4 % to 19.3 % were observed in the litterbag study. The experts considered the effects as relevant and the study was too short to exclude adverse effects on organic matter breakdown. The experts considered a new study in accordance with the latest guidance as necessary. The risk to bees, soil micro-organisms (subject to finalisation of the soil exposure assessment), non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA,,,,,1706
96,1802,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,NA,"Abamectin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on abamectin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 27 October 2005. The peer review was initiated on 1 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main applicant Syngenta. Probelte also submitted a dossier which was found to be substantially incomplete. A third notifier, Sinon EU Cooperation did not provide a dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in July - August 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November - December 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in April May 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide on citrus, lettuce and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Vertimec 018 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the technical material can not be concluded on as the batch data were not acceptable and a data gap has been identified. The purity of all the starting material used in the manufacturing process has not been provided and this is also now a data gap. The strain of the micro organism used in production has not been provided. The purity of the material used in the spectra study is also identified as a data gap. With regard to its toxicological properties, abamectin is almost completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the rat, widely distributed throughout tissues and organs, and rapidly eliminated from the body. Abamectin is very toxic by inhalation and if swallowed (T+, R26/28). Short term studies in dogs, the most sensitive species, showed a very steep dose response for clinical signs of neurotoxicity and mortality, however without histopathological correlates in the nervous tissues. Therefore the classification with '1'; R48/25 Toxic, Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed' was proposed for abamectin. With regard to genotoxicity and long term toxicity, abamectin had no mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. In the reproductive toxicity studies, there were no strong effects on the reproductive parameters triggering classification, and the findings in neonatal rats were attributed to a higher sensitivity related to a limited expression of Pglycoprotein, not relevant to humans. Nevertheless, the teratogenic observations in rats and rabbits led to the proposed classification 'Repro. Cat.3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child'. With regard to specific neurotoxic effects, only clinical signs were observed in the acute and semi-chronic neurotoxicity studies. Several studies were performed with the [8,9-Z]-isomer of avermectin Bia (acute oral toxicity, Ames test, one-generation study, developmental studies) and showed the same toxicological profile as abamectin. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) are 0.0025 mg/kg bw/day based on the short term dog studies, whereas the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.005 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study. All were derived with a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value was 1% for both the concentrate and the dilution. Different scenarios were considered in the operator exposure assessment, and the use of personal protective equipment was needed only during treatment of tomatoes in greenhouse, in order to have an exposure estimate below the AOEL. The metabolism of abamectin in plants has been elucidated and essentially results from photolysis. The major degradation product is the [8,9-Z]-isomer. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities should include avermectin Bia, its [8,9-Z]-isomer and avermectin Bib which may account for up to 20 % of technical abamectin. Further degradations products of moderate polarity do not need to be included in the definition as their contribution to the toxicological burden is not expected to be significant. Supervised residue trials were conducted and form a sufficient basis for setting MRLs and for assessing consumer exposure. Nevertheless some deficiencies were identified on lettuce grown outdoor and for lettuce and tomatoes grown indoor in winter season. Indications are present that under conditions of low photolysis residues may be much higher and it is recommended not to use abamectin in glasshouse from November to February. This restriction could be cancelled on the basis of appropriate residue trials conducted in winter conditions allowing a robust consumer exposure assessment to be made. Limited information is available on the effect of processing on abamectin residues. Standard hydrolysis studies in buffer solution show a limited degradation of the compound but the resulting degradation products are considered of the same level of toxicity as the parent compound. Therefore no reducing factor related to processing should be used in risk assessment involving processed commodities. Residues in rotational crops are not expected. The potential critical exposure of livestock to abamectin residues was determined by the RMS on theoretical grounds. This exposure may result in residues in animal commodities in the range of the limit of quantification of avermectin Bia of the validated method of analysis used for enforcement. Nevertheless the setting of residue definitions and MRLs in animal commodities was considered not needed as these would be covered by the legal provisions already in force as a result of the use of abamectin as veterinary drug. The short and long term consumer exposure assessments showed that acute and chronic intakes of residues resulting from the representative uses are below respective toxicological reference values. These assessments do not consider the winter use of abamectin in glasshouse. It was accepted that the environmental fate and behaviour of the avermectin Bia component of abamectin would be expected to be representative for the environmental behaviour of the avermectin Bib component. In soil under aerobic conditions avermectin Bia exhibits very low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites: 8a-oxo-avermectin Bia, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bia and 4,8a-dihydroxy-avermectin Bia which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and 8a-oxo-4hydroxy-avermectin Bia which exhibited medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of both the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel and 3,7,11,13,23-C-14-radiolabels to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 3.2-12.4% AR after 90-147 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 24-39 % of the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel after 90-91 days. Avermectin Bia is immobile or exhibits low mobility in soil with the 4 metabolites indicated above also exhibiting low mobility or being immobile in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compounds was pH dependant. There was an unidentified soil metabolite ascribed as U8 present in soil that triggers a groundwater exposure assessment. However such an assessment is not available. There was no satisfactory evidence presented that enabled the potential soil mobility of U8 to be characterised. In dark natural sediment water systems avermectin Bia partitioned to sediment where it degraded exhibiting medium persistence with the minor metabolite 4""-oxo-avermectin Bia in sediment (max. 8.6%AR) representing the greatest proportion of AR of the 4 metabolites identified. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 0.1-3 % of the applied 23-C-14-radiolabel at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a major sink representing 20-23 % of this radiolabel at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for abamectin at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the soil metabolites 8aoxo-avermectin Bla, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bla, 4, 8a-dihy droxy-avermectin B la, 4-hydroxy-8a-oxoavermectin Bia that may runoff or drain to surface water appropriate FOCUS surface water step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Under sterile laboratory aqueous photolysis conditions the metabolite [8,9-Z]-isomer of avermectin Bia was formed at a maximum of 8.2%AR. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by avermectin Bia, 8a-oxo-avermectin Bia, 8a-hydroxy-avermectin Bia, 4,8a-dihy droxy-avermectin Bla and 4-hydroxy-8a-oxo-avermectin Bla above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 lag/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for all uses. However, the long term risk to birds was assessed as high for the uses in lettuce and tomatoes and a refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds is needed. In citrus orchards the long-term risk to birds is acceptable after refinement (initial insect residues). The risk to fish-eating and earthworm-eating birds is low. The acute risk to mammals is considered to be low. However a long term risk to mammals cannot be excluded. For the uses in citrus orchards and lettuce a refined risk assessment is needed. The risk to fish-eating and earthworm-eating mammals is low. Abamectin is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to invertebrates and fish. To refine the first tier high risk to invertebrates two outdoor microcosm studies were submitted. In one study a renewal of the test medium was allowed (renewal within 5.9 d) and in the other study a conventional static system was used.. It was concluded by the PRAPeR meeting that the NOEC from the renewal study (0.2 lag a.s./L) can be used for risk assessment of ditches and streams. A safety factor of 2 should be used because not all species groups were included in the study. The NOEAEC of 0.049 lig a.s./L from the study with a conventional static system together with a safety factor of 3 was agreed upon and should be used for ponds and the glasshouse applications. Based on the endpoints from the outdoor microcosm studies it can be concluded that a safe use with respect to aquatic invertebrates is demonstrated only for the use in lettuce in the field (pond scenario) and the use in lettuce and tomatoes in glasshouses (ditch). For all the other uses and scenarios the risk is not acceptable without sufficient risk mitigation measures (for example no-spray bufferzones varying from 14 (stream scenario) 18 m (ditch scenario) for applications in citrus and 2 m for the applications in tomatoes and lettuce). The relevant regulatory endpoint for the acute risk assessment for fish was the mean HC5 based on LC50-values (= 3.08 lag a.s./L) with a safety factor of 10 = 0.31 lig a.s./L. Based on this value the use in citrus needs a bufferzone of minimal 10 m. For the other uses no additional bufferzones are necessary. For the chronic risk assessment to fish an HC5 of 0.22 lig a.s./L was agreed upon. Based on this value the use in citrus needs a buffer zone of minimal 12 m for the use in orchards. For the other uses no additional buffer zones are necessary. The risk of the soil metabolites and the aquatic photolysis metabolite to aquatic organisms has not been addressed in a sufficient way by the applicant and should be addressed further. Also the risk of the sediment metabolite 4""-oxo-avermectin Bia to sediment dwelling organisms should be addressed. The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk of abamectin to bees was assessed as high. The following labelling is suggested: ""Dangerous to bees. To protect bees and other pollinating insects do not apply to crop plants when in flower. Do not use where bees are actively foraging. Do not apply when flowering weeds are present."" For the use in tomatoes in glasshouses a minimum waiting period of at least 96 h should be applied before bees/bumblebees are used as pollinators in the glasshouse. Abamectin is very toxic to non-target arthropods. It was concluded in the PRAPeR Meeting that no acceptable off-field risk has been shown. Aged residue tests are not accepted to conclude about non flying insects off-field. Buffer zones in-field are required for acceptable off-field risk. Based on the results of the extended laboratory tests with Typhlodromus pyri it was concluded that for the use in citrus a buffer zone of minimal 15 m is needed to get an acceptable off-field risk. For the field uses in lettuce and tomatoes this buffer zone should be 5 m. For earthworms the acute and long-term TERs for abamectin were above the relevant trigger values of 10 and 5 indicating a low risk to earthworms. The risk from the soil metabolites to earthworms is low as well. For soil micro-organisms it is concluded that the risk from the active compound and soil metabolites is low for the representative uses evaluated. Since no or slight herbicidal effects were observed at in-field treatment rates the risk in the off-field area for non-target plants is considered to be low for all representative uses evaluated. It is not expected that abamectin would reach biological sewage treatment plants in relevant amounts if applied according to the GAP and therefore the risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA,,,,,1706
100,1806,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.213,"Etofenprox is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on etofenprox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005 and following a quality check on the DAR, on 14 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Landis Kane Consulting. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in oilseed rape, head cabbage, grapes, peach and apple for the control of biting and sucking insects. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'TREBON 30EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 287.5 g/L etofenprox. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices. In the mammalian metabolism studies, etofenprox was rapidly but partially absorbed after oral administration. It was uniformly distributed through the body, and transferred via placenta and via milk. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; etofenprox was rapidly eliminated, mainly via faeces, a major part as metabolites. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a modified maximisation test. The main target organs of etofenprox were the liver and thyroid upon short-term or long-term exposure in the rat, which was the most sensitive species. The mouse presented also renal toxicity, but at much higher dose levels and the dog was less sensitive, showing effect only in the liver. The relevant NOAEL for short-term exposure was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; for long-term exposure, the NOAELs in rat and mouse were similar. 3 1 mg/kg bw/day in mouse and 3.7 mg/kg bw/day in rat. No potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The aetiology of the formation of the thyroid adenomas observed in rats was elucidated in a mechanistic study and considered not relevant for human risk assessment. Marginally increased renal cortical tumours found only in male mice at high doses were also not considered relevant to humans. No effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was found, however, considering the increased mortality of offsprings during the lactation phase, classification with R64, ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"", was proposed. Further studies were provided on the plant metabolite alpha-CO2, which showed that its toxicity is covered by the parent's toxicity studies. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of etofenprox was 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term mouse study and applying a safety factor of 100, which is supported by the long-term rat study. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, applying a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 30 % for low oral absorption. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 1.0 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day from the rabbit developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100. A default value of 30 % was agreed for dermal absorption. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation ""TREBON 30EC"", at a maximum dose rate of 0.21 kg etofenprox/ha in high crops (grapes, peaches and apples) was below the AOEL when the use of gloves was considered; in field crops (oilseed rape and head cabbage), no personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed to achieve an operator exposure estimate below the AOEL, according to the German model. According to the UK POEM model, estimated operator exposure was above the AOEL, even when the use of PPE was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with etofenprox was below the AOEL, if PPE were worn (protective gloves, long-sleeved shirt and long trousers). Bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL. Concerning the plant and animal metabolism studies, the meeting of experts discussed the unusual way the experiments were conducted, using applications of a 1:1 mixture of both labelled forms in a single study, instead of two distinct radioactive labels from two separate studies. After discussion, the experts were of the opinion that such studies may only be accepted when no extensive cleavage of the parent molecule is observed. Thus, in the specific case of etofenprox, this practice could be accepted as no extensive metabolism was observed in plants and animals Otherwise, in the case of an extensive metabolism and/or early cleavage of the parent molecule, the recovered levels of the different metabolites may be underestimated, when compared to the initial radioactive level of parent molecule. In such situation, the meeting re-enforced its opinion that metabolism studies must be conducted separately according to the different labelling forms, in order to depict the fate of each labelling portion of the molecule as completely as possible and to provide reliable quantitative information. In plants, the metabolism of etofenprox has been investigated in rapeseed, grape and lettuce. The metabolism was limited and etofenprox was found to be the major compound of the residues, the other metabolites being detected in very low proportions, up to 7% of the TRR for the alpha-CO metabolite. However and considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was observed in proportions higher than 10 % of the etofenprox levels in the supervised residue trials, the meeting of experts decided to define the residue for risk assessment and monitoring as the ""sum of etofenprox and alpha-CO expressed as etofenprox"". Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on rape seed (Northern GAP) and on head cabbage, grape, peach and apple (Southern GAP). The storage stability studies demonstrated that etofenprox and alpha-CO residues were stable under freeze storage conditions for at least two years in oil and water-containing matrices. A standard hydrolytic study was identified as a data gap and additionally, one balance study and three follow-up studies were requested for red wine and for raisin. Processing transfer factors could be calculated for some rape seed, apple and peach processed commodities. For animals, the experts discussed the validity of the metabolism studies performed with the parent etofenprox only. Considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was shown to be a significant constituent of the residues in plants, the experts were of the opinion that information on the fate of this compound in the ruminant metabolism has to be requested. The parent etofenprox was found to be the major residue in all goat and hen matrices, and the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set provisionally as ""etofenprox"", awaiting the requested information on the alpha-CO metabolite. Based on the cow feeding study and the animal burden calculations, MRLs were proposed for milk and ruminant products. The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments were performed using the EFSA and the UK PSD models. Using the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, the calculated theoretical maximum daily intakes (TMDI) and international estimated short term intakes (IESTI) were shown to be below the ADI and ARfD values. Degradation of etofenprox in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C occurred through oxidation at different parts of the molecule followed by breaking down in smaller moieties (DT50 = 7 - 57.7 days). In one study, one of the metabolites, alpha-CO, was observed to exceed 5 % AR in one of the soils (DT50 = 12 - 45 days). Unextracted radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 55.8 % AR after 55 days, and mineralization (CO2) up to a maximum of 45.6 % AR after 120 days. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, etofenprox is highly persistent in soil (DT50 = 174 days). Under these conditions metabolite 4'-OH3 was identified as a major metabolite. Mineralization was negligible, and unextractable residue in soil amounted to 9.5 % AR after 121 days. Photolysis only slightly enhanced degradation of etofenprox in soil. PEC soil were calculated for etofenprox based on the soil half-life of 25 days for all representative uses. The meeting of experts agreed that these values could be used for the risk assessment. According to the results of available soil batch adsorption/desorption experiments, etofenprox may be classified as immobile in soil (Koc = 8548 - 14923 mL/g). The meeting of experts identified a data gap for an additional batch soil adsorption/desorption study, but considered it not essential to finalize the EU risk assessment. The metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH were estimated to be immobile with PCKOCWIN (EPA). Chemical hydrolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of etofenprox. The photolysis of etofenprox is relatively rapid. The major aqueous photolysis metabolites were alpha-CO (max 63.6 %) and PENA(4) (max. 14.4 %). The metabolite alpha-CO was also found to reach up to 10% of the parent's applied amount in the outdoor mesocosm study. On the basis of the available studies, etofenprox should be considered not ready biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, partition of etofenprox to the sediment occurs during the first seven days. The meeting of experts agreed on the half-lives calculated for etofenprox in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 6.5 days - 20.1 days). The metabolite 4'-OH was identified as a major metabolite in the sediment phase of both systems. The meeting of experts discussed the need to consider aqueous photolysis and photolysis metabolites for the EU risk assessment, and agreed that the risk assessment presented for the metabolite alpha-CO by the applicant could be regarded as conservative. PECSW were calculated with FOCUS SW modelling for the relevant scenarios based on the soil halflife of 25 days. Degradation in the water phase was assumed to occur with a half-life of 1000 days, and the mean whole water/sediment system half-life was applied to the sediment phase. Step 3 and Step 4 (only oilseed rape; assuming 30m spray drift buffer zone) were calculated for the representative uses. PECSW of the aqueous photolysis metabolite alpha-CO was estimated to be 63.6 % of the PECsw of the parent compound. Worst case PECsw were also estimated for the sediment metabolite 4'-OH as 21.9 % of the PECsw calculated for the parent compound. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate PECSED for the parent compound for the uses different from oilseed rape, to take into account the accumulation of etofenprox after multiple applications and the PECSED of the metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH. The necessary PECSW / SED values were provided by the rapporteur Member State in the addendum Volume 3 v3 after the meeting of experts. Neither etofenprox nor its soil metabolite alpha-CO is expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g /L for any of the representative uses and scenarios simulated. The environmental concentrations in air and transport through air of etofenrprox are considered negligible. The risk assessment indicated low risk to birds and mammals for all intended uses. Refinements of the long-term risk assessment for mammals were, however, required for the uses in head cabbage, grape, peach and apple to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low for all of the intended uses, as was the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended use in oilseed rape. Further refinements were still required to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. The acute risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddles was assessed as low for all intended uses of etofenprox. Etofenprox was not considered to biomagnify in the terrestrial food chain, and the risk from plant metabolites was assessed to be low. The risk to aquatic organisms was not addressed for any of the intended uses. The TER values for aquatic organisms, based on tier 1 effect data and FOCUS Step 3 and 4, failed to meet the Annex VI trigger value. The use of an endpoint from the available higher tier mesocosm study would require further supportive data. Member State experts suggested that single species tests on the most sensitive species from the mesocosm study should be provided to consolidate the confidence in the data from the mesocosm. The design of the single species tests should take into account the multi-application uses. Based on the additional studies, a relevant assessment factor should be reconsidered for a refined aquatic risk assessment. A fish full life cycle (FFLC) study was required by the Member State experts, which should be included in the aquatic risk assessment. The risk to sediment dwellers should be addressed for etofenprox and for the metabolites 4'-OH and alpha-CO. Also, the aquatic risk assessment for alpha-CO would have to be refined further for uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. In addition, the risk from biomagnification and potential endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms should be addressed. Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated a high risk to bees from all intended uses. Member State experts concluded that the available field studies did not address the risk to bees, and they agreed that mitigation measures were needed for pre-flowering/flowering uses in oilseed rape, grapevine and apple to avoid exposure of bees. The Tier I risk assessment indicated a high in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri for all intended uses. The off-field risk was considered to be low for A. pyri and A. rhopalosiphi for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, based on no-spray buffer zone of 1 and 5m, respectively. Higher tier risk assessment based on extended laboratory studies with A. rhopalosiphi, T pyri, Orius laevigatues and Chrysoperla carnea still indicated a high in-field risk to non-target arthropods. The potential for in-field recovery was not addressed in the draft assessment report. The higher tier off-field risk assessment indicated a low risk to non-target arthropods for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, with no-spray buffer zones of 1 and 5m, respectively. For uses in grapevine, the assessment indicated a need for a no-spray buffer zone of 10m to identify a low risk. Further refinements were required to address the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for uses in peach and apple. The risk to earthworms, non-target micro- and macro-soil organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low for all intended uses.",NA,,,,,1706
101,1807,Lisa,YES,NA,Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance malathion,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,NA,"Malathion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on malathion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Cheminova A/S. There was also another notifier (Cequisa) according to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 703/20014 but it was not possible to reach an agreement and to provide a collective dossier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 November 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 13 January 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 63) Following the Commission Decision of 6 June 2007 (2007/389/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of malathion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Cheminova A/S made a resubmission application for the inclusion of malathion in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No.33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows: the presence in the technical material of isomalathion, the genotoxicity of which cannot be excluded, the consumer exposure the long term risk to mammals and concerns were identified with regard to: the exposure of operators, workers and bystanders which cannot be concluded due to the presence of isomalathion in the technical material the acute and chronic risk for consumers, due to the insufficient information on the effects of certain toxicologically relevant metabolites the high risk to aquatic organisms, honey bees and non-target arthropods. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, The United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on malathion in the format of an Additional Report (The United Kingdom, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 11 February 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 13 February 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 17 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in June 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in all areas. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide and insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprised foliar spraying to control various harmful organisms in apples, strawberries, alfalfa and ornamentals at application rate up 1.8 kg malathion per hectare. The uses on apple and alfalfa were no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. only the use in strawberries and ornamentals at application rates of maximum 1.2 kg and 0.114 kg malathion per hectare respectively. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'CHA 3110' (` Fyfanon 440'), an oil in water emulsion (EW), registered under different trade names in some EU Member States. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions, however a data gap was identified concerning amendments to the description of the sample preparation for the method for residues in plants. In case of food of plant origin, malathion and malaoxon7 can also be determined by a multi-residue method. No method for the determination of malathion in food of animal origin is required for the representative uses of the resubmission. In the case of soil and surface water no enforcement method for the determination of malathion is needed due to the fact that the DT90 values are lower than 3 days. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The concentration of isomalathion8 in the batches of technical malathion tested in the toxicological studies is lower than in the specification (between 0.018%-0.44%, if mentioned at all, of the current specification.) The currently supported specification of malathion allows a maximum concentration of 0.2 % (w/w) isomalathion in the technical active substance and according to the FAO specification, it is 0.4 % (w/w). Based on the available studies in the toxicological data package, only the 0.03% isomalathion content can be said to be covered. As for the level of 0.2% isomalathion, an additional safety factor of 10 was added at the EPCO meeting to the ADI and the AOEL in order to be able to conclude on the risk assessment due to uncertainties in studies relevant for the setting of reference values. The level of isomalathion in the current 5-batch analysis showed a mean content of 0.0480.076%. This implied that the limit of 0.03% regarding the toxicological data package would not be feasible. Thus, the toxicological assumptions had to be based on the 0.2% limit. Furthermore, it is shown in the FAO specification that the amount of isomalathion even increases during storage both in relation to time and temperature by a factor of 2-10. Thus, the reference values had to be based on the 0.2% level. Malathion is rapidly absorbed and excreted. There is no evidence of accumulation. The highest concentration was found in the liver, followed by skin, fat, bone and gastrointestinal tract. The metabolites excreted in urine and faeces were primarily the mono (MMCA9) and dicarboxylic (MDCA10) acids of malathion. Malathion is moderately toxic by the oral route in rat (a classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Malathion is not acutely toxic via the dermal route or through inhalation; it is not irritant to skin and eyes but it is a skin sensitizer (Xi; R43 ""The cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed). The target uncertainties in the provisional risk assessment presented in this document, the margin of safety between the currently estimated consumer exposure and the allocated toxicological reference values is considered sufficiently big with respect to the notified use of malathion in strawberries. The available data demonstrate that in soil malathion degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity) metabolites malathion monocarboxylic acid (MMCA) and malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDCA). Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 50-67% AR after 92-162 days incubation at 20-22 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acidified acetonitrile: water followed by methylenene chloride and a methanol Soxhlet extraction or 1N hydrochloric acid followed by acidified acetonitrile and an acetone Soxhlet extraction were 26-41% AR after 92-120 days. In soil malathion and MMCA exhibited very low persistence and MDCA exhibited low persistence. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies malathion exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. MDCA exhibited very high to high mobility with adsorption being pH dependent with lower adsorption at higher soil pH. The adsorption of MMCA could not be measured in batch adsorption studies due to its very rapid degradation. However it is considered it will have high to very high mobility depending on soil pH, based on extrapolation of the results from MDCA. In sediment water systems malathion exhibited very low persistence breaking down to the major metabolites MMCA (which exhibited low persistence) and MDCA (which exhibited medium persistence). All the compounds remained primarily in the water phase of the test sediment water systems. Mineralization of the a carbon radiolabels in each ester moiety accounted for 58-69 % AR after 120 days at 20 degrees C. Residues not extracted from sediment by acidified acetonitrile followed by Soxhlet extraction with acetone were also a sink for radioactivity representing 25-36% AR at 120 days. Levels of extractable radioactivity in sediment were relatively low (< 15% AR) at all sampling times. MDCA was the largest proportion of this sediment extractable radioactivity but it accounted for a maximum of only 7.5% AR. For the representative use on strawberry appropriate aquatic exposure assessment in accordance with FOCUS 2001 surface water guidance is available for malathion and its metabolites MMCA and MDCA. In addition for malathion spray drift mitigation was implemented in aquatic exposure assessments in accordance with FOCUS 2007 landscape and mitigation guidance. This assessment has been demonstrated to encompass the exposure expected from the use assessed on glasshouse ornamentals, when a Dutch procedure for estimating emissions from glasshouses to surface water is followed. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the applied for representative uses (both in the original application and in the resubmission application) for malathion and its major soil metabolites MMCA and MDCA is minimal. (This may not be the case for other field uses especially if applications are possible over the late autumn and winter period. The available modelling indicated that in this situation contamination of vulnerable shallow groundwater by MDCA might be expected). Data were not available to conclude on the acute and long-term risk to insectivorous birds following application in strawberries. The risk is however considered low for all mammals and frugivorous birds. Based on the data available, malathion was considered to be very toxicto aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity to fish and toxicity to invertebrates was driving the aquatic risk assessment for use in strawberries. Based on FOCUSsw Step 4 exposure data including maximum mitigation measures the risk was considered low in three out of four scenarios. The toxicity to bees was identified as high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level. No risk mitigations measures were needed to protect other nontarget arthropods off field. The risk of malathion to earthworms, other soil macro- and microorganisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. However, a data gap was defined to address the potential risk to earthworms for the enantiomer forms of the metabolite MDCA.",NA,,,,,1706
102,1808,Lisa,YES,[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diflubenzuron,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,NA,"Diflubenzuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). Diflubenzuron was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as ` the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diflubenzuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 16 November 2005. The peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Chemtura Netherlands B. V. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in July- August 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2009. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears and mushrooms and in forestry. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points attached in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Dimilin WG 80', a water dispersible granule (WG). Residues in apples and pears can be analysed by a HPLC method. The method for mushrooms is not validated for the residue definition. The LOQ for the surface water method is not low enough and a data gap has been identified. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, data gaps have been identified for attrition, accelerated storage and shelf- life studies. The technical specification and batch data were not accepted and a data gap has been identified. There is a lack of a peer reviewed specification and assessment of the equivalence of the batches tested in all the mammalian toxicity studies compared to the representative formulation. In mammals, diflubenzuron is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal or inhalation routes; it is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer. Diflubenzuron showed a consistent profile of toxicity after repeated oral administration to mice, dogs and rats, with the dog being the most sensitive species. The primary target of toxicity was erythrocytes, with secondary effects apparent in the spleen and in the liver (consistent with haemolytic anaemia). The relevant oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) is 10 mg/kg bw/day (1- year dog study). Diflubenzuron did not show any genotoxic potential. No evidence of carcinogenic potential was found in rats and mice. The relevant NOAEL from the long term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is 6.4 mg/kg bw/day (mice study). No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats: the relevant parental NOAEL is lower than the LOAEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the relevant reproductive and offspring NOAEL was 3200 mg/kg bw/day. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, diflubenzuron did not cause malformations in the rat or rabbit. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL is 1000 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose level tested, rat and rabbits). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.1 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the 1 year dog study supported by the 91- week mouse study applying a SF of 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is not allocated as it is not necessary. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.033 mg/kg bw/day is based on the 1- year dog study with a correction for oral absorption of 33% and a SF of 100. The operator exposure is below the AOEL for the use on pome fruit, mushrooms (automatic sprayer) and in forestry (ground application) without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Operator exposure is below the AOEL for handheld application on mushrooms with the use of PPE. The operator exposure in forestry by aircraft application is inconclusive. The worker and bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL for all scenarios considered. Metabolism of diflubenzuron was investigated in apples and oranges after foliar application and in mushrooms after soil treatment. Whereas diflubenzuron only metabolised to a very small extent in fruits, metabolism in mushrooms was shown to be extensive. DFBA (2,6difluorobenzoic acid) was the main component of radioactive residues, besides low concentrations of diflubenzuron, PCA (4- chloroaniline) and CPU (4- chlorophenylurea). Therefore, different residue definitions for fruits and mushrooms were proposed. As the toxicological evaluation of the metabolites has not yet been finalised, it was decided to include all metabolites in a provisional residue definition for risk assessment for mushrooms. A sufficient number of residue trials on apples supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose MRLs for apples and pears. The available residue trials on mushrooms have not been carried out in accordance with the residue definition and no MRL was proposed for mushrooms. A data gap concerning a complete new data set has been identified. Whereas studies on the frozen storage stability showed satisfactory results for diflubenzuron and CPU, results for PCA were regarded as not conclusive. The notifier was asked to further investigate the storage stability of PCA. A data gap was identified concerning a hydrolysis study simulating pasteurisation to investigate the effect of processing on the nature of residues. Depending on the results of this study new processing studies on apples might be necessary. In the submitted studies, samples were only analysed for diflubenzuron. Metabolism studies on dairy cattle and laying hens showed a low transfer of diflubenzuron residues into tissues, milk and eggs. Metabolism was extensive. Besides diflubenzuron, the following metabolites were identified: CPU, PCA and PCAA (4- chloroacetanilide). It was decided to include diflubenzuron and CPU in the risk assessment for monitoring in animal matrices, as they were regarded as suitable indicators for diflubenzuron residues. As the toxicological evaluation of the metabolites is not yet finalised, it was decided to include all metabolites identified in a provisional residue definition for risk assessment. In the absence of sufficient information on the effect of processing on the nature and level of residues, a provisional dietary burden calculation was carried out. It was decided that on the basis of this calculation either a feeding study on ruminants was necessary or a justification that no feeding study was necessary. A provisional chronic dietary intake calculation showed that an exceedance of the ADI set by the toxicology meeting is not expected for intake of pome fruit and wild berries after applications of diflubenzuron according to the notified GAPs. Diflubenzuron may be considered as low persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions (DT50(norm) = 2.0 - 6.7 d). Upon degradation, it yields two major metabolites: DFBA (2,6difluorobenzoic acid) and CPU (4- chlorophenylurea). DFBA exhibits low persistence in soil (DT50 20 degrees C = 3.3 - 9.0 d) and CPU may be considered moderately persistent (DT50 20 degrees C = 15.2 - 30.5 d). A flooded soil study under anaerobic conditions was presented by the notifier as a surrogate for the anaerobic degradation in soil. In this study degradation is slower than under aerobic conditions. No new metabolites were found in this study. Photolysis does not contribute to the degradation of diflubenzuron in soil. Batch adsorption /desorption studies indicate that diflubenzuron is immobile to slightly mobile (K-Foc = 1983 - 6918 mL/g) and CPU is medium mobile in soil (KFoc = 209 - 291 mL/g). Due to the weak adsorption of DFBA, it was not possible to determine reliable adsorption parameters. During the peer review, it was agreed that simulations performed assuming a K-oc = 0 could be used to finalize the EU exposure assessment. Diflubenzuron is hydrolytically stable at pH 5 and 7 and hydrolyses to CPU and DFBA at pH 9. Metabolites CPU and DFBA are stable under these conditions. Due to the fact that biological degradation is faster than aqueous photolysis it is considered that photodegradation will not contribute to the dissipation of diflubenzuron in the environment. Diflubenzuron is considered not readily biodegradable. Diflubenzuron exhibited low persistence in water /sediment systems (DT50 whole system = 3.7 - 5.4 d). The major metabolites formed were DFBA (max. in water 7.3- 13.1 % AR; max. in sediment 3.7 % AR after 4 d) and CPU (max. in water 31.1 % AR after 8 d or 16 d; max. in sediment 15.9- 21.0 % AR after 16 d or 30d). Half- lives of the metabolites DFBA (DT50 whole system = 1.6 - 4.4 d) and CPU (DT50 whole system = 26.9 - 52.5 d) were calculated in the available study. PEC SW/SED were calculated based on the uses of 'Dimilin WG 80' on pome fruit and in forestry. For forestry (aerial and hand application) the RMS provided calculations of PECSW for parent and metabolites based only on the spray drift route of entry to surface waters assuming a drift of 33.2 % for aerial application and of 8.02% for hand application (vines application at > 50 cm is assumed to have the same drift as a hand application). The meeting of experts agreed with the PECSW for aerial application in forestry calculated by the RMS and presented in the addendum (December 2008). It was noted that PECSED were not calculated. The meeting of experts agreed that EFSA will highlight in the conclusion that when addressing the risk for aquatic insects, exposure via sediment needs to be addressed. In a late stage clarification on the GAP, the notifier indicated that a hand-held sprayer could also be used in orchards and a tractor-mounted sprayer could be used in forests. These application practices have not been evaluated for the environment and a data gap was identified by the meeting of experts for these PECSW/SED. Potential contamination of groundwater by diflubenzuron and its soil metabolites has been assessed with FOCUS PELMO v. 3.3.2. The 80th percentile at 1m depth for each of the compounds was below 0.002 mu g/L for all the nine scenarios simulated. A data gap is identified since at least two different models need to be used. However, in this case, it may be concluded that contamination of ground water will not occur when the product is used according the proposed representative uses. Member States may require a calculation with a second model for confirmatory purposes. New FOCUS GW (FOCUS PELMO v. 3.3.2 and FOCUS PEARL v. 3.3.3) modelling using a Koc = 0 for metabolite DFBA was requested during the peer review. The meeting of experts accepted the results of this modelling exercise, which indicates that the ground water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was respected for the nine scenarios assessed for the use in orchards. (H)owever, a data gap was identified for the inclusion of the report in the updated dossier to be submitted to the Member States and EFSA. A data gap for the full exposure assessment in soil, surface water and ground water for the representative use in protected mushrooms was identified by the meeting of experts. According to the available information, long range transport and deposition of diflubenzuron may be considered negligible. Diflubenzuron was very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute EC50 for daphnids is 0.0026 mg a. s./L and the reproductive NOEC is 0.04 mu g a. s./L. A mesocosm study (littoral enclosure study) was submitted to refine the risk assessment. A regulatory end point of 0.14 mu g diflubenzuron/L was derived from the study. The regulatory end point can be used only in the risk assessment for zooplankton since the end point does not cover sensitive species with longer life cycles and a data gap was identified to address the risk to amphipods and univoltine insect species. The Annex VI trigger values were far below the trigger of 1 for zooplankton for the use in (or)chards even with a 30 m no-spray buffer zone. The TER was 2 for the use in forestry with a no-spray buffer zone of 20 m (hand application). Overall it was concluded that a high risk to aquatic organisms was indicated for the representative uses in orchards and forestry. Uncertainty remained with regard to the risk to bees since increased mortality of adult bees was observed in one of the field studies. It was not possible to exclude that the outdoor uses pose a high risk to bees on the basis of the peer reviewed data. Risk mitigation measures such as restriction of the use to non-flowering crops or specific growth stages are required to protect honey bees. Juvenile non-target arthropods were very sensitive to diflubenzuron. Very large in-field no-spray buffer zones would be needed to protect nontarget arthropods ( 75 m for the use in orchards). No higher-tier studies ( aged residues studies, semi- field or field studies) were submitted to refine the risk assessment. It was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods is high and that it needs to be demonstrated that recovery/recolonisationis possible within one year. A conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms from the use in mushrooms can only be drawn after a reliable estimation of exposure of surface water will be made available. The risk to all other groups of non- target organisms was considered to be low. The risk to birds and mammals, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses in orchards and forestry.",NA,,,,,1706

The insecticide was added to the shrimps' rearing water at two concentrations: 16 ng of active ingredient/L and 1 mu g/L. The shrimps were exposed to Dimilin from stage A (newly molted shrimp) to Stage C (Intermolt), where mineralization and deposition of the cuticular layers are completed. The results show a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the amounts of chitin in the treated batches as compared to controls for both assays. Moreover, there was a significant difference (p< 0.05) in the cuticular proteins between treated and control individuals. However, the compound had no significant effect on the amounts of calcium salts. Regarding GSH level, there was a significant inhibition (p< 0.05) in treated individuals as compared to controls. Our results show an induction of the detoxification system and confirm the mechanism of action of Dimilin on chitin biosynthesis. and indicate that this product can pose side-effects on non-target Arthropod organism like shrimps.",NA,,,,,1706
