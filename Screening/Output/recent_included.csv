10.1002/cbdv.202402934,2,0,2,Nano-Formulated Pyraclostrobin With Iron Bismuthide Enhances Efficient Utilization of Active Ingredient and Improves Biosafety,950,"Huang, FC; Zhang, TY; Zhu, LS; Wang, HY; Zhao, YJ; Wang, ZJ; Huang, QC",2025,"The widespread application of pyraclostrobin (PYR), an important strobilurin fungicide with low utilization efficiency, urgently requires optimization for sustainable agriculture. In this study, nanoformulated PYR with nano-iron bismuthide (FeBi) was successfully prepared via flash nanoprecipitation, yielding spherical PYR/FeBi nanoparticles (NPs, Phi 120 nm) with stable drug loading capacity (67.9%) and controlled release. These NPs exhibited enhanced anti-Botrytis activity in vitro and superior in vivo performance. On tomato leaves, PYR/FeBi NPs at 80 mu g/mL achieved greater than 90% curative and protective efficacy against Botrytis cinerea infection and significantly mitigated lesion expansion, surpassing commercial PYR suspension concentrate (SC) at equivalent concentrations. On tomato seedlings, PYR/FeBi NPs significantly reduced gray mold disease by 89%, compared to 67% with PYR SC at the same concentration. The mechanism underlying this enhanced activity involved stronger disruption of mitochondrial metabolism, including acetylation process, oxalate production, and damage to mycelia and conidia. Further, PYR/FeBi NPs displayed reduced cytotoxicity on human Hek293 and Chinese hamster V79 cells compared to PYR SC. The results highlighted the biocompatibility and potential of PYR/FeBi NPs for efficient utilization of active ingredients in sustainable agriculture.",CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY,NA,NA,NA,Nano
10.1002/etc.5961,3,0,3,"Biomarkers at the Individual and Biochemical Level: Effects of Pure and Formulated Lambda-Cyhalothrin in Boana pulchella Tadpoles (Duméril and Bibron, 1841)",120,Barreto E.; Villanova J.; Parra C.; Flores M.; Salgado Costa C.; Lascano C.; Natale G.; Venturino A.,2024,"We compared the effects of lambda-cyhalothrin as the pure active ingredient and as a formulated product (Zero®), on the larval stage of the autochthonous species Boana pulchella. We evaluated ecotoxicological endpoints, behavioral and developmental alterations, and the biochemical detoxifying, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress responses, covering a wide concentration range from environmental to high application levels. Both pyrethroid preparations displayed similar ecotoxicity (median lethal concentration of ~0.5 mg/L), with the lethal effect of Zero® being more pronounced than that of the active ingredient. Sublethal behavioral alterations in natatory activity were observed at 1000 times lower concentrations, indicating the ecological hazard of tadpole exposure to this pyrethroid at environmentally relevant concentrations. Biochemical endpoints in B. pulchella larvae showed significant responses to lambda-cyhalothrin in the ng/L range; these responses were different for the pure or the formulated product, and they were variable at higher concentrations. Principal components analysis confirmed the prevalence of biochemical responses as early endpoints at the lowest lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations; the Integrated Biomarker Response Index proportionally increased with pyrethroid concentration in a similar way for the pure and the formulated products. We conclude that lambda-cyhalothrin is of concern from an environmental perspective, with particular emphasis on autochthonous anuran development. The battery of biochemical biomarkers included in our study showed a consistent integrated biomarker response, indicating that this is a potent tool for monitoring impacts on amphibians.

10.1002/ps.7564,2,0,2,A high adhesion co-assembly based on myclobutanil and tannic acid for sustainable plant disease management,419,Li X.; Zhou Z.; Huang Y.; Tang G.; Liu Y.; Chen X.; Yan G.; Wang H.; Zhang X.; Wang J.; Cao Y.,2023,"Background: Pesticides are irreplaceable inputs for protecting crops from pests and improving crop yield and quality. Self-assembly nanotechnology is a promising strategy by which to develop novel nano-formulations for pesticides. Nano-formulations improve the effective utilization of pesticides and reduce risks to the environment because of their eco-friendly preparation, high drug loading, and desirable physicochemical properties. Here, to enhance the utilization efficiency of myclobutanil (MYC) and develop a novel nano-formulation, carrier-free co-assembled nanoparticles (MT NPs) based on MYC and tannic acid (TA) were prepared by noncovalent molecular interactions using a green preparation process without any additives. Results: The results showed that the prepared spherical nanoparticles had good stability in neutral and acidic aqueous solutions, low surface tension (40.53 mN m−1), high rainfastness, and good maximum retention values on plant leaves. Release of active ingredients from MT NPs could be regulated by altering the molar ratio of subassemblies in the co-assembly and the pH of the environment. Antifungal experiments demonstrated that MT NPs had better activities against Alternaria alternata and Fusarium graminearum [half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 6.40 and 77.08 mg/L] compared with free MYC (EC50 = 11.46 and 124.82 mg/L), TA (EC50 = 251.19 and 503.81 mg/L), and an MYC + TA mixture (EC50 = 9.62 and 136.21 mg/L). These results suggested that MYC and TA incorporated in the co-assembled nanoparticles had a synergistic antifungal activity. The results of a genotoxicity assessment indicated that MT NPs could reduce the genotoxicity of MYC to plant cells. Conclusion: Co-assembled MT NPs with synergistic antifungal activity have outstanding potential for the management of plant diseases. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",Pest Management Science,79,3796,3807,Nano
10.1002/ps.7625,1,1,2,Effects of fungicides on fitness and Buchnera endosymbiont density in Aphis gossypii,457,Gao Y.-F.; Ren Y.-J.; Chen J.-C.; Cao L.-J.; Qiao G.-H.; Zong S.-X.; Hoffmann A.A.; Wei S.-J.; Yang Q.,2023,"Background: Several agricultural fungicides are known to affect insect pests directly and these effects may be transgenerational and mediated through impacts on endosymbionts, providing opportunities for pest control. The cotton aphid Aphis gossypii is a polyphagous pest that can cause large crop yield losses. Here, we tested the effects of three fungicides, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and chlorothalonil, on the fitness and Buchnera endosymbiont of A. gossypii. Results: The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, and the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin produced dose-dependent mortality in A. gossypii, whereas there was no dose-dependent mortality for chlorothalonil. The formulations of trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin significantly reduced the lifespan and fecundity of A. gossypii, and increased the density of Buchnera in the parental generation but not the (unexposed) F1. When the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin was tested, the lifespan of the F0 generation was also reduced, but the density of Buchnera was not, indicating that non-insecticidal chemicals in the fungicide formulation may affect the density of the endosymbiont of A. gossypii. There was no transgenerational effect of the active ingredient of pyraclostrobin on the lifespan and Buchnera of (unexposed) F1. Conclusions: Our results suggest that formulations of two strobilurin fungicides have immediate impacts on the fitness of A. gossypii, and chemicals in the formulation impact the density of the primary Buchnera endosymbiont. Our study highlights the potential effects of non-insecticidal chemicals of fungicides on aphid pests and their primary endosymbionts but direct connections between fitness and Buchnera densities remain unclear. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",Pest Management Science,79,4282,4289,Normal

Even less-explored are the effects of commercial insecticides formulated with more than one active product. Short- and long-term lethal and sublethal effects were studied for the first time on the progeny of commercial formulations of spirotetramat, imidacloprid and a commercial mixture of these active ingredients on pupae of Diaeretiella rapae (M'ntosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), an endoparasitoid of aphids considered to be a potential biological control agent. Insecticides were exposed topically on aphid mummies in which the parasitoid was in the pupal stage. RESULTSImidacloprid reduced adult emergence by more than 30% and prolonged intra-host development time with respect to control from half the maximum recommended field dose (MFRD). Spirotetramat and commercial mixture only showed significant effects on these endpoints at doses above the MFRD. The tested formulations did not affect adult longevity, sex ratio, and percentage of parasitism in the exposed generation. At low concentrations the active ingredients in the commercial mixture behave synergistically, whereas at medium and high concentrations they behave antagonistically. Considering the 10% lethal dose (LD10), imidacloprid showed the highest hazard coefficient, whereas the commercial mixture was more hazardous when considering the LD50 and LD90. The commercial mixture and imidacloprid induced higher adult emergence and altered the sex ratio in the progeny. CONCLUSIONSThe following order of toxicity on D. rapae can be established: imidacloprid > commercial mixture > spirotetramat. Joint use of this species with imidacloprid and commercial mixture should be avoided in integrated pest management programs.

10.1002/smll.202406733,2,0,2,Construction of Iron-Modified Lignin-Based Nanomicrocapsules for Enhancing the Functionality of Natural Product–Based Pesticides,1020,Han X.; Wang Q.; Wu J.; Qiao Y.; Kong Y.; Lou Y.; Gao Y.; Shang S.; Song Z.; Li J.,2025,"To address the issue of low pesticide utilization owing to poor dispersibility, low leaf surface adhesion, and poor transport within plants, this study exploits electrostatic interactions between sodium lignosulfonate (SL) and dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) to induce self-assembly, followed by iron ion (Fe3+) chelation and loading with a natural product–based pesticide, rosin–based triazole derivative (RTD), yielding RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe nanomicrocapsules (NMs). It is worth noting that the presence of Fe3+ enhances the dispersibility of the NMs. The water dispersibility and photostability of RTD are significantly improved after encapsulation, and a stimulus response to laccase is achieved. Leaf-washing experiments confirm the enhanced adhesion of RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs to the surface of rice plant leaves compared to that of free RTD. Fluorescently labeled NMs exhibit bidirectional transport within rice plants, and RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs demonstrates better transport performance than RTD. In vitro and in vivo antifungal tests indicate that encapsulation by NMs significantly enhanced pesticide activity. Field trials demonstrate that NMs exhibited prolonged efficacy compared to RTD. Finally, the safety evaluation confirms the environmental friendliness of the NMs. This study provides valuable insight for optimizing and improving the utilization efficiency and biosafety of natural product–based pesticides. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Small,21,NA,NA,Nano
10.1007/978-3-031-41333-9_10,1,0,1,Relevance of Nanopesticides and Nanofertilizers in Sustainable Agriculture,573,Nazeer A.; Ahmad F.; Verma N.; Ahmad S.,2023,"In recent years, an increasing number of nanopesticides have been developed with the basic purpose of improving pesticide efficiencies and reducing their impact on the environment and human health. However, knowledge about their environmental interactions is still very limited. In a recent study, efforts were made to compare the soil fate and bioaccumulation of four model nanopesticides (namely, chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole loaded on polymeric and lipid nanocarriers) relative to the conventional formulations and pure active ingredients in containing earthworms and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in two soils over a period of 4 months. These nanoformulations increased the soil half-life of the pesticides by twofold as a direct consequence of the slow release of the pesticide. Pesticide bioaccumulation in earthworms was often increased, probably as a result of their enhanced bioavailability. The pesticide bioaccumulation was also shown to affect plants, but with an inconsistent trend. Overall, the microcosmic results demonstrated that nanoformulations can significantly alter the fate and bioavailability of pesticides. However, generalisations are still difficult to make as the impacts depend on the type of nanocarrier, pesticide, soil used, and time scale. It could only be concluded that this study helped in judging the benefits versus risks of nanopesticides. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Nanotechnology in the Life Sciences,NA,155,163,Normal

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al. (1986), Schmuck et al. (1994), APHA (1995), and Demetrio et al. (2014). It was concluded from the study that the emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos was more toxic than technical-grade chlorpyrifos. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,113,NA,NA,Normal
10.1007/s00572-025-01199-3,2,0,2,"Fungicide seed treatments delay arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization of winter wheat in the greenhouse, but the effect is attenuated in the field",94,Brieuc H.; Eléonore B.; Bruno H.; Stéphane D.; Maryline C.-S.,2025,"Seed-applied fungicides support agricultural production by controlling seed- or soil-borne diseases. However, they can impact non-target soil organisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of eight seed treatments (including two authorized for organic farming) on root colonization of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. One experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions, on a sterile substrate inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833 and one in field conditions, where winter wheat was colonized by native soil AM fungi. In greenhouse conditions, the six conventional seed treatments reduced root colonization five weeks after sowing. No difference with the control treatment was measured thereafter for a product containing triazole alone. In contrast, seed treatments containing fludioxonil (fungicide molecule alone or formulated with the triazole difenoconazole), and prochloraz formulated with the triazole triticonazole significantly reduced root colonization until 11 weeks after sowing. Notably, when formulated with sedaxane, the adverse effect of fludioxonil was reduced. The negative effect of seed treatments on AM fungal root colonization in field was smaller than in the greenhouse and generally not significant, with disparate results from one timestep to another. This may be related to the dilution or the degradation of the active ingredients in the soil during the winter period or AM fungal species/strain involved in symbiosis. Overall, our results outline that the direct effect of seed treatment is highly variable depending on the modes of action, half-lives and interactions between active ingredients. By contributing to highlight the undesired effects of pesticides on AM fungi (i.e., by delaying root colonization), this study pleads for a reduction of pesticide applications to encourage the rapid and efficient establishment of functional mycorrhizal symbioses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Mycorrhiza,35,NA,NA,Normal
10.1007/s10646-023-02648-5,4,0,4,Ecotoxicity of pesticide formulations and their mixtures: the case of potato crops in Costa Rica,542,Méndez-Rivera M.; Ramírez-Morales D.; Montiel-Mora J.R.; Rodríguez-Rodríguez C.E.,2023,"Despite their environmental implications, ecotoxicological information regarding pesticide mixtures is relatively scarce. This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value. The commercial formulation composed of deltamethrin+imidacloprid followed the concentration addition model (when compared with parameters retrieved from individual a.i.) and the other three mixtures evaluated (I: chlorothalonil-propineb-deltamethrin+imidacloprid; II: chlorothalonil-propineb-ziram-thiocyclam; III: chlorothalonil-propineb-chlorpyrifos) produced an antagonistic effect on D. magna, thus suggesting less acute toxicity than their individual components. Subsequent chronic studies showed that one of the most toxic mixtures (II) negatively affected D. magna reproduction at sublethal concentrations indicating that this mixture poses a risk to this species if these pesticides co-exist in freshwater systems. These findings provide useful data to better estimate the impact of real agricultural practices related to the use of agrochemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Ecotoxicology,32,383,393,Normal
10.1007/s10646-024-02806-3,6,0,6,Acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos to some non-target freshwater organisms: which one is more toxic—technical grade or commercial formulation?,130,Majumder R.,2024,"Chlorpyrifos is among the most widely sold organophosphates in the agriculture sector worldwide. Static bioassays were performed in the laboratory to compare the acute toxicity between the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to four freshwater organisms: the crustacean zooplankton Cyclops viridis, the oligochaete worm Branchiura sowerbyi, the gastropod Pila globosa, and tadpole larvae of Duttaphrynus melanostictus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations in water after 2 h of exposure to the nominal concentrations ranged from 82.98% to 88.56%. The commercial formulation (F) of chlorpyrifos was found to be 1.94 to 2.76 times more toxic than the technical grade (T). Based on 96 h LC50 values of T and F chlorpyrifos, C. viridis was found to be most sensitive (0.56 and 0.25 μg/L) and P. globosa as most tolerant (1482 and 536 μg/L) to chlorpyrifos. Changes in LC50 values of both T and F chlorpyrifos were noted in respect of exposure hours for the three aquatic invertebrates and the tadpole larvae of the toad. In conclusion, the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos to some non-target freshwater organisms differs between technical grade and commercial formulations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Ecotoxicology,33,1171,1179,Normal

Despite the great role played by nanopesticides in pest and disease control, their toxicological effects cannot be ignored. But the state of knowledge on the biotoxicological effects of nanopesticides is limited, particularly regarding to their environmental fate and behavior. Based on this situation, we discuss the characteristics and applications of five examples of nanopesticide formulations whose nanomaterials react with active ingredients; we analyze the behavior and ecotoxicity of nanopesticides in the environment, mainly in soil and the three aspects of toxic effects; and we discuss the issues that need attention in risk assessment and management. Although there are some challenges and concerns about nanopesticides, in the long run, nanopesticides are worthy of further study and have good prospects for development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Journal of Nanoparticle Research,25,NA,NA,Review
10.1007/s11356-024-35221-6,1,0,1,"Toxicity of paclobutrazol-based pesticide on Lactuca sativa L.: germination, seedling development, and DNA damage",166,Silveira G.L.; dos Santos F.E.; Alvarenga I.F.S.; de Lima M.G.F.; Bicalho E.M.; Andrade-Vieira L.,2024,"Paclobutrazol, a fungicide of the triazole class, is widely used as an inducer of early flowering and fruiting by inhibiting gibberellin formation. However, biological assays using model organisms to evaluate their cytogenotoxic and mutagenic potential are still scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of the commercial product Cultar® 250 SC (CP) and the pure substance (PBZ) on the germination and initial seedling development of Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce), in addition to evaluating the effects of CP on the mitotic activity and DNA, as we believe that PBZ has a greater toxic potential than CP on seed germination, and that the latter has cytogenotoxic and mutagenic effects on L. sativa. Lettuce seeds treated with CP and with PBZ in the doses of 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, and 2 g L−1 showed significant reductions in germination rate, as well the CP reduced the root and initial development seedling development. PBZ showed greater inhibition of germination compared to CP. In direct exposure to PBZ, there was not sufficient seedling development for analysis, while in discontinuous treatment, there was inhibition of root growth (except for doses of 0.25 and 0.50 g L−1) and in the development of the aerial part. While no mitodepressive effect was observed in meristematic cells treated with CP, increased frequencies of chromosomal alterations, including condensed nuclei and micronuclei, were evident in both meristematic cells and the F1 region. The Comet assay further demonstrated higher levels of DNA damage at higher paclobutrazol doses, supporting the findings of increased micronucleus frequencies. Consequently, it can be concluded that the CP exhibits greater toxicity towards seed germination compared to lettuce seedlings, and PBZ has a greater toxic potential than CP in relation to these parameters. However, the impact of CP on seedlings was relatively minimal, as evidenced by their limited effects on development, cell proliferation, and DNA, suggesting a slight toxicity of this agent. Therefore, we infer that Cultar® 250 SC should be used with caution. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of employing joint analyses to better elucidate and correlate the mechanisms of action of potentially toxic substances. Furthermore, it provides a basis for discussing the application of Cultar® 250 SC and seeking more sustainable alternatives in food production.

Results revealed a statistically significant increase in sperm motility at the highest concentration of the formulated product.

The advantage of using nanoagrochemicals compared to conventional ones is that to achieve the same biological effect, a quantitatively smaller amount of active ingredient can be used, and when using encapsulation of the active agent or its adsorption on a suitable nanocarrier, its controlled prolonged release can be achieved, which at the same time reduces the adverse impact on the environment. Nanoagrochemicals are also generally less toxic than conventional agrochemicals, however, some of them can be more toxic to aquatic flora and fauna even at sublethal concentrations.

To evaluate the adverse effects caused in adults of Danio rerio species exposed to the pesticides abamectin, difenoconazole, and their commercial formulations (Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC®), both isolated and in mixtures, biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in the gills of organisms exposed to sublethal concentrations. To this end, the activities of the enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), lipid hydroperoxide (LH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were measured after 48 h of exposure to the different pesticide treatments. The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations.

Our aim was to estimate 48 h-LC50 and sub-chronic effects after the exposure to low concentrations of chlorpyrifos as commercial formulation (CF) and active ingredient (AI) on B. straminea adult, embryos and juveniles. Concentrations between 1 and 5000 μg L−1 were chosen for acute exposures and 0.1 and 1 μg L−1 for the sub-chronic one. After 14 days biochemical parameters, viability and sub-populations of hemocytes, reproductive parameters, embryotoxicity and offspring' survival were studied. Egg masses laid between day 12 and 14 were separated to continue the exposure and the embryos were examined daily. Offspring' survival and morphological changes were registered for 14 days after hatching. 48 h-LC50, NOEC and LOEC were similar between CF and AI, however the CF caused more sub-lethal effects. CF but not the AI decreased carboxylesterases, catalase and the proportion of hyalinocytes with respect to the total hemocytes, and increased superoxide dismutase and the % of granulocytes with pseudopods. Also CF caused embryotoxicity probably due to the increase of embryos' membrane permeability. Acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, hemocytes sub-populations, the time and rate of hatching and juveniles' survival were the most sensitive biomarkers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the lethal effects of the active ingredient and a commercial formulation of IVM (1 % active ingredient) in the embryonic stage (S. 4-6) and larval stage (S. 25) of the South American amphibian Rhinella arenarum through chronic standardized bioassays. Also, behavior analysis and oxidative stress and cholinergic effects biomarkers were analyzed at 1, 10 and 100 mu g IVM/L concentrations. For the embryonic stage, the active ingredient (96 h- LC 50 : 15900 mu g/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC 50 : 51230 mu g/L) during the acute period, while at chronic exposure the commercial formulation was more toxic (504 h-LC 50 : 10.25 mu g/L), compared to the active ingredient (504 h-LC 50 : 312.80 mu g/L). For the larval stage, in acute exposure, the active ingredient (96 h-LC 50 : 800 mu g/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC 50 : 1550 mu g/L). In the chronic exposure, the commercial formulation (504 h-LC 50 : 77.33 mu g/L) was more toxic than the active ingredient (504 h-LC 50 : 195.25 mu g/L). Overall, larvae exhibited greater sensitivity to both the active ingredient and the commercial formulation. However, during chronic exposure, embryos were more sensitive to the commercial formulation than larvae. The commercial formulation primarily induced oxidative stress, and both forms of the compound affected behavior and cholinergic effect biomarkers, even at low environmentally relevant concentrations (1 mu g/L).

Despite the efforts of regulatory agencies, there still is a lack of information regarding short- and long-term exposures to soil-dwellers, as well as effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT (R) and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00-1.49 mg of the active ingredient & sdot;kg- 1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT (R) at >= 0.66 mg kg- 1 and SPIN at >= 0.13 mg kg- 1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT (R) at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg- 1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT (R) and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT (R) and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT (R) on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT (R) and SPIN. The results suggest that spinosynsbased products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems.",COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY,287,NA,NA,Bio

In this study, the application of a chlorfenapyr (CF)-loaded iron-based metal–organic framework (CF@MIL-101-SL) to maize and its control efficacy for Spodoptera frugiperda were investigated in detail. The results showed that, compared with a suspension concentrate of CF (CF-SC), a solution of CF@MIL-101-SL with the surfactant aerosol OT exhibited excellent wetting, deposition and adhesion with maize leaves. The CF@MIL-101-SL NPs exhibited bidirectional translocation in maize, which significantly enhanced the transport of CF to the target tissues. Field trials revealed that CF@MIL-101-SL maintained > 75 % control efficiency after 21 d of spraying, indicating significantly greater insecticidal activity and persistence than CF-SC. Spray application of CF@MIL-101-SL gave high initial deposition rates, long half-lives on tender and old leaves and significantly reduced pesticide drift into the environment. Based on a biosafety assessment, spraying with CF@MIL-101-SL reduced the negative effects of CF on plants during the growth period. In addition, CF@MIL-101-SL increased the survival rate of Harmonia axyridis larvae and reduced the impacts of CF on the growth and intestinal damage of Harmonia axyridis.

The nanocapsule-based pesticide delivery systems combine the advantages of nanotechnology and advanced materials to achieve on-demand and accurately targeted release. Herein, a facile and universal strategy was used to fabricate photosensitive pesticide nanocapsules using a versatile imine polymer derived from cinnamaldehyde (CIN) and ε-poly-L-lysine (PLL). Characterization results demonstrated that the nanocapsules prepared under optimal conditions exhibited uniform sizes (200–400 nm) and high encapsulation efficiency (>90 %). Photodegradation experiments revealed a significant increase of half-lives (7.21–55.57 times) under UV irradiation for the different pesticide nanocapsules. Furthermore, the pesticide nanocapsules demonstrated a high biological activity and excellent physicochemical properties, including pH-responsive release, maximum retention, and rain erosion resistance. The results of the mechanistic studies on the increased biological activity indicated that the nanocapsules could be adsorbed on the surface of target pathogenic cells and then released CIN and PLL, destroying the integrity of the cell membrane, and synergistically and effectively eradicating the pathogen with pesticide. Additionally, nanocapsules exhibited lower toxicity to zebrafish and genetic toxicity to Vicia faba than pesticide technical.

The use of pesticide carriers to deliver pesticides can help to prevent rapid release, assist in targeted release, and improve pesticide utilization. However, after completing pesticide delivery, less part of pesticide carriers has more functions and may remain in the environment, leading to material waste and environmental burden. Here, we propose that the environment-friendly carrier materials for pesticide delivery can synergistically enhance control efficacy with pesticides. Based on the bio-stimulant polyglutamic acid, amphiphilic polymers (mPEG-b-PLG) were constructed, and they assembled into nano micelle. After encapsulating prothioconazole (PTC) into the nano micelle through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions through co-assembly, mPEG-b-PLG-PTC nanospheres with a diameter of approximately 120 nm were prepared. The nanospheres exhibit pH responsiveness for targeted release of pesticides, as well as excellent retention capacity, droplet bounce inhibition ability, and deposition capacity. At the same time, compared with commercial formulations, it has long-term antifungal properties and lower EC50, while its acute toxicity to human cells is lower, which can reduce cell apoptosis by about 63 %. It is also gratifying that the main root length, plant height, and fresh weight of wheat seedlings treated with mPEG-b-PLG have significantly improved, effectively applying carrier materials for synergistic effects. In summary, this work proposes a promising strategy to synergize pesticide carrier materials as active ingredients, providing new ideas for the integration of pesticide and fertilizer, improving pesticide utilization efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Chemical Engineering Journal,491,NA,NA,Nano

In this work, we report an organic ionic cocrystal of 2,4-D with DL-proline, where both molecules self-assemble through hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice, with DL-proline maintaining its zwitterionic form. Compared to pure 2,4D, the cocrystal reduces volatility by over 70 % while exhibiting excellent stability at room temperature. Furthermore, the cocrystal enhances the release profile of the active compound across a range of temperatures (15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 35 degrees C), with a solubility increase of more than 2.8-fold. Moreover, the cocrystal reduces the evaporation rate of the solution, leading to a longer retention time on leaf surfaces. In terms of herbicidal efficacy, the cocrystal provides equivalent weed control at just 1/4 of the dosage required for pure 2,4-D. Additionally, it exhibits reduced toxicity to zebrafish and human hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes.

This study explores a novel approach using emamectin benzoate (EB) as a model pesticide, leveraging non-covalent molecular interactions to co-assemble nanocomplexes with cyclodextrin ((3-CD) and polylactic acid (PLA) conjugates ((3-CD-PLA-EB). Notably, these complexes were formulated without additional adjuvants. Optimal assembly occurred at an EB to (3-CD to PLA ratio of 1:3, yielding stable beaded structures measuring 383.02 nm. These structures derive stability from electrostatic, hydrophobic, and it-it stacking interactions, ensuring excellent solubility and durability in aqueous environments. Importantly, the (3-CD-PLA-EB formulation not only enhances the UV stability of EB but also extends its half-life significantly-nearly five times that of free EB. This formulation responds dynamically in alkaline conditions, intelligently releasing active ingredients within the alkaline intestinal microenvironment of lepidopteran pests. Rain-wash resistance tests demonstrated 50.03 % greater retention of (3-CD-PLA-EB on corn leaves compared to EB WG suspension. Indoor and field trials further revealed enhanced residual activity and prolonged efficacy of (3-CD-PLA-EB over EB WG, while also mitigating drug solution drift during application.

Nanotechnology can efficiently be used to improve the utilization rate and enhance the efficacy of herbicides for advanced modern sustainable agriculture. Herein, a novel smart delivery system was developed to promote permeability performance and precision targeting of weeds for enhanced herbicidal activity. The current study designed and applied an efficient and eco-friendly nano-herbicide via metamifop (MP) modified by hydrophilic and lipophilic diblock polymer (HLDP), namely MP@HLDP. The HLDP was assembled with MP via electrostatic interaction, and the spontaneous complexation of MP with HLDP formed nearly spherical nanoparticles. The presence of HLDP reduced the contact angle of MP while increasing its retention, resulting in better foliar wettability and easier spreading of the droplets on weed leaves. Meanwhile, the plant uptake of MP@HLDP was enhanced, remarkably improving its herbicidal activity toward weed Echinochloa crus-galli (E. crusgalli), when compared to the commercial emulsion oil and technical compound even at a 30% reduced dosage. The conjoint analysis of transcriptomic and metabolome data indicated activation of the plant death responses by MP@HLDP nanoparticles through inhibiting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and chlorophyll metabolism. The safety evaluation of MP@HLDP nanoparticles on rice crops and systematic model nontarget organism revealed good safety to rice seedlings with reduced acute toxicity to aquatic zebrafish.

Additionally, their production involves synthetic chemicals and generates large amounts of by-products, further exacerbating the ecological burden. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an environmentally friendly nanodelivery system that can enhance the efficacy of pesticides while minimizing both environmental and health risks. Here, a metal mineralization strategy was employed to reinforce the self-assembly of biocompatible nanocapsules with versatile surface functionalities for smart delivery of lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT). During the homogenization process, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), chitosan (COS), and copper ions co-precipitated at the oil–water interface and self-assembled into core–shell nanocapsules, acquiring the desired surface functionality through electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and metal coordination. The resulting LCT@CMC@COS-Cu nanocapsules demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency for LCT and superior pesticide delivery performance targeting lepidopteran pests, enabled by the alkaline- and cellulase-responsive polysaccharide-based capsule shells. Foliar washing experiments demonstrated that LCT@CMC@COS-Cu adhere efficiently to the surface of soybean leaves and achieved bidirectional transport through the plant's vascular system. Notably, LCT@CMC@COS-Cu significantly extended the half-life of LCT under UV irradiation by 9.9-fold compared to technical LCT. In pot experiments, the mortality rate of Spodoptera litura larvae treated with LCT@CMC@COS-Cu (56.67 %) was significantly higher than that of the LCT suspension concentrate (16.67 %) after 12 days, implying prolonged efficacy.

To support the safety of nano-enabled pesticides, the present study aimed at assessing the toxicity of the commercial Npe NUCOP-M and the active substance copper oxychloride, using the ecotoxicological soil model Enchytraeus crypticus and LUFA 2.2 soil. Bioassays were performed to assess various endpoints within short-to longer-term exposures: avoidance behaviour (2 d), hatching (13 d), survival, reproduction and organisms’ size (based on the standard OECD test (28 d), the OECD extension (56 d), and the Full Life Cycle test – FLCt (46 d)). Based on the standard OECD test and its extension, NUCOP-M had a similar level of toxicity as copper oxychloride without indications of increase in toxicity over time (28 versus 56 d). The shorter-term exposures (2 and 13 d) showed higher toxicity for copper oxychloride. The exposure from cocoon stage (FLCt) seemed to provide an adaptative advantage (reduced toxicity) to NUCOP-M. The differences might be related to a slower release of Cu2+ ions from NUCOP-M, which seems to account for the toxicity at longer-term. Based on the recommended application doses (ca. 1.72 mg NUCOP-M kg−1, i.e. 0.62 mg Cu kg−1 in the topsoil) there is no unacceptable risk of NUCOP-M on the enchytraeid population. © 2024 The Authors",Chemosphere,367,NA,NA,Nano

Pesticides like the herbicide glyphosate have garnered considerable attention due to their well-documented harmful effects on non-target species. During application, the active ingredient glyphosate is utilized in various formulations, each containing different additive adjuvants. However, the possible effects of these formulations on amphibians - the group with the highest decline rates among vertebrates - remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of four glyphosate formulations (Glyphosat TF, Durano TF, Helosate 450 TF, Kyleo) on the embryonic development of the model organism Xenopus laevis (South African clawed frog). Embryos at the 2-cell stage were exposed to various concentrations of glyphosate formulations (glyphosate: 0.01–100 mg/L), and mortality as well as sublethal effects on different organs and tissues were analyzed. The results indicated that the formulations had different effects, particularly on the mortality of Xenopus laevis embryos. At sublethal concentrations, the formulations altered the embryos' external appearance, leading to malformations such as reduced eye and head size. In addition, exposure to formulations impaired heart morphology and function, and the expression of heart-specific genes was altered at a molecular level. Our results confirmed that glyphosate formulations had a stronger effect on Xenopus laevis embryogenesis than pure glyphosate. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the active ingredient and the co-formulations independently, as well as the combined, commercially available products, during pesticide risk assessments and renewal procedures of agrochemicals.

The properties of nanopesticides make their drift and environmental behavior more unpredictable than traditional formulations. Our aim was to compare the ecotoxicity of two insecticides with λ-cyhalothrin as a.i.: a nano-based one and a traditional emulsified, considering the incidence of temperature according to climate change prospections (20 and 24 °C). We evaluated their effects on Daphnia magna survival, body stores, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity. Although after 24 h the traditional formulation had greater lethality than the nanopesticide, after 48 h this pattern was reversed. At 24 °C the lethality of both pesticides increased. BChE activity was inhibited at 24 °C by both pesticides. In general, the increase in temperature negatively affected protein and glycogen content. The traditional formulation reduced glycogen content at 24 °C. A decrease in lipid content and the whole energy budget was observed in organisms exposed to the traditional formulation at both temperatures. Although the nano-based pesticide developed a delayed toxicity, it was more lethal than the traditional one in the long term. The temperature rise worsened the pesticides effects in terms of decreased survival, BChE activity inhibition, and energy reserves depletion.

Surfactants can promote the bioavailability of organic compounds for enhanced microbial degradation, but the performance depends on soil and surfactant properties, sorption-desorption equilibria of contaminants and surfactants, and possible adverse effects of surfactants on microorganisms. This study investigated the influence of five surfactants [e.g., Triton X-100 (TX-100), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA), Aerosol 22 and Tween 80] on the sorption-desorption, degradation, and mobility of CTL and OH-CTL in two volcanic and one non-volcanic soil. Sorption and desorption of fungicides depended on the sorption of surfactants on soils, surfactants' capacity to neutralize the net negative charge of soils, surfactants’ critical micellar concentration, and pH of soils. HDTMA was strongly adsorbed on soils, which shifted the fungicide sorption equilibria by increasing the distribution coefficient (Kd) values. Contrarily, SDS and TX-100 lowered CTL and OH-CTL sorption on soils by decreasing the Kd values, which resulted in an efficient extraction of the fungicide compounds from soil. SDS increased the degradation of CTL, especially in the non-volcanic soil (DT50 values were 14 and 7 days in natural and amended soils, with final residues <7% of the initial dose), whereas TX-100 enabled an early start and sustenance of OH-CTL degradation in all soils. CTL and OH-CTL stimulated soil microbial activities without noticeable deleterious effects of the surfactants. SDS and TX-100 also reduced the vertical transport of OH-CTL in soils.

Population- and community trends were assessed and compared in response to the nano-formulation and its constituents applied individually (i.e. nano-sized TiO2, carbendazim) and in combination (i.e. nano-sized TiO2 & carbendazim). Minimal differences were observed between effects induced by the nano-formulation and its active ingredient (i.e. carbendazim) when applied at equivalent nominal test concentrations (4 μg L−1). Nano-sized TiO2 was found to affect zooplankton community trends when applied separately at environmentally realistic concentrations (20 μg L−1 nominal test concentration). However, when nano-sized TiO2 was applied in combination with carbendazim, nano-sized TiO2 was found not to alter effects on community trends induced by carbendazim.

GBHs are commonly used worldwide in weed control management. Due to their extensive application, they frequently occur in aquatic ecosystems and may affect various organisms. The active substance GLY and its major by-product, AMPA, are the most thoroughly studied chemicals; however, the adverse effects of the complex formulas of GBHs with diverse and unknown content of co-formulants are still not sufficiently researched. This study focused on the embryotoxicity, sublethal malformations, and estrogenic potency of GLY, AMPA, and four commonly used GBHs on zebrafish embryos using a wild type and an estrogen-sensitive, transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(vtg1:mCherry)). After 120 h of exposition, AMPA did not cause acute toxicity, while the LC50 of GLY was 160 mg/L. The GBHs were more toxic with LC50 values ranging from 31 to 111 GLY active equivalent (a.e.) mg/L. Exposure to 0.35–2.8 mg/L GBHs led to sublethal abnormalities: typical symptoms were structural deformation of the lower jaw and anomalies in the olfactory region. Deformity rates were 10–30% in the treated groups. In vivo, fluorescently expressed vtg1 mCherry protein in embryonic liver was detected by a non-invasive microscopic method indicating estrogenic action through vitellogenin production by GLY, AMPA, and GBHs. To confirm the in vivo findings, RT-qPCR method was performed to determine the levels of the estrogenicity-related vtg1 mRNA. After 120 h of exposure to GLY, AMPA, and three GBHs at a concentration of 0.35 mg/L, the expression of vtg1 gene was significantly up-regulated. Our results highlight the risk that short-term GLY and GBH exposure can cause developmental malformations and disrupt the hormonal balance in zebrafish embryos. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental Pollution,342,NA,NA,Normal

Although GLY/GBH was previously considered to be non-toxic, growing evidence indicates that GLY/GBH negatively affects some animal taxa. However, there has been no systematic analysis quantifying its toxicity to animals. Therefore, we used a meta-analytical approach to determine whether there is a demonstrable effect of GLY/GBH toxicity across animals. We further addressed whether the effects of GLY/GBH vary due to (1) taxon (invertebrate vs. vertebrate), (2) habitat (aquatic vs. terrestrial), (3) type of biological response (behavior vs. physiology vs. survival), and (4) dosage or concentration of GLY/GBH. Using this approach, we also determined whether adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) in commercial formulations of GBHs increased toxicity for animals relative to exposure to GLY alone. We analyzed 1282 observations from 121 articles. We conclude that GLY is generally sub-lethally toxic for animals, particularly for animals in aquatic or marine habitats, and that toxicity did not exhibit dose-dependency. Yet, our analyses detected evidence for widespread publication bias so we encourage continued experimental investigations to better understand factors influencing GLY/GBH toxicity to animals. © 2024 The Authors",Environmental Pollution,347,NA,NA,Meta

Our work aimed to compare the toxicity induced by chlorpyrifos in its pure form (CPF) with that of a commercial formulation containing allegedly inert ingredients (CBCF) using Caenorhabditis elegans as in vivo model. After a 48 h exposure period, CBCF was 14 times more lethal than CPF; Hatching, brood size, body length and motor-related behavioral parameters were decreased, but these effects were significantly higher in CBCF-exposed worms. Additionally, CBCF induced significant morphological changes in cholinergic neurons, which are associated with the motor-related behavioral parameters. Finally, by analyzing the CBCF, we detected the presence of potentially-toxic metals that were not specified in the label.

Since the hazards of this safener, individually and in combination with its herbicide, toward non-target aquatic organisms, were not known,acute and chronic studies were conducted on various endpoints in embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Endpoints during acute exposures included mortality and hatchability. During chronic exposures, the growth and survival of larvae were determined. Exposure to concentrations of MEF > 3 mg/L alone significantly decreased the rate of hatching, while exposure to FEN alone to > 3 mg/L had no significant effect on the rate of hatching. However, exposure to each of the chemicals individually caused some delay in hatching. When exposed in combination with FEN, adverse effects of MEF on the rate of hatching were mitigated in a dose-dependent manner. During the acute exposure to 3 mg/L, mortality was caused by MEF than FEN. During chronic exposures to 0.1 or 1.0 mg/L, MEF has more toxic potency than FEN. Both compounds caused some abnormalities, including pericardial edema, spinal curvature, tail malformation, and edema of the yoke sac. Based on the activities of SOD and GST, both MEF and FEN caused oxidative stress. FEN reduced the toxic potency of MEF when exposed together, but there were more deformities of greater severity in embryos exposed to MEF than those exposed to FEN. Molecular docking showed that both chemicals could potentially inhibit the activity of sex hormones and hatching enzymes. These results demonstrate that while classified as ""inert"", the safener, and FEN can cause various effects, including molecular responses and lethality and should be monitored and regulated. © 2023",Journal of Hazardous Materials Advances,11,NA,NA,Normal

However, current systems face challenges in achieving both high encapsulation rates and drug loading capacities. This study introduces a novel method using chitosan (CS) and sodium lignosulfonate (SL) to co-assemble with avermectin (AVM), a widely used hydrophobic pesticide, forming AVM-CS-SL micro-nano capsules. Engineered under optimized conditions of pH 5 and 40 °C, the capsules exhibit an AVM encapsulation efficiency of 84.27 % and a loading capacity of 90 %. The AVM-CS-SL capsules demonstrate multifunctional attributes that enhance pesticide application. The capsules, with an average diameter of 356 nm, facilitate stable embedding in leaf grooves and enable effective adhesion to leaf surfaces, thereby improving their resistance to wash-off by rain compared to conventional formulations. Their core-shell structure protects AVM from photodegradation, ensuring long-term stability and efficacy. The capsules also exhibit enhanced bioactivity, with higher mortality rates in Plutella xylostella larvae and low genotoxicity to Vicia faba plants.

Cinnamaldehyde is found in cinnamon essential oil and has good antifungal activity, but cinnamaldehyde also has negative characteristics such as high volatility, poor water solubility and easy oxidative degradation, which seriously hinder the potential of its antimicrobial properties and its application in agriculture. In this study, the effects of the surfactant ratio, concentration and emulsification method on the stability of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions were systematically investigated by observing the sample appearance, mean droplet size and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The results showed that the optimal formula of cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsion was a surfactant (R5:848) ratio of 1:1 and a concentration of 7%, and the emulsification method was E1: adding dropwise aqueous phase (deionized water) to the oil phase (cinnamaldehyde + surfactant). Cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsions showed good antifungal activity against rice sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani), wheat sheath blight (Rhizoctonia cerealis) and wheat take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis). The nanoemulsions also had excellent wetting properties on rice and wheat leaves, higher biosafety for nontarget environmental organisms such as zebrafish and earthworms, low cytotoxicity to human BASE-2B cells, and no inhibition of germination and growth of wheat and rice.

To counter these challenges, the development of nanoformulations represents a pivotal strategy. These advanced formulations are designed to enhance the efficacy of active ingredients (AIs) and reduce ecological impacts, thereby addressing the need for sustainable agricultural development. Objectives: The study aims to fabricate a highly leaf-adhesive and anti-UV herbicide nanoformulation, designed to enhance the herbicidal activity and utilization rates of AIs. Methods: Herein, the herbicide nanoformulations (Called CB@MSNs-TA-Fe) are synthesized by incorporating cyhalofop-butyl into tannic acid-Fe (III) ions-coated functionalized mesoporous silica. The foliar retention performance of the samples was assessed integrating SEM observation and HPLC analysis. Results: The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe with rough outer surface displays typical core–shell structure featuring an average diameter of about 118 nm. After amino modification, the CB@MSNs-TA-Fe shows enhanced loading rate for CB (14.4 ± 0.2 %) and superior thermal stability. The release rate of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe under acidic conditions is higher compared to that under alkaline and neutral conditions. Upon UV irradiation, the half-life of CB within CB@MSNs-TA-Fe nanoparticles is 12.4 times higher than that of CB technical (CB TC). Enhanced foliar adhesion of CB@MSNs-TA-Fe on hydrophobic leaf surfaces is observed, which can effectively mitigate the risk of wash-off by rainfall. The CB@MSNs-TA-Fe displays enhanced herbicidal efficacies against barnyard grass under UV irradiation or simulated rainwater scouring, compared with CB TC and CB oil dispersion. Furthermore, the TA-Fe-coated MSNs-NH2 nano-carrier (MSNs-TA-Fe) reveals excellent biosafety on rice, zebrafish, and earthworms. Conclusion: The developed TA-Fe-functionalized herbicide nanoformulations, with high foliar adhesion and anti-UV properties, effectively improve the utilization efficiency of AIs, thus offering innovative solutions for the development of efficient pesticide formulations. © 2024",Journal of Advanced Research,NA,NA,NA,Nano

Herein, fungicide tebuconazole (TEB) and plant immune inducer poly(salicylic acid) (PSA) co-assembled nanoparticles (TP NPs) are fabricated through non-covalent interactions without the use of any adjuvants. The results show that the obtained TP NPs have excellent physicochemical properties, displaying uniform morphology with an average particle size of 152 nm, low PDI (0.064), and high surface activity. The TP NPs exhibit acid-responsive behaviors, enabling the intelligent release of active ingredients in the specific acidic microenvironment caused by the invasion of plant pathogens. In vitro fungicidal activities of TP NPs are 1.9 and 1.6 times higher than TEB technical against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium graminearum respectively. Additionally, the stimuli-responsive co-delivery fungicidal nanosystem not only has a longer effective duration compared to both TEB technical and TP Mix but also significantly reduces the genetic toxicity of TEB to the plants.

The prepared nanoparticles showed a spherical core-shell structure with a loading content of 22.5 %, and the polymer coating covering the surface of the nanoparticles effectively protected IN from photolysis. Moreover, different biostimuli associated with Spodoptera frugiperda can trigger the release of IN from nanoparticles. Compared with the commercial emulsifiable concentrate (14.93 mg L−1), IN@MSN@PDA@α-CD (8.89 mg L−1) extended the effective duration of IN against Spodoptera frugiperda, and considerably decreased the toxicity of IN to Eisenia fetida, zebrafish and human BEAS-2B cells.

Herbicidal ionic liquids (ILs), in which cationic surfactants are combined with herbicidal anions, allow for additives’ reduction and ensure very good herbicide performance with lower doses. We aimed to test the impact of synthetic and natural cations on biological degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Although primary biodegradation was high, the mineralization in agricultural soil indicated incomplete conversion of ILs to CO2. Even the introduction of naturally-derived cations resulted in an increase in the herbicide's half-lives – from 32 days for [Na][2,4-D] to 120 days for [Chol][2,4-D] and 300 days for the synthetic tetramethylammonium derivative [TMA][2,4-D]. Bioaugmentation with 2,4-D-degrading strains improves the herbicides’ degradation, which was reflected by higher abundance of tfdA genes. Microbial community analysis confirmed that hydrophobic cationic surfactants, even those based on natural compounds, played a negative role on microbial biodiversity.

Commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos (COM) are the pesticides most widely used in agricultural activities, with a high toxic potential on amphibians. However, little is known about the separate effects of the active ingredient (CPF) and adjuvants (AD). We studied the thermal sensitivity at different concentrations and pesticide fractions in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles, on thermal tolerance limits (CTmax = Critical thermal maximum and CTmin = Critical thermal minimum), swimming speed (Ss), Optimum temperature (Top), and Thermal breadth 50 (B50). Our results demonstrate that the pesticide active ingredient, the adjuvants, and the commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos differentially impair the thermal sensitivity of R. arenarum tadpoles. The pesticide fractions affected the heat and the cold tolerance (CTmax and CTmin), depending on the concentrations they were exposed to. The locomotor performance (Ss, Top, and B50) of tadpoles also varied among fractions, treatments, and environmental temperatures. In the context of climate change, the outcomes presented are particularly relevant, as mean temperatures are increasing at unprecedented rates, which suggests that tadpoles inhabiting warming and polluted ponds are currently experiencing deleterious conditions. Considering that larval stages of amphibians are the most susceptible to changing environmental conditions and the alarming predictions about environmental temperatures in the future, it is likely that the synergism between high temperatures and pesticide exposure raise the threat of population deletions in the coming years. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Journal of Thermal Biology,120,NA,NA,Normal

Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) bioassays were selected to test genotoxicity. Neutral red uptake (NRU), succinic dehydrogenase activity (MTT) and apoptogenic induction were employed for estimating cytotoxicity. Both compounds were analysed within a concentration range of 0.1–100 µg/mL. Only LCT produced a significant augment in the frequency of micronuclei (MNs) when the cultures were exposed to highest concentrations of 10 and 100 µg LCT/mL. A noticeable decrease in NDI was observed for cultures treated with LCT at 10 and 100 µg/mL. Karate® induced the inhibition of both the proportion of viable cells and succinic dehydrogenase activity and triggered apoptosis 24 h of exposition. Whilst an increased GDI in CHO-K1 cells was observed in the treatments with 1–100 µg Karate®/mL, the GDI was not modified in the treatments employing LCT at equivalent doses. SCGE showed that Karate® was more prone to induce genotoxic effects than LCT. Only 50 µg/mL of Karate® was able to increase apoptosis.

Its environmental presence raises concerns about the potential detrimental effects on non-target organisms. Thus, this study aimed to increase knowledge on PAR's potential environmental impacts, assessing the effects of commercial formulation (PAR-c) and active ingredient (PAR-a) on fish. Therefore, the short-term exposure effects of PAR-c and PAR-a were assessed on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae to determine the most toxic formulation [through median lethal (LC50) and effective concentrations (EC50)]. PAR-c and PAR-a induced morphological abnormalities (scoliosis) in a dose-dependent manner from 96 hours post-fertilization onwards, suggesting the involvement of a fully functional biotransformation system. As PAR-c exhibited higher toxicity, it was selected to be tested in the subsequent stage (juvenile stage), which was more sensitive (lower LC50). PAR-c significantly decreased fish swimming activity and disrupted fish stress response. Overall, the results highlight the ability of PAR-c to adversely affect fish swimming performance, an effect that persisted even after exposure ceases (21-day depuration), suggesting that PAR-c may impair individual fitness. © 2023 The Authors",Science of the Total Environment,900,NA,NA,Normal

Therefore, designing a precise regulating strategy to balance the toxicity and bioactivity of MCs is urgently needed. Here, we prepared a series of pyraclostrobin-loaded MCs with different wall materials, particle sizes, core density and shell compactness using interfacial polymerization. The results showed that the MCs released more slowly in water with increasing particle sizes and capsule compactness, and they sunk more quickly with the increasing particle sizes and core density. Additionally, MCs with slower release speed was always accompanied with lower acute toxicity levels to zebrafish. When the release dynamics slowed down to the threshold dose on demand for disease control, facilitating settlement of MCs can further reduce toxicity within spatial and temporal dimensions. The poor accumulation of MCs with larger particle sizes or dense shell in gills was closely related to their efficient detoxification. Importantly, seven of the MCs samples possessed superior selectivity between bio-performance in controlling rice blast and toxicological hazard to fish compared to commercial formulations.

Here, we use early stages of zebrafish to evaluate glyphosate as pure active ingredient and within a commercial formulation in terms of oxidative stress. Biomarkers involved in the oxidative status were evaluated along with other markers of neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, energy balance and motor performance, and the selected tools were evaluated by its sensitivity in determining early-warning events. Zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate active ingredient and glyphosate-based formulation were under oxidative stress, but only the commercial formulation delayed the embryogenesis, affected the cholinergic neurotransmission and induced DNA damage. Both altered the motor performance of larvae at very low concentrations, becoming larvae hypoactive. The energy balance was also impaired, as embryos under oxidative stress had lower lipids reserves. Although data suggest that glyphosate-based formulation has higher toxicity than the active ingredient itself, the most sensitive biomarkers detected early-warning effects at very low concentrations of the active ingredient. Biochemical biomarkers of defense system and oxidative damage were the most sensitive tools, detecting pro-oxidant responses at very low concentrations, along with markers of motor performance that showed high sensitivity and high throughput, suitable for detecting early effects linked to neurotoxicity. Alterations on morphology during embryogenesis showed the lowest sensitivity, thus morphological alterations appeared after several alterations at biochemical levels. Tools evaluating DNA damage and cell proliferation showed mid-sensitivity, but low throughput, thus they could be used as complementary markers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,916,NA,NA,Normal

Since the development of 2,4-D resistant transgenic crops, it has been described as one of the most widely distributed pollutants in the world, increasing concern about its environmental impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the antioxidant system response in animals exposed to 2,4-D by different routes of exposure. It focused on determining if tissue, phylogenetic group, and herbicide formulation would influence the antioxidant mechanisms. A careful literature search of Scopus, WoS, and Science Direct retrieved 6983, 24,098, and 20,616 articles, respectively. The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses. In summary, orally exposed animals exhibited a clear decrease in enzyme activities, transgenerational exposure elicited tissue-specific prompted biochemical reductions, and topical exposure induced increased responses, emphasizing the need for unbiased exploration of the effects of 2,4-D on biomarkers of oxidative stress while addressing publication bias in oral and topical datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,924,NA,NA,Meta

Pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represents a threat to non-target organisms, with various damages already reported in different species. However, there is controversy in studies on atrazine. The question of whether atrazine increases animal mortality is not yet clearly resolved. In this context, this study aimed to carry out a meta-analytic review, focusing on studies on environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine to evaluate its lethal effects on various animal species. We identified and analyzed 107 datasets through a selection process that used the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. A significant increase in the mortality rate of animals exposed to environmental concentrations of atrazine was observed. Nematodes, amphibians, molluscs, insects, and fish showed increased mortality after exposure to atrazine. Animals in the larval and juvenile stages showed greater susceptibility when exposed to different concentrations of atrazine. Furthermore, both commercial and pure formulations resulted in high mortality rates for exposed animals. Atrazine and other pesticides had a synergistic effect, increasing the risk of mortality in animals. There are still many gaps to be filled, and this study can serve as a basis for future regulations involving atrazine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,951,NA,NA,Meta

Given its several benefits, FIP is widely used in the agricultural and veterinary medicine fields, but its indiscriminate use can have ecotoxic effects on non-target species. Thus, the current study aimed to summarise and critically analyse FIP's ecotoxicity in aquatic animals. Data referring to bibliometric parameters (publication year and geographical distribution), experimental conditions (field and laboratory, FIP type, animal class, species, habitat, and exposure conditions), and biomarkers (oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurotoxicity, and morphological changes) were summarised and critically analysed. Ecotoxicological studies were mainly conducted with insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Exposure to pure FIP or FIP-based commercial formulation can induce mortality and have sublethal effects on non-target organisms, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage, genotoxicity (DNA damage), neurotoxicity, and morphological changes. The herein reviewed data have evidenced high median lethal FIP concentration (LC50) in vertebrates in comparison to invertebrates. The current findings confirmed that FIP can have several effects on aquatic organisms, besides suggesting potential ecotoxicological risks posed by this insecticide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Science of the Total Environment,954,NA,NA,Meta

Quantifying the associated health risk highlights the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into inhalation exposure assessments rather than using the total inhaled concentration of airborne pesticides. In this study, we measured the inhalation unit exposure (UE) of three typical pesticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid) during application and post-application drift at the recommended application dosage. The UE values were found to be 1.74–424.37 ng/m3 and 0.07–1.40 ng/m3, respectively, with marked variation between different spraying nozzles and formulations. For the inhalation exposure assessment, an in vitro method was developed to determine the inhalation bioaccessibility of lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid and its applicability was validated based on in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) analysis. Their conservative inhalation bioaccessibility values estimates were 46.09 %, 67.12 %, and 40.31 %, respectively. The calculated average daily dose values of the analyzed pesticides in both single and mixed formulations ranged from 8.03 × 10−8 to 4.35 × 10−5 mg/kg·day based on the bioaccessible UE, corresponding to 22.99–67.11 % of the total exposure.

This study aimed to investigate the toxicological effects of this molecule on isolated rat liver mitochondria, evaluating both isolated and formulated 2,4-D to comprehend the differential impacts on mitochondrial function. Our investigations did not reveal significant induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial swelling or impacts on mitochondrial respiration; however, exposure to both forms of 2,4-D affected mitochondrial membrane integrity and function in a concentration-dependent manner, notably impacting mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential. Comparatively, the formulated product showed toxicity at lower concentrations regarding interaction with membranes and ATP levels (from 0.4 μM on) and isolated 2,4-D showed toxicity at lower concentrations regarding membrane potential dissipation (from 10 μM on). Notably, the effects on ATP levels and membrane fluidity suggest interactions within the mitochondrial lipid bilayer. The findings highlight that excipients in the commercial formulation of 2,4-D potentially alter its effects, underlining the importance of evaluating not only active ingredients but also formulations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Toxicology in Vitro,104,NA,NA,Normal

This is in stark contrast to the situation for active substances where the mandatory data set comprises a most comprehensive set of studies. While the combination of certain active ingredients and co-formulants may nevertheless result in increased toxicity of the final product such combinations have never been evaluated systematically for complex and long-term toxicological endpoints. We therefore investigated the effect of three frequently used co-formulants on the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic of the representative active substance combination of tebuconazol (Teb) and prothioconazol (Pro) or of cypermethrin (Cpm) and piperonyl butoxide (Pip), respectively. With all four active substances being potential liver steatogens, cytotoxicity and triglyceride accumulation in HepaRG were used as primary endpoints. Concomitantly transcriptomics and biochemical studies were applied to interrogate for effects on gene expression or inhibition of CYP3A4 as key enzyme for functionalization. Some of the tested combinations clearly showed more than additive effects, partly due to CYP3A4 enzyme inhibition. Other effects comprised the modulation of the expression and activity of steatosis-related nuclear key receptors. Altogether, the findings highlight the need for a more systematic consideration of toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic mixture effects during assessment of PPPs. © 2023 The Authors",Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,141,NA,NA,Normal

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the response of soybean, cotton, and tobacco plants exposed to vapors of 2,4-D and dicamba formulations alone or mixed in humidomes for 24 h. Humidome studies were conducted in an open pavilion at the Lake Wheeler Turfgrass Field Lab of the North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. Dicamba and mixture treatments injured and caused a reduction in the height of soybean. Injury varied from 55% to 70%, and average plant height was 8.8 cm shorter compared with untreated control plants. Treatments with 2,4-D caused the least injury to soybean (<= 21%), and differences among formulations were identified (dimethylamine > choline > dimethylamine-monomethylamine). However, soybean height was not affected by 2,4-D treatments. No differences between treatments were observed when herbicides were applied to cotton. The greatest injury to tobacco (23.3%) was caused by dicamba dimethylamine. Overall, the effect of 2,4-D and dicamba vapor was species-specific and formulation-dependent.

However, the size effect of nanopesticides remains unclear, and its underlying mechanisms of influence have become a major obstacle in the design and application of pesticide nanoformulations. In this research, the noncarrier-coated emamectin benzoate (EB) solid dispersions (Micro-EB and Nano-EB) were produced under a constant surfactant-to-active ingredient ratio by a self-emulsifying-carrier solidification technique. The particle size of Micro-EB was 162 times that of spherical Nano-EB. The small size and large specific surface area of Nano-EB facilitated the adsorption of surfactants on the surface of the particles, thereby improving its dispersibility, suspensibility, and stability. The pinning effect of nanoparticles significantly suppressed droplet retraction and rebounding. Moreover, Nano-EB exhibited a 25% higher retention of the active ingredient on cabbage leaves and a 70% higher washing resistance than Micro-EB, and both were significantly different. The improvement of abilities in wetting, spreading, and retention of Nano-EB on crop leaves contributed to the increase in foliar utilization, which further resulted in a 1.6-fold enhancement of bioactivity against target Spodoptera exigua compared to Micro-EB. Especially, Nano-EB did not exacerbate the safety risk to the nontarget organism zebrafish with no significant difference. This study elaborates the size effect on the effectiveness and safety of pesticide formulations and lays a theoretical foundation for the development and rational utilization of efficient and environmentally friendly nanopesticides. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces,16,22558,22570,Nano

The nanodelivery system showed the prolonged effectivity of EB with reduced degradation and demonstrated a good control efficacy for multiple target pests, such as red spider mite, beet armyworm larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and rice stem borers (Chilo suppressalis). Toxicology tests on various objects demonstrated that the EBWNS has low toxicity for seeds, HaCaT cells, zebrafish, earthworm, and E. coli.

Herein, a multi-stimuli-responsive nano/microcapsule bidirectional delivery system loaded with pyraclostrobin (Pyr) is prepared through interfacial cross-linking from a lignin-based Pickering emulsion template. During this process, methacrylated alkali lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are utilized as stabilizers for the tunable oil-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion. Subsequently, a thiol-ene radical reaction occurs with the acid-labile cross-linkers at the oil-water interface, leading to the formation of lignin nano/microcapsules (LNCs) with various topological shapes. Through the investigation of the polymerization process and the structure of LNC, it was found that the amphiphilicity-driven diffusion and distribution of cyclohexanone impact the topology of LNC. The obtained Pyr@LNC exhibits high encapsulation efficiency, tunable size, and excellent UV shielding to Pyr. Additionally, the flexible topology of the Pyr@LNC shell enhances the retention and adhesion of the foliar surface. Furthermore, Pyr@LNC exhibits pH/laccase-responsive targeting against Botrytis disease, enabling the intelligent release of Pyr. The in vivo fungicidal activity shows that efficacy of Pyr@LNC is 53% ± 2% at 14 days postspraying, whereas the effectiveness of Pyr suspension concentrate is only 29% ± 4%, and the acute toxicity of Pyr@LNC to zebrafish is reduced by more than 9-fold compared with that of Pyr technical. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that the LNCs can be bidirectionally translocated in plants.

In line with this objective, we present green preparation of a colloidal pesticide formulation using optimized lysine-derived carbon dots (LysCDs)-modified CaCO3 (LysCDs/CaCO3) particles as the carrier and abamectin (Abm) as the active ingredient. The loading capacity of abamectin in this colloidal pesticide (LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm) is 1.7 to 2.1 times higher than that of its counterpart (CaCO3/Abm) prepared without LysCDs, which is attributed to the increased specific surface area and pore volume of LysCDs/CaCO3 particles. Due to the acid-induced degradation of CaCO3, the release of abamectin for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm is accelerated under weakly acidic conditions, which is accompanied by the release of Ca2+ ions and the fluorescence changes of LysCDs. The incorporation of LysCDs enhances the photostability and foliar adhesiveness of this colloidal pesticide, resulting in the highest degree of foliar retention when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or rainfall, compared to free-form abamectin and CaCO3/Abm. This results in the best performance of pest control on Plutella xylostella for LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm in both indoor and outdoor tests. Nontarget biocompatibility evaluations show that LysCDs/CaCO3/Abm exhibits lower acute toxicity to zebrafish and earthworms than free-form abamectin. In addition, this colloidal pesticide is favored by the minimal residue of the adjuvant material after abamectin release, which is converted into harmless Ca2+ ions, CO2, and LysCDs. Therefore, this work designs a safer and more effective colloidal pesticide formulation to deliver abamectin with minimal adjuvant residue, realizing its trajectory as basically ""circular and green"".",ACS NANO,19,1007,1025,Nano

Although adjuvants are generally considered to be biologically inert, some adjuvants have exhibited toxicity and sublethal effects, including decreasing survival rates of next-generation queens. Honey bees have a highly developed olfactory system to detect and discriminate among social signals. To investigate the impact of pesticide-adjuvant combinations on honey bee signal perception, we performed electroantennography assays to assess alterations in their olfactory responsiveness to the brood ester pheromone (BEP), the volatile larval pheromone β-ocimene, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. These assays aimed to uncover potential mechanisms underlying changes in social behaviors and reduced brood survival after pesticide exposure. We found that combining the adjuvant Dyne-Amic with the fungicide Tilt (propiconazole) and the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole) synergistically enhanced olfactory responses to three concentrations of BEP and as well exerted dampening and compensatory effects on responses to 2-heptanone and β-ocimene, respectively. In contrast, exposure to adjuvant alone or the combination of fungicide and insecticide had no effect on olfactory responses to BEP at most concentrations but altered responses to β-ocimene and 2-heptanone. Exposure to Dyne-Amic, Altacor, and Tilt increased BEP signal amplitude, indicating potential changes in olfactory receptor sensitivity or sensilla permeability to odorants. Given that, in a previous study, next-generation queens raised by nurses exposed to the same treated pollen experienced reduced survival, these new findings highlight the potential disruption of social signaling in honey bees and its implications for colony reproductive success. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",Scientific Reports,13,NA,NA,Normal

While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients.

However, these emerging nanopesticides need a thorough evaluation compared to current formulations to determine whether their “nano” properties intensify toxicity for non-target organisms. This study assessed the lethal toxicity of three nanopesticides on Daphnia magna. The nanopesticides tested were tebuconazole loaded onto poly-ϵ-caprolactone, nanostructured lipid carriers, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles. Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers. The observed toxicity levels, from highest to lowest, were as follows: pure tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on nanostructured lipid carriers > commercial tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles > tebuconazole-loaded on poly-ϵ-caprolactone. The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling.

European regulatory authorities are reticent to allow extrapolation of study data to different scenarios as the contributory factors have hitherto been poorly identified. This study is the first to use a new laboratory DFR method to investigate how one such factor, pesticide formulation, may affect DFR on a variety of crops. The study used the active substance difenoconazole as both an emulsifiable concentrate (EC 10%) and a wettable powder (WP 10%) with and without adjuvants (Tween 20 and organophosphate tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate TEHP) on tomato, French bean and oilseed rape. A comparable DFR% was retained from the WP and EC formulation on most crops except for tomato, where lower DFR% was retained in the case of WP (39 ± 4.7%) compared to EC (60 ± 1.2%). No significant effect of adjuvant addition was observed for either formulation except when mixing TEHP (0.1% w/v) to the EC 10% on French bean, resulting in 8% DFR reduction compared to the EC formulation alone. This research demonstrates the value of a unique DFR laboratory technique in investigating the importance of the formulation and in-tank adjuvants as factors that affect DFR. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part B Pesticides, Food Contaminants, and Agricultural Wastes",59,437,447,Normal

These studies were undertaken to provide important new information about the potential for the enhanced neurotoxicity of herbicides following nasal inhalation. Materials and Methods: Transport of atrazine from aqueous solution and from commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products was assessed using excised nasal mucosal tissues. The permeation rate and the role of membrane transporters in the uptake of atrazine across the nasal mucosa were also investigated. Histological examination of the nasal tissues was conducted to assess the effects of commercial atrazine-containing products on nasal tissue morphology. Results: Atrazine showed high flux across both nasal respiratory and olfactory tissues, and efflux transporters were found to play an essential role in limiting its uptake at low exposure concentrations. Commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products showed remarkably high transfer across the nasal tissues, and histological evaluation showed significant changes in the morphology of the nasal epithelium following exposure to the herbicide products. Discussion: Lipophilic herbicides such as atrazine can freely permeate across the nasal mucosa despite the activity of efflux transporters. The adjuvant compounds in commercial herbicide products disrupt the nasal mucosa’s epithelial barrier, resulting in even greater atrazine permeation across the tissues. The properties of the herbicide itself and those of the formulated products play crucial roles in the potential for the enhanced neurotoxicity of herbicides following nasal inhalation. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Inhalation Toxicology,36,250,260,Normal

While safeners are typically structurally similar to their co-formulated herbicides, they are classified as ""inert"" in the United States, meaning they are not held to the same regulatory standards as the herbicides. This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment. Regulatory agencies should consider reclassifying safeners as active ingredients to ensure adequate toxicity testing and risk assessment. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Critical Reviews in Toxicology,54,805,855,Review

In this analysis, we summarize the results of studies of toxicity of SFX to pollinators conducted registrant as well as results published in the literature. The geometric mean of 48-hr adult acute oral LD50 values for SFX for honeybees was 0.0740 μg SFX bee− 1 (n = 5). Toxicity values for technical grade SFX (SFX-T) and formulated products were not significantly different. The geometric mean 48 hr adult acute contact LD50 values for SFX-T and several formulated products were 0.432 (n = 2) and 0.202 (n = 3) μg SFX bee− 1, respectively. Exposures sprayed foliage was not significant after the spray had dried did not cause significant toxicity. Transformation products were not significantly toxic to adult or larval honeybees or other representative bee species. Results showed that, to complete the risk assessment, higher-tier studies were required.

10.1093/jisesa/iead100,1,1,2,Review: The risks of spray adjuvants to honey bees,455,Shannon B.; Jeon H.; Johnson R.M.,2023,"Pesticide applications are often made as tank mixes containing multiple pesticide products and may include spray adjuvants to enhance pesticidal activities. The primary aim of adjuvant products is to increase the spreading and sticking of spray droplets and to increase the penetration of active ingredients through the cuticles of leaves or targeted pests, which can reduce the amount of active ingredient needed for effective pest control. Adjuvants are made up of compounds drawn from the ""inert ingredient""list maintained by EPA but are identified as ""principal functioning agents""when used in adjuvant products. These inert compounds do not undergo the same testing and risk assessment process that is required of pesticide active ingredients and generally have no mitigation measures that prevent application onto crops during bloom at times of day when bees are foraging. Honey bees (Apis mellifera;Hymenoptera:Apidae) are at an increased risk of exposure to adjuvant tank mixtures while providing agricultural pollination services. Colony losses attributed to pesticide applications thought to have low risk to honey bees have been reported, highlighting the need to better understand the toxicity of adjuvants included in pesticide tank mixtures. This review summarizes current literature on the risks posed to honey bees by agricultural adjuvants and tank mix combinations of adjuvants with pesticides. Based on the current state of knowledge, we make recommendations to pesticide applicators, product manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and researchers regarding adjuvant toxicity to honey bees with the goal of reducing risks that adjuvants pose to honey bees and other beneficial insects.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Combinations of Theia and strategic concentrations of two demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides were investigated to explore potential synergisms. Bacteria were cultured in nutrient broth and combined with technical grades and two formulations of propiconazole (emulsifiable concentrate [EC] and wettable powder) and metconazole (EC and water-dispersible granule) at 0, 10, 50, 100, and 150 µg/ml of active ingredient. After cocultivation, the optical density (OD600) and colony forming units (CFU/ml) were evaluated. In contrast to EC formulations, the wettable powder or water-dispersible granule formulations at 10 or 50 µg/ml of both DMIs did not affect vegetative cell growth. The mixture of Theia and each formulated DMI at 50 µg/ml of active ingredient resulted in a significant reduction of Monilinia fructicola lesion development on apple, Colletotrichum siamense lesion development on cherry, and Botrytis cinerea lesion development on cherry. The combination of Theia with EC formulations showed weaker disease reduction due to antagonism. Only Theia plus non-EC formulated propiconazole and metconazole significantly reduced brown rot disease incidence of apple compared with the respective solo treatments and anthracnose disease incidence of cherry compared with the untreated control. Our results indicated that at least some DMI fungicides possess bactericidal effects depending on the formulation and concentration. The combination of Theia with a lower-than-label-rate concentration (50 µg/ml) of the DMI fungicides propiconazole and metconazole showed potential for synergistic effects, especially when non-EC formulations were used. © 2024 The American Phytopathological Society.",Phytopathology,114,1515,1524,Normal

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world's most used pesticides, but until recent years they have been claimed to be safe for non-target organisms, such as pollinators. Using controlled arena experiments, we investigated the effects on the learning and long-term memory of buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), of a single field-realistic dose of glyphosate, both in its pure form and as a commercial herbicide (Roundup Gold) containing the active ingredient (a.i.) glyphosate and other co-formulants. We found that glyphosate in its pure form caused deterioration in the learning ability of bumblebees in a 10-color discrimination experiment; the glyphosate-treated bees discriminated colors over 10% worse than the untreated control bees. However, the commercially used GBH (Roundup Gold) had no observable effect on the learning ability of the bumblebees, despite the fact that this herbicide contained the same amount of glyphosate as its pure form. These findings shed light on the potential risks associated with agrochemicals previously considered safe for pollinators and emphasize the need for comprehensive risk assessments of pesticides, including evaluations of cognitive functions in pollinators. Therefore, we propose that future pesticide testing should incorporate broader assessments to ensure the safety of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1111/plb.13577,2,0,2,Effects of macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics on seed germination of temperate grassland species,1088,Laber L.; Eichberg C.; Zimmerbeutel A.; Düring R.-A.; Donath T.W.,2023,"Macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics are widely used to control invertebrate pests in livestock, such as sheep. While anthelmintic effects on non-target animals, such as dung-dwelling insects, are well studied, effects on seed germination are largely unknown. Seeds can come into contact with anthelmintics either during passage through the gastro-intestinal tract of grazing animals or when anthelmintics are excreted with their dung into the environment, which may result in changed germination patterns. We used four commonly applied macrocyclic lactones to assess their effects on germination: moxidectin, ivermectin, abamectin and doramectin as pure substances; moxidectin and ivermectin also in formulated form. We tested these pharmaceuticals on 17 different temperate grassland species from five plant families. Seeds were exposed to three concentrations of macrocyclic lactones (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg·l−1) under controlled conditions, and germination was assessed over a 6-week period. From these data, we calculated germination percentage, mean germination time and germination synchrony. Most of the tested species were significantly affected in germination percentage and/or mean germination time by at least one of the tested pharmaceuticals, with formulated moxidectin having the largest impact. In general, the effects found were species- and pharmaceutical-specific. While formulated substances generally reduced germination percentage and increased mean germination time, pure substances increased germination percentage. Synchrony showed less clear patterns in all pharmaceuticals. Although effect size and sign varied between species, our study shows that non-target effects of macrocyclic lactones commonly occur in terrestrial plants. This may impede successful seed exchange between habitats via sheep, and even translate into profound changes to grazed ecosystems. © 2023 The Authors.

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called “inert” co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable. © 2023, The Author(s).",Environmental Sciences Europe,35,NA,NA,Review

Globally, more than 2000 commercial GLY-based herbicides (GBHs) are used to control weeds. Non-target organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real environmental conditions, but the co-formulants contained in GBHs are classified as so-called inert and inactive ingredients in terms of their biological effects. The main objective of this comprehensive review is to compile the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies on the side-effects of GLY, GBHs, and their formulating agents. Based on the results demonstrated for a variety of plant and animal aquatic organisms, oxidative stress appears to be a major trigger for these adverse effects, affecting the integrity of DNA and other biochemical functions. Furthermore, there is evidence of impairment of various physiological and behavioral functions. Adverse effects of GLY and GBHs have been observed even at very low concentrations. There are also differences in the sensitivity of the aquatic organisms tested, even with similar lifestyles, habitats or identical taxa. The studies typically investigate the short-term effects of a single exposure to GLY/GBH on a single species, whilst in reality multiple applications of GBHs together with other pesticides are common during a cropping cycle. Moreover, the interactions between GLY/GBHs and other aquatic contaminants are rarely studied. Higher toxicity of GBHs compared to GLY alone has often been observed, demonstrating that co-formulants can be highly toxic on their own and markedly increase the toxicity of the GBH formulation. The possible impurities in GBHs, such as heavy metals, can cause additional problems for the environment and food safety. The widespread and massive use of GBHs leads to increased exposure and environmental hazards. In addition, the need for a revision of the risk assessment system is emphasized. According to the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies, the current use and pollution of the aquatic environment by GLY/GBHs is highly problematic and cannot be considered environmentally sustainable. It is, therefore, necessary to at least tighten the permitted forms of use. © The Author(s) 2024.",Environmental Sciences Europe,36,NA,NA,Review

Nevertheless, glyphosate has been shown to bioaccumulate in the tissues of several organisms. To understand the bioconcentration dynamics of glyphosate in fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta forma fario) of different age were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, the formulation Roundup® LB Plus, and the major transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) for two, three, or four weeks at different temperatures in the laboratory. Mortality rates were determined, and tissue samples were collected at the end of the experiment to ascertain concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA residues by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Results: Brown trout mortality during exposure to glyphosate or AMPA was considerably higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C. Also, a significant increase in glyphosate concentrations in samples containing muscle, head, backbone, and caudal fin tissue with increasing exposure concentrations and temperatures was observed. Six-month-old fish contained more glyphosate per kg wet weight after exposure than ten-month-old fish. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for glyphosate and AMPA were much higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C, but in both cases decreased with higher glyphosate concentrations. The BCF for glyphosate formulated in Roundup® was higher than the one for the parent compound. Approximately 30–42% of the organ-absorbed glyphosate and AMPA remained in the tissues even when the fish were kept in clean water lacking the test substances for three weeks after termination of exposure. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that there is an interaction between glyphosate and ambient temperature in terms of toxicity. Further it was shown that increasing concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the surrounding media lead to significantly increased concentrations of these substances in brown trout tissues, although neither bioconcentration nor bioaccumulation of glyphosate in animal tissues is expected due to the high water solubility of this chemical. As a consequence, the uptake of glyphosate by humans through the consumption of contaminated edible fish is very likely. © The Author(s) 2024.",Environmental Sciences Europe,36,NA,NA,Normal

Nanoformulations of pesticides are being developed as potential alternatives due to their beneficial properties, including enhanced solubility, targeted delivery to the site of action, improved stability and efficacy and reduced non-target effects. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment is necessary for these emerging nanopesticides compared to existing formulations, aiming to ascertain whether their ""nano"" characteristics exacerbate toxicity for non-target organisms. This study investigated the toxicity of tebuconazole (TBZ) in different formulations, including nanoformulations (poly-ε-caprolactone [PCL] and nanostructured lipid carrier [NLC] loaded with TBZ), as well as a commercial formulation, on the reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in both aqueous and soil matrices. Additionally, the impact of the correspondent nanocarriers without TBZ on C. elegans was examined. In water, TBZ in the form of nano and commercial formulations exhibited higher toxicity on the nematodes' reproduction than the TBZ (a.s.) attributable to higher freely dissolved concentrations of TBZ, which resulted in a toxicity order, ranging from the most to the least toxic as follows: NLC-TBZ > PCL-TBZ > commercial formulation > TBZ (a.s.). For NLC-TBZ, the excess toxicity could be clearly explained by combined toxicity of TBZ (a.s.) and nanocarriers, with the effect addition of the separate single compounds matching the observed effects of the nanoformulation. For PCL-TBZ, effects were stronger than expected from the effect addition of TBZ (a.s.) and PCL nanocarriers, potentially due to enhanced bioavailability of encapsulated TBZ in the gut of the nematodes. In soil, NLC with and without loaded TBZ showed higher toxicity than other tested compounds, while PCL nanocarriers without TBZ did not exhibit negative effects on the reproduction of C. elegans. Microcosm experiment, where long-term effects on native soil nematode fauna were tested, confirmed that TBZ-nanoformulations act via combined toxic effects of TBZ and nanocarriers. These findings contribute valuable insights to understanding nanopesticides' ecotoxicity and underscore the need for harmonized regulatory assessments to evaluate these novel formulations adequately. © The Author(s) 2024.",Environmental Sciences Europe,36,NA,NA,Normal/Nano

The near ubiquitous use of the broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate, in farming operations globally has necessitated a more expansive evaluation of the impacts of the agent itself and formulations containing glyphosate on important components of the plant phyllosphere, including Methylobacterium. This study provides an investigation of the sensitivity of 18 strains of Methylobacterium to glyphosate and two commercially available glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH). Nearly all strains of Methylobacterium showed signs of sensitivity to the popular GBH formulations WeatherMax® and Transorb® in a modified Kirby Bauer experiment. However, exposure to pure forms of glyphosate did not show a significant effect on growth for any strain in both the Kirby Bauer test and in liquid broth, until polysorbate-20 (Tween20) was added as a surfactant. Artificially increasing membrane permeability through the introduction of polysorbate-20 caused a 78–84% reduction in bacterial cell biomass relative to controls containing glyphosate or high levels of surfactant only (0–9% and 6–37% reduction respectively). Concentrations of glyphosate as low as 0.05% w/v (500 µg/L) from both commercial formulations tested, inhibited the culturability of Methylobacterium on fresh nutrient-rich medium.

Most commercial compound formulations are open systems with non-adjustable released rates, resulting in a high frequency of applications. Meanwhile, although nano pesticide delivery systems constructed with different carrier materials have been extensively studied, realizing their actual scale-up production still has important practical significance due to the large-scale field application. In this study, a boscalid and pyraclostrobin dual-loaded nano pesticide system (BPDN) was constructed with industrial-grade carrier materials to facilitate the realization of large-scale production. The optimal industrial-scale preparation mechanism of BPDN was studied with surfactants as key factors. When agricultural emulsifier No.600 and polycarboxylate are used as the ratio of 1:2 in the preparation process, the BPDN has a spherical structure with an average size of 270 nm and exhibits superior physical stability. Compared with commercial formulation, BPDN maintains rate-stabilized release up to 5 times longer, exhibits better dispersion and spreading performance on foliar, has more than 20% higher deposition amounts, and reduces loss. A single application of BPDN could efficiently control tomato gray mold during the growing period of tomatoes due to extended duration and combinatory effectiveness, reducing two application times and labor costs. Toxicology tests on various objects systematically demonstrated that BPDN has improved safety for HepG2 cells, and nontarget organism earthworms.

The apiary area was divided into three groups: control, commercial formulation containing IMD (Evidence® 700WG) (IMDCF), and IMD active ingredient (Sigma–Aldrich) (IMDAI). Treatment groups were fed syrup containing 1 µg L−1 IMD, whereas the control group was fed syrup only. Compared with the control, larvae exposed to IMDCF or IMDAI for 42 days exhibited morphological changes in the external body, midgut, and fat body. The midgut of adult bees contaminated with IMDCF showed only structural remnants of the peritrophic membrane and absence of regenerative cell nests. Oxidative stress analyses revealed that IMDCF-exposed larvae had higher nitrite and carbonylated protein contents and lower catalase and superoxide dismutase activity than control individuals. In pupae, IMDAI decreased catalase activity while increasing superoxide dismutase activity. These findings indicate that IMD has the potential to significantly impact the development of bees and their colonies by disrupting vital organs responsible for normal physiological functioning and overall activities of individuals. Oxidative stress, which was detected at different stages of bee development, may induce lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation, leading to cell death. © The Author(s) 2024.",Biological Research,58,NA,NA,Normal

As they are not designed to target insects, the mechanisms behind potential impacts of these pesticides are unclear. It is therefore important to understand their influence at a range of levels, including sublethal impacts on behaviours such as learning. We used the proboscis extension reflex (PER) paradigm to assess how the herbicide glyphosate and the fungicide prothioconazole affect bumblebee olfactory learning. We also assessed responsiveness, and compared the impacts of these active ingredients and their respective commercial formulations (Roundup Biactive and Proline). We found that learning was not impaired by either formulation but, of the bees that displayed evidence of learning, exposure to prothioconazole active ingredient increased learning level in some situations, while exposure to glyphosate active ingredient resulted in bumblebees being less likely to respond to antennal stimulation with sucrose. Our data suggest that fungicides and herbicides may not negatively impact olfactory learning ability when bumblebees are exposed orally to field-realistic doses in a lab setting, but that glyphosate has the potential to cause changes in responsiveness in bees. As we found impacts of active ingredients and not commercial formulations, this suggests that co-formulants may modify impacts of active ingredients in the products tested on olfactory learning without being toxic themselves. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, and to evaluate the implications of behavioural changes caused by glyphosate and prothioconazole for bumblebee fitness. © 2023.

Three mycoinsecticide formulations (SS6, SS7, and SS8) with dispersing and wetting agents were developed as wettable powder formulations in this trial. SS8 demonstrated the best wettability, suspensibility, and dispersibility with viability at 107 (CFU)/mL even after three months of storage. However, SS7 developed with C. fumosorosea as an active ingredient was found to effectively reduce the bagworm population by more than 95%. The application of all mycoinsecticide formulations in the infested oil palm area was able to reduce the M. plana population by more than 95%, 30 DAT. The formulations also show no significant increase in mortality of the oil palm pollinator, Elaeidobius kamerunicus. This finding indicates that the C. fumosorosea tested has potential for managing bagworms without harming pollinators on oil palm plantations. © Pesticide Science Society of Japan 2023.

Their mode of action is based on blocking the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme which exists in all species with mitochondria. SDH is involved in two interconnected metabolic processes for energy production: cellular respiration, where it enables the transfer of electrons in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the Krebs cycle, where it catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. In humans, inherited SDH deficiencies can induce encephalopathies and cancers. The cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the genetic inactivation of SDH have been well described in tumours, where it causes an oxidative stress, a pseudohypoxia phenotype, a metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptomic remodelling, and alterations in migration and invasion capacities of cancer cells, related to the accumulation of an oncometabolite, the succinate, following SDH inactivation. The use of SDHi fungicides has raised many questions in recent years. Their mode of action, which aims at altering mitochondrial functions essential for energy production and metabolic homeostasis, is not specific to fungi, suggesting that they could also be toxic to humans and biodiversity. The impact of SDHis on health remains largely unexplored to date on exposure and impregnation on farmers and the general population. In addition, the physicochemical properties of SDHis make them potentially persistent in soils and organisms, and a growing number of studies report toxic effects of SDHis in non -target species. The analysis of regulatory assessment reports shows that most SDHi substances induce tumours in animals, with no evidence of genotoxicity. Thus, for these substances, the mechanism of carcinogenicity have not yet been clearly established and elucidation would require developing regulatory evaluation procedures by better integrating the knowledges on carcinogenesis processes acquired over the last ten years.",ENVIRONNEMENT RISQUES & SANTE,23,7,20,Review

Despite the use of various genetic assessment criteria and testing systems to investigate amitraz poisoning, studies have yielded diverse and inconclusive results. This study aimed to analyze the genotoxic potential of the insecticide amitraz and compare the effects of the active constituent and a commercial product containing amitraz. Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured during one cellular cycle in Ham F12 medium containing 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 µg mL-1 of amitraz. Quantitative comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay were employed to evaluate the potential genotoxic effect. All genotoxicity parameters evaluated clearly demonstrated the capability of the commercial amitraz formulation to negatively affect DNA, inducing both cytogenetic and cytomolecular damage. After culturing the cells with the active component of the formula, only a slight, non-significant increase in damage was found. Since our findings showed that the active component of the formula is not the sole responsible for the genotoxic effect of the commercial product, we emphasize the importance of considering the adverse effects of the solvents used in commercial pesticide formulations. © 2025 Universidad Nacional de Nordeste (UNNE).

These diseases lead to considerable losses. Seed coating technology effectively protects rice from these diseases and mitigates environmental pollution. We determined the antifungal activity of six fungicides, including phenamacril, azoxystrobin, fludioxonil, metconazole, thifluzamide and prothioconazole against Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon and Curvularia lunata in this study. In addition, the impact of fungicides and surfactants on rice seed germination were determined. Furthermore, phenamacril and fludioxonil were selected as the active components of suspension concentrate for seed coating. The antifungal activity of phenamacril against F. moniliforme Sheldon was 0.139 mg/L and fludioxonil against C. lunata was 0.110 mg/L. PEG-2000 was selected as the surfactant due to its promoting effect on rice seedling. Based on the above findings, 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS was developed via the wet sand grinding method. The toxicity of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS to zebrafish was verified, and field experiments were conducted in five different regions of the Yangtze River Basin. The results indicated minimal toxicity of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS to zebrafish. Relative to the control agent consisting of 6.25% phenamacril metalaxyl-M FS, 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS showed better control effect and exhibited superior efficacy in promoting growth and increasing yield in all five regions. Specifically, the control effect of 6% phenamacril fludioxonil FS on bakanae exceeded 84.83% with the highest yield increasing value recorded at 30.48%. Currently, the market offers a limited selection of suspension concentrate for seed coating of rice.

10.3389/ftox.2023.1200881,2,0,2,Comparative toxicity assessment of glyphosate and two commercial formulations in the planarian Dugesia japonica,582,Fuselier S.G.; Ireland D.; Fu N.; Rabeler C.; Collins E.-M.S.,2023,"Introduction: Glyphosate is a widely used, non-selective herbicide. Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are considered safe for non-target organisms and environmentally benign at currently allowed environmental exposure levels. However, their increased use in recent years has triggered questions about possible adverse outcomes due to low dose chronic exposure in animals and humans. While the toxicity of GBHs has primarily been attributed to glyphosate, other largely unstudied components of GBHs may be inherently toxic or could act synergistically with glyphosate. Thus, comparative studies of glyphosate and GBHs are needed to parse out their respective toxicity. Methods: We performed such a comparative screen using pure glyphosate and two popular GBHs at the same glyphosate acid equivalent concentrations in the freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica. This planarian has been shown to be a useful model for both ecotoxicology and neurotoxicity/developmental neurotoxicity studies. Effects on morphology and various behavioral readouts were obtained using an automated screening platform, with assessments on day 7 and day 12 of exposure. Adult and regenerating planarians were screened to allow for detection of developmentally selective effects. Results: Both GBHs were more toxic than pure glyphosate. While pure glyphosate induced lethality at 1 mM and no other effects, both GBHs induced lethality at 316 μM and sublethal behavioral effects starting at 31.6 μM in adult planarians. These data suggest that glyphosate alone is not responsible for the observed toxicity of the GBHs. Because these two GBHs also include other active ingredients, namely diquat dibromide and pelargonic acid, respectively, we tested whether these compounds were responsible for the observed effects. Screening of the equivalent concentrations of pure diquat dibromide and pure pelargonic acid revealed that the toxicity of either GBH could not be explained by the active ingredients alone. Discussion: Because all compounds induced toxicity at concentrations above allowed exposure levels, our data indicates that glyphosate/GBH exposure is not an ecotoxicological concern for D. japonica planarians. Developmentally selective effects were not observed for all compounds. Together, these data demonstrate the usefulness of high throughput screening in D. japonica planarians for assessing various types of toxicity, especially for comparative studies of several chemicals across different developmental stages.

Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission.

However, we know little about how the effects of glyphosate AIs differ from those of GBHs that also contain so-called inert co-formulants. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using the model cover crop white mustard (Sinapis alba) to investigate the effects of three GBHs (Roundup PowerFlex, Roundup LB Plus, and Touchdown Quattro) and their respective glyphosate AIs (glyphosate potassium, isopropylamine, and diammonium salt) on epedaphic springtails (Sminthurinus niger; Collembola) activity in soils with low (3.0%) or high (4.1%) organic matter content (SOM). Springtail activity was assessed using pitfall traps. Most GBHs and AIs reduced springtail activity compared to mechanical removal of mustard in the short-term and even up to 5 months after application. GBHs and AIs differed considerably in their effects on springtail activity, and effects were modified by SOM content. Our results highlight the need to (i) distinguish between the effects of glyphosate AIs and commercial GBH formulations, (ii) disclose all ingredients of GBHs, as co-formulants also affect non-target organisms, and (iii) include soil properties in ecotoxicological risk assessments for soil organisms to better characterize the situation in the field. © 2023 by the authors.",Agriculture (Switzerland),13,NA,NA,Normal

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that ""inert"" ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure. This finding suggests that pesticides produce the inhibitory effect on enzymes through other mechanisms.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,24,NA,NA,Normal

Repellents reduce the risk of housefly vector diseases. Green repellents from plant essential oils (EOs) and their active compounds were, at the time, a promising option against houseflies. This study evaluated the housefly-repellent activities of every tested EO, their main constituents, and several combinations of them. The combinations were lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) EO + trans-anethole, lemongrass EO + star anise (Illicium verum) EO, geranial + trans-anethole, and star anise EO + geranial. The efficacies of every formulation were compared against each other and DEET (a synthetic repellent). All combinations were more effective in repellency than all single-component formulations and DEET. More significantly, all of them were safe for four non-target species: guppy (Poecilia reticulata), molly (Poecilia latipinna), dwarf honeybee (Apis florea), and stingless bee (Tetragonula pagdeni). These combinations could be developed into valuable green repellents for housefly vector disease management.Abstract The present study evaluated the housefly repellency of single-component formulations and combinations of lemongrass and star anise essential oils (EOs) and their main constituents. The efficacies of the combinations were compared against those of single-component formulations and DEET. Safety bioassays of all formulations and DEET on non-target species-guppy, molly, dwarf honeybee, and stingless bee-were conducted. GC-MS analysis showed that the main constituent of lemongrass EO was geranial (46.83%) and that of star anise EO was trans-anethole (92.88%). All combinations were highly synergistic compared to single-component formulations, with an increased repellent value (IR) of 34.6 to 51.2%. The greatest synergistic effect was achieved by 1.0% lemongrass EO + 1.0% trans-anethole combination, with an IR of 51.2%. The strongest, 100% repellent rate at 6 h was achieved by 1.0% geranial + 1.0% trans-anethole. They were twice as effective as DEET and caused obvious damage to housefly antennae under microscopic observation. All single-component formulations and combinations were benign to the four tested non-target species. In contrast, DEET was highly toxic to them. The synergistic repellency and biosafety of these two combinations are compellingly strong support for developing them into an effective green repellent.",INSECTS,15,NA,NA,Normal/Bio

Using a multi-biomarker approach, we evaluated neurotoxicity, metabolic disturbances, phase II detoxification processes, and immune system function. Our findings revealed that commercial fungicide mixtures with multiple active ingredients affect bees differently than single active compounds. Biomarker responses highlighted how these complex mixtures disrupt various enzymatic pathways; including immune function; altering critical enzyme kinetics involved in detoxification and potentially impairing essential bee functions.

It damages plants by secreting large amounts of oxalic acid and cell wall-degrading enzymes. To meet this challenge, we designed a new pH/enzyme dual-responsive nanopesticide Pro@ZnO@Pectin (PZP). This nanopesticide uses zinc oxide (ZnO) as a carrier of prochloraz (Pro) and is encapsulated with pectin. When encountering oxalic acid released by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the acidic environment promotes the decomposition of ZnO; at the same time, the pectinase produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can also decompose the outer pectin layer of PZP, thereby promoting the effective release of the active ingredient. Experimental data showed that PZP was able to achieve an efficient release rate of 57.25% and 68.46% when pectinase was added or under acidic conditions, respectively. In addition, in vitro tests showed that the antifungal effect of PZP was comparable to that of the commercial Pro (Pro SC) on the market, and its efficacy was 1.40 times and 1.32 times that of the Pro original drug (Pro TC), respectively. Crucially, the application of PZP significantly alleviated the detrimental impacts of Pro on wheat development. Soil wetting experiments have proved that PZP primarily remained in the soil, thereby decreasing its likelihood of contaminating water sources and reducing potential risks to non-target organisms. Moreover, PZP improved the foliar wettability of Pro, lowering the contact angle to 75.06°. Residue analyses indicated that PZP did not elevate prochloraz residue levels in tomato fruits compared to conventional applications, indicating that the nanopesticide formulation does not lead to excessive pesticide buildup. In summary, the nanopesticide PZP shows great promise for effectively managing Sclerotinia sclerotiorum while minimizing environmental impact. © 2024 by the authors.",Nanomaterials,14,NA,NA,Nano

In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient—AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup® Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from ~20% to ~50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released ~70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use. © 2023 by the authors.",Sustainability (Switzerland),15,NA,NA,Normal

To enhance the efficacy of the active ingredient, GBHs used in practice often contain other ingredients marked as inert “adjuvants” or “co-formulants”, the toxic properties of which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of pure glyphosate, three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) and two co-formulants commonly used in GBHs as assessed via CCK-8 assay, and the extent of their potential oxidative damage as assessed via superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, in order to reveal the role of adjuvants in the toxicity of the formulations. Our results showed that glyphosate alone did not significantly affect cell viability. In contrast, GBHs and adjuvants induced a pronounced cytotoxic effect from a concentration of 100 μM. SOD activity of cells treated with GBHs or adjuvants was significantly lower compared to cells treated with glyphosate alone. This suggests that the adjuvants in GBHs are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the formulations through the induction of oxidative stress. © 2023 by the authors.",Toxics,11,NA,NA,Normal

In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole-safener-antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 +/- 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i. (EC50 = 0.02 +/- 0.00 mg/L). The Merlin Flexx formulation (EC50 = 27.04 +/- 1.41 mg/L) was found to be approximately 50-fold less toxic than Merlin WG75, which can be explained by the different chemical characteristics and quantity of additives in them. The additives influenced the dissipation of the a.i. in Z8 medium, as the DT50 value decreased by approximately 1.2- and 3.5-fold under light and dark conditions, respectively.",TOXICS,12,NA,NA,Normal

Although co-formulants in pesticide formulations were considered inactive components from the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pesticide, several studies have proven the high individual toxicity of formulating agents, as well as the enhanced combined toxicity of the active ingredients and other components. Since the majority of active ingredients are present in the form of chemical mixtures in our environment, the possible combined toxicity between active ingredients and co-formulants is particularly important. To assess the individual and combined phytotoxicity of the components, glyphosate was tested in the form of pure active ingredient (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and herbicide formulations (Roundup Classic and Medallon Premium) formulated with a mixture of polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEA) or alkyl polyglucosides (APG), respectively. The order of acute toxicity was as follows for Roundup Classic: glyphosate < herbicide formulation < POEA. However, the following order was demonstrated for Medallon Premium: herbicide formulation < glyphosate < APG. Increased photosynthetic activity was detected after the exposure to the formulation (1.5–5.8 mg glyphosate/L and 0.5–2.2 mg POEA/L) and its components individually (glyphosate: 13–27.2 mg/L, POEA: 0.6–4.8 mg/L), which indicates hormetic effects. However, decreased photosynthetic activity was detected at higher concentrations of POEA (19.2 mg/L) and Roundup Classic (11.6–50.6 mg glyphosate/L). Differences were demonstrated in the sensitivity of the selected algae species and, in addition to the individual and combined toxicity of the components presented in the glyphosate-based herbicides. Both of the observed inhibitory and stimulating effects can adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems and water quality of surface waters. © 2024 by the authors.",Toxics,12,NA,NA,Normal
10.3390/toxics12080590,2,0,2,Perinatal Exposure to Glyphosate or a Commercial Formulation Alters Uterine Mechanistic Pathways Associated with Implantation Failure in Rats,151,Almirón A.; Lorenz V.; Varayoud J.; Durando M.; Milesi M.M.,2024,"Perinatal exposure to a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) or its active ingredient, glyphosate (Gly), has been demonstrated to increase implantation failure in rats. This study investigates potential mechanisms of action, analyzing uterine preparation towards the receptive state. Pregnant Wistar rats (F0) were treated orally with GBH or Gly (3.8 and 3.9 mg Gly/kg/day, respectively) from gestational day (GD) 9 until weaning. Adult F1 females became pregnant and uterine samples were collected on GD5 (preimplantation period). Histomorphological uterine parameters were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was applied to evaluate cell proliferation and protein expression of estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), cell cycle regulators (PTEN, cyclin G1, p27, and IGF1R-α), and the Wnt5a/β-catenin/FOXA2/Lif pathway. Both GBH and Gly females showed increased stromal proliferation, associated with a high expression of ERs. Dysregulation of PTEN and cyclin G1 was also observed in the Gly group. Reduced gland number was observed in both groups, along with decreased expression of Wnt5a/β-catenin/FOXA2/Lif pathway in the glandular epithelium. Overall, GBH and Gly perinatal exposure disrupted intrinsic uterine pathways involved in endometrial proliferation and glandular function, providing a plausible mechanism for glyphosate-induced implantation failure by compromising uterine receptivity. Similar effects between GBH and Gly suggest the active principle mainly drives the adverse outcomes. © 2024 by the authors.",Toxics,12,NA,NA,Normal

While most of the previous studies focused on the toxicity of analytical grade of Fenpropathrin, insufficient attention has been paid to compare toxicity of the active ingredient (a.i) with its commercial formulation. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to evaluate the lethal as well as sublethal toxicity along with cardiac, morphological, behavioral and neurotoxic biomarker responses induced by Fenpropathrin and its commercial formulation Meothrin and Danitol on zebrafish embryos. The study reveals 96-hour (h) LC50 values that are 0.156(0.121-0.202), 0.953(0.736-1.248) and 1.168(0.913- 1.503) mg a.i/L; 96 h EC50 values are 0.016, 0.152 and 0.369 mg a.i/L and Teratogenic Index (TI) ratio of 9.75, 6.26 and 3.16 for Fenpropathrin, Meothrin and Danitol respectively (Fenpropathrin>Meothrin>Danitol). The reduction in toxicity in commercial formulations may be attributed to Control Release Systems (CRS). The study also reveals that intensity of malformations, teratogenic potential, behavioral abnormality, cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity are more prominent in Fenpropathrin when compared to its two formulations.",TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,23,NA,NA,Normal

Robins Methanol Extract against Brown Planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål.)",106,Zaki N.I.M.; Asib N.; Shari E.S.; Ahmad-Hamdani M.S.,2024,"The rice brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål.), is a highly damaging insect pest to rice crops. The excessive use of synthetic chemicals has resulted in the development of resistance to insecticides and negative consequences for the environment and insect biodiversity. Hence, three common weed species, namely Ageratum conyzoides, Chromolaena odorata, and Mallotus paniculatus, were evaluated on the comparative extraction yield in different solvents, as well as the toxicity potential in the selected methanol extract. Further, the bioactive compounds in C. odorata were characterized, and potential bio-insecticide formulations were developed and evaluated on the BPH. Methanol extract displayed higher efficiency, yielding 17.29% compared to only 3.19% in hexane extract. Insecticidal activity evaluation demonstrated that C. odorata exhibited the highest toxicity (77.50% at 10,000 ppm), having a median lethal concentration (LC50) value of 977 ppm, while A. conyzoides (55.20% at 10,000 ppm) and M. paniculatus (60.0% at 12,000 ppm) produced LC50 values of 6,549 ppm and 21,940 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, a plant-based bio-insecticide was formulated using the crude methanol extract of C. odorata as the active ingredient. A mixture of surfactant (Emersense® AM 8025), oil (palm kernel oil ester), and water resulted in a stable macroemulsion called Emersense® AM 8025/palm kernel oil ester/water (EM-PKOE). The formulated macroemulsion displayed enhanced toxicity and efficacy against BPH nymphs, with an LC50 value of 220 ppm, outperforming the unformulated crude methanol extract (977 ppm). Chemical composition analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that C. odorata primarily contained sesquiterpenes (24.14%). This study proposes C. odorata as a potential bio-insecticide for BPH combatants, necessitating further research on the formulation for eventual commercialization to sustainable BPH control in rice cultivation. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.",Pertanika Journal of Tropical Agricultural Science,47,1445,1471,Nano

The herbicides atrazine and glyphosate are used worldwide to control weeds in agricultural crops, and their indiscriminate use results in their constant presence in the environment. In this sense, this study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic potential, the presence of chromosomal aberrations and nuclear abnormalities, and the frequency of micronuclei of active ingredients and commercial formulations of the herbicides atrazine (AT = 2 and 25 mu g L-1) and glyphosate (GF = 65 and 160 mu g L-1) isolated and in mixture (MIX = 2 + 65 and 25 + 160 mu g L-1). Allium cepa root meristem cells were used as the test organism to evaluate environmentally relevant concentrations. Treatments containing the herbicides inhibited the mitotic index (ATAI2: 9.40 +/- 1.36; GFAI65: 8.58 +/- 1.10; MIXAI2+65: 6.99 +/- 0.57; GFAI160: 9.77 +/- 1.08; ATCOM25: 7.40 +/- 1.38; GFCOM160: 8.26 +/- 0.79) and showed chromosomal aberrations and nuclear abnormalities (ATAI2: 0.85 +/- 0.17; ATCOM2: 0.97 +/- 0.18; GFCOM65: 1.00 +/- 0.18; MIXCOM2+65: 1.09 +/- 0.25; ATAI25: 0.82 +/- 0.17; GFAI160: 0.87 +/- 0.23; MIXAI25+160: 0.95 +/- 0.19; ATCOM25: 0.67 +/- 0.19; MIXCOM25+160: 0.80 +/- 0.25), indicating the cytotoxic/genotoxic potential of these herbicides. Mutagenic effects were seen in the mixture of the active ingredients of the herbicides at the lowest concentration tested (MIXAI2+65: 0.70 +/- 0.57). These results indicate that the isolated herbicides and their mixture directly affect the genetic material. Therefore, we suggest reviewing the acceptable limits of these herbicides in the environment, emphasizing the importance and care required for properly handling these products to minimize environmental and human health risks.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Contamination,18,38,50,Normal

The soil material (n = 5) used for the study was collected from the mollic horizon of two Chernozems differed in physicochemical properties. HM was obtained in the solid state after extracting humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) in NaOH and digesting the mineral fraction in an HF-HCl mixture. For investigation the pure active substance of pendimethalin (PE) and its two commercial products (Penfox 330 EC and Stomp Aqua 455 SC) were used, which were dissolved in hexane and added to the HM. The batch sorption experiment was carried out in accordance with OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals No.106. Spectroscopic methods (UV-Vis-nearIR and fluorescence) were used to assess the molecular characteristics of HM exposed to pesticides. The study showed significant differences in the molecular structures of the tested HM as a result of interactions with the pesticides used. The PE has a different effect than commercial products. The obtained results prove that the composition of commercial products significantly modifies the strength and ability of organic matter to bind pesticides. This is probably related to the presence of adjuvants that are more competitive in forming bonds with the active sorption sites of HM, and thus strengthen or weaken the process of forming pesticide-HM complexes. © 2024, Polish Society Magnesium Research.
