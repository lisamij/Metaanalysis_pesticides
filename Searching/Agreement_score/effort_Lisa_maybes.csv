These substances are potentially toxic pollutants because they induce the production of reactive oxygen species for biological systems and exert oxidative stress in nontarget organisms living in the treated aquatic systems. Recent evidence suggests differences in the toxicity of glyphosate in the form of an active ingredient compared to the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with surfactants, such as those found in commercial formulations. In Mexico, one of the most widely used glyphosate-based herbicides is Yerbimat, which has agricultural as well as aquatic weed control applications. However, there are no aquatic toxicity data, particularly regarding native fish. Therefore, we determined the acute toxicity of commercial-formulation Yerbimat in a static bioassay at 96 h (LC 50). We also determined its toxicity at 96 h in sublethal concentrations to assess the lipid peroxidation levels (LPX), catalase activity, hepatic glycogen content, and histological damage in the liver and gills of the fish Goodea atripinnis associated with chronic exposure (75 days). The LC 50 was 38.95 ± 0.33 mg/L. The results of the short-term exposure study indicate that Yerbimat can potentially induce oxidative stress in G. atripinnis, because LPX was increased in the gills and liver. Catalase activity was reduced in the gills but increased in the liver, whereas hepatic glycogen was depleted. Chronic exposure was associated with histopathological damage in the gills and liver, some of which was irreversible. Yerbimat represents a potential risk for aquatic biota; therefore, we recommend that its application be carefully considered. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2011,16

Series A, Ecological and Biological","The influence of the pesticides HCH and benomyl on nitrification in a flooded autoclaved soil was compared with that in culture media inoculated with Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter spp. The rate of nitrification was slow in autoclaved soil and was comparatively faster in the culture media, and both the pesticides inhibited nitrification at concentrations of 5 ppm and above. Commercial formulations of HCH and benomyl were more toxic to nitrifying bacteria than the technical grade, probably due to interactions of the carriers and pesticides in increasing the toxicity. © 1983.",1983,91
7,Lisa,not vetted,Könen S.; Çavaş T.,Genotoxicity testing of the herbicide trifluralin and its commercial formulation treflan using the piscine micronucleus test,Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis,"In this study, the genotoxic effects of a widely used herbicide, trifluralin, and its commercial formulation, Treflan, were evaluated using the micronucleus test in a commercially important fish species, Oreochromis niloticus (Nile Tilapia). Fish were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 μg/L doses of trifluralin and Treflan for 3, 6, and 9 days under laboratory conditions. Ethylmethanesulfonate, at a single dose of 10 mg/L, was used as positive control. Micronuclei were evaluated on the peripheral erythrocytes. Both Treflan and trifluralin treatments significantly increased the micronucleus frequencies in peripheral erythrocytes of O. niloticus. Furthermore, the genotoxicity of the active ingredient, trifluralin, was observed to be higher than that of the commercial formulation Treflan. Our results indicate that herbicide trifluralin has genotoxic potential in fish. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2008,149

This study aims to investigate the functional impact of in vitro exposure of pig spermatozoa to low concentrations of Roundup® Ultra Plus (RUP), similar to those present as environment contaminants, to its active ingredient glyphosate, and to the non-active component, surfactant polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA). Pig spermatozoa were incubated in Tyrode's basal medium (TBM) or Tyrode's complete medium (TCM) (1 h at 38.5 °C) with several RUP dilutions or equivalent concentrations of glyphosate or POEA. RUP treatment causes a significant dilution-dependent decrease in sperm motility, a significant increase in plasma membrane disorganization and reduction in GSK3β phosphorylation (TBM) and in two PKA substrates (TBM and TCM), whereas does not affect sperm viability or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Equivalent glyphosate concentrations do not affect any functional sperm parameters. However, POEA concentrations equivalent to RUP dilutions mimic all RUP sperm effects: decrease sperm motility in a concentration-dependent manner, increase sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder and significantly inhibit GSK3β phosphorylation (TBM) and two PKA substrates without affecting sperm viability or MMP. In summary, low concentrations RUP herbicide cause sperm motility impairment without affecting sperm viability. This adverse effect could be likely due to a detrimental effect in the plasma membrane lipid organization and to inhibition of phosphorylation of both, GSK3β and specific PKA substrates. Importantly, our results indicate that negative effects of low RUP concentrations in pig spermatozoa function are likely caused by the surfactant included in its formulation and no by its active ingredient glyphosate. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,634
23,Lisa,not vetted,Tanaka Y.,Ecological risk assessment of pollutant chemicals: Extinction risk based on population-level effects,Chemosphere,"The extinction probability is one of the most useful endpoints that are utilized in conservation biology. A parallel approach is advocated for the ecological risk assessment of chemical pollutants. The presented framework estimates extinction probability induced by pollutant chemicals in order to evaluate ecological hazards of pollution, and is applicable to any biological community (aquatic or terrestrial). The analytical framework, which is based on stochastic population dynamics theory, is briefly explained. The extinction risk estimation is feasible if ecotoxicological data concerning pollutant effects on population growth rate of organisms (the intrinsic rate of natural increase), and if environmental exposure concentration is provided. Tentative risk estimation was made for some agrochemicals and surfactants on zooplankton populations (Daphnia) as target organisms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2003,988
38,Lisa,not vetted,Munk R.; Schulz V.,Study of possible teratogenic effects of the fungicide maneb on chick embryos,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The teratogenicity of the fungicide maneb (80% active ingredient and 20% inert ingredients) in chick embryos was evaluated. Eggs, before incubation, were dipped in 0.2% or 1.2% aqueous dispersions of maneb for 30 seconds. An untreated group, a water group and a formulation ingredient group, at the concentration present in the 1.2% maneb group, ensured control in the study. Eggs were incubated for 18 days then transfered to hatching racks and allowed to hatch normally. Viable chicks and chicks ""dead in shell"" were assessed for external deformaties. There was no evidence that maneb or its formulation ingredients were teratogenic or embryotoxic to developing chick embryos. © 1989.",1989,2274

But, the additives may not have been tested as thoroughly as the chief ingredients. The surfactant, nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40), is an additive frequently present in pesticide formulations. We investigated the effects of NP40 and other constituents of a validamycin pesticide formulation on cell viability and on the expression of genes involved in cell damage pathways. Methods: The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Results: The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up- and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/ arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064). The 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene, within the heat shock protein/unfolded protein response category, showed the highest individual increase in expression (26.1-fold). Conclusions: NP40 appeared to be particularly harmful, inducing gene expression changes that indicated genotoxicity, activation of the cell death (necrosis signaling) pathway, and induction of the 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene. © 2015 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine.",2015,3720
56,Lisa,not vetted,"Kocaman, AY; Topaktas, M",The In Vitro Genotoxic Effects of a Commercial Formulation of alpha-Cypermethrin in Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes,ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS,"alpha-Cypermethrin, a highly active pyrethroid insecticide, is effective against a wide range of insects encountered in agriculture and animal husbandry. The potential genotoxicity of a commercial formulation of (x-cypermethrin (Fastac 100 EC, containing 10% alpha-cypermethrin as the active ingredient) on human peripheral lymphocytes was examined in vitro by sister chromatid exchange (SCIE), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and micronucleus (MN) tests. The human lymphocytes were treated with 5, 10, 15, and 20 mu g/ml of a-cypermethrin for 24- and 48-hr. alpha-Cypermethrin induced SCEs and CAs significantly at all concentrations and treatment times and MN formation was significantly induced at 5 and 10 mu g/ml of alpha-cypermethrin when compared with both the control and solvent control. Binuclear cells could not be detected sufficiently in the highest two concentration of alpha-cypermethrin (15 and 20 mu g/ml) for both the 24- and 48-hr treatment times. alpha-Cypermethrin decreased the proliferation index (PI) at three high concentrations (10, 15, and 20 mu g/ml) for both treatment periods as compared with the control groups. In addition, alpha-cypermethrin reduced both the mitotic index (MI) and nuclear division index (NDI) significantly at all concentrations for two treatment periods. The PI and MI were reduced by alpha-cypermethrin in a concentration-dependent manner during both treatment times. In general, alpha-cypermethrin showed higher cytotoxic and cytostatic effects than positive control (MMC) at the two highest concentrations for the 24- and 48-hr treatment periods. The present study is the first to report the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of commercial formulation of a-cypermethrin in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 50:27-36, 2009.

96,Lisa,not vetted,"Jarrell, Zachery Ryan; Ahammad, Muslah Uddin; Benson, Andrew Parks",Glyphosate-based herbicide formulations and reproductive toxicity in animals,VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE,"The adoption of genetically engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has increased dramatically over the last few decades. Among the transgenic plants, those tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate are among the most common. Weed resistance to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) has been on the rise, leading to increased herbicide applications. This, in turn, has led to increased glyphosate residues in feed. Although glyphosate has been considered to be generally safe to animal health, recent studies have shown that GBHs have potential to cause adverse effects in animal reproduction, including disruption of key regulatory enzymes in androgen synthesis, alteration of serum levels of estrogen and testosterone, damage to reproductive tissues and impairment of gametogenesis. This review emphasizes known effects of GBHs on reproductive health as well as the potential risk GBH residues pose to animal agriculture.",2020,6001
