"Effect of Yerbimat herbicide on lipid peroxidation, catalase activity, and histological damage in gills and liver of the freshwater fish Goodea atripinnis",NO,1,Lisa,NO,Ortiz-Ordoñez E.; Uría-Galicia E.; Ruiz-Picos R.A.; Sánchez Duran A.G.; Hernández Trejo Y.; Sedeño-Díaz J.E.; López-López E.,Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"The use of herbicides for agricultural and aquatic weed control has increased worldwide. These substances are potentially toxic pollutants because they induce the production of reactive oxygen species for biological systems and exert oxidative stress in nontarget organisms living in the treated aquatic systems. Recent evidence suggests differences in the toxicity of glyphosate in the form of an active ingredient compared to the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with surfactants, such as those found in commercial formulations. In Mexico, one of the most widely used glyphosate-based herbicides is Yerbimat, which has agricultural as well as aquatic weed control applications. However, there are no aquatic toxicity data, particularly regarding native fish. Therefore, we determined the acute toxicity of commercial-formulation Yerbimat in a static bioassay at 96 h (LC 50). We also determined its toxicity at 96 h in sublethal concentrations to assess the lipid peroxidation levels (LPX), catalase activity, hepatic glycogen content, and histological damage in the liver and gills of the fish Goodea atripinnis associated with chronic exposure (75 days). The LC 50 was 38.95 ± 0.33 mg/L. The results of the short-term exposure study indicate that Yerbimat can potentially induce oxidative stress in G. atripinnis, because LPX was increased in the gills and liver. Catalase activity was reduced in the gills but increased in the liver, whereas hepatic glycogen was depleted. Chronic exposure was associated with histopathological damage in the gills and liver, some of which was irreversible. Yerbimat represents a potential risk for aquatic biota; therefore, we recommend that its application be carefully considered. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2011,16,TRUE
Comparative analysis of the effects of locally used herbicides and their active ingredients on a wild-type wine Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain,YES,2,Lisa,YES,Braconi D.; Sotgiu M.; Millucci L.; Paffetti A.; Tasso F.; Alisi C.; Martini S.; Rappuoli R.; Lusini P.; Sprocati A.R.; Rossi C.; Santucci A.,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,"Herbicides are released to the environment with potential ecotoxicological risks for mammals. Yeast is a good model to elucidate toxicity mechanisms. We investigated how three commercial herbicides (Proper Energy, Pointer, and Silglif) and their active ingredients (respectively, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, tribenuron methyl, and glyphosate) can affect biological activities of an oenological Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, which may be resident on grape vineyards of the same geographical areas where herbicides are used. The use of commercial grade herbicides employed in Italy allowed us to reproduce the same conditions applied in crops; at the same time, assaying pure single active compounds made it possible to compare the effects obtained with commercial formulations. Interestingly, we found that while pure active compounds affect cell growth and metabolism at a lower extent, commercial preparations have a significant major negative influence on yeast biology. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",2006,33,TRUE
Natural transformation of chlordecone into 5b-hydrochlordecone in French West Indies soils: statistical evidence for investigating long-term persistence of organic pollutants,NO,3,Lisa,NO,Devault D.A.; Laplanche C.; Pascaline H.; Bristeau S.; Mouvet C.; Macarie H.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Chlordecone (CLD) was an organochlorine insecticide whose previous use resulted in an extensive pollution of the environment with severe health effects and social consequences. A closely related compound, 5b-hydrochlordecone (5b-hydroCLD), has been searched for and often detected in environmental matrices from the geographical area where CLD was applied. The current consensus considered that its presence was not the result of a biotic or abiotic dechlorination of CLD in these matrices but rather the consequence of its presence as impurity (synthesis by-product) in the CLD released into the environment. The aim of the present study was to determine if and to what extent degradation of CLD into 5b-hydroCLD occurred in the field. To test this hypothesis, the ratios of 5b-hydroCLD and CLD concentrations in a dataset of 810 soils collected between 2006 and 2012 in Martinique were compared to the ratios measured in 3 samples of the CLD dust commercial formulations applied in the banana fields of French West Indies (FWI) and 1 sample of the technical-grade CLD corresponding to the active ingredient used in such formulations. Soil data were processed with a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for random measurement errors and data censoring. Any pathway of CLD transformation into 5b-hydroCLD occurring over the long term in FWI soils would indeed change the ratio of 5b-hydroCLD/CLD compared to what it was in the initially applied formulations. Results showed a significant increase of the 5b-hydroCLD/CLD ratio in the soils—25 times greater in soil than in commercial formulations—which suggested that natural CLD transformation into 5b-hydroCLD over the long term occurred in these soils. Results from this study may impact future decisions for the remediation of the polluted areas. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2016,82,TRUE
Toxicity of the pesticides hexachlorocyclohexane and benomyl to nitrifying bacteria in flooded autoclaved soil and in culture media,YES,4,Lisa,YES,Ray R.C.,"Environmental Pollution. Series A, Ecological and Biological","The influence of the pesticides HCH and benomyl on nitrification in a flooded autoclaved soil was compared with that in culture media inoculated with Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter spp. The rate of nitrification was slow in autoclaved soil and was comparatively faster in the culture media, and both the pesticides inhibited nitrification at concentrations of 5 ppm and above. Commercial formulations of HCH and benomyl were more toxic to nitrifying bacteria than the technical grade, probably due to interactions of the carriers and pesticides in increasing the toxicity. © 1983.",1983,91,TRUE
"Comparative Toxicity of Herbicide Active Ingredients, Safener Additives, and Commercial Formulations to the Nontarget Alga Raphidocelis Subcapitata",YES,5,Lisa,YES,Lanasa S.; Niedzwiecki M.; Reber K.P.; East A.; Sivey J.D.; Salice C.J.,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Chloroacetanilide herbicides are used worldwide to control weeds that affect crops such as corn, soybeans, and cotton. These herbicides are frequently paired with a “safener,” which prevents herbicidal damage to the crop without diminishing weed control. Formulated herbicide products that include safeners and other ingredients are infrequently assessed for toxicity. Our goal was to understand the potential toxicity of safeners and herbicide + safener formulations relative to the toxicity of associated active ingredients. We quantified the concentration of safeners in commercially available formulations and tested effects on nontarget algae, Raphidocelis subcapitata, when exposed to individual herbicide active ingredients, safeners, and commercial formulations. The median effective concentrations (EC50s) causing 50% reduction in population growth for the herbicide active ingredients S-metolachlor and acetochlor were 0.046 and 0.003 ppm, respectively. The safeners benoxacor, AD-67, furilazole, and dichlormid were all substantially less toxic than the herbicides and were not toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations. The commercial formulations Dual II Magnum®, Me-Too-Lachlor II®, Harness®, and Surpass EC® all resulted in EC50 values that fell within the 95% confidence interval of the associated active ingredient herbicide. Interestingly, a significant increase in cell size was observed when algae were exposed to all the formulations, herbicides (acetochlor and S-metolachlor), and safener (dichlormid). The safener furilazole caused a significant decrease in cell size, whereas benoxacor and AD-67 had no observed effect on algae cell size. Significant algae cell size effects all occurred at or above the EC50 concentrations for each chemical, suggesting that other morphological effects may be occurring. Importantly, safeners in commercial formulations appeared not to impact toxicity to R. subcapitata compared with the active ingredient alone. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;41:1466–1476. © 2022 SETAC. © 2022 SETAC.",2022,100,TRUE
Scope of commercial formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner as an alternative to Methyl bromide against Tribolium castaneum adults,NO,6,Lisa,NO,Ahmedani M.S.; Haque M.I.; Afzal S.N.; Iqbal U.; Naz S.,Pakistan Journal of Botany,"Montreal protocol has deprived the world from Methyl bromide which had been used as one of the most effective pesticide since many decades. Alternative fumigation methods are therefore urgently required to fill this gap in relation to the pest control especially the stored grain insect pest management. Investigations were therefore carried out to evaluate the potential role of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) as a natural pest control agent against the rust red flour beetle. Different formulations of the pathogens were tested for their efficacy against the pest. Results revealed that two out of the three commercial formulations used in the experiment i.e., Dipel ES and Bactospeine showed moderate results with 59.33 and 54.66 % mortality. Ecotech Pro was however found to be the most effective exhibiting 79.66 % mortality after 7 days of the treatment. The results further revealed that liquid formulations yielded comparatively better results as compared to the powder formulation. Mortality exhibited in case of Ecotech Pro was perhaps due to its active ingredient transconjugant Bt kurstaki x Bt aizawi, its potency as well as more ingestion of the Bt spores and toxins because of its liquid base. Liquid formulations not only enhanced the moisture contents but also made the grain more palatable for T. castaneum adults resulting in more mortality as compared to dry formulation.",2008,103,TRUE
Genotoxicity testing of the herbicide trifluralin and its commercial formulation treflan using the piscine micronucleus test,YES,7,Lisa,YES,Könen S.; Çavaş T.,Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis,"In this study, the genotoxic effects of a widely used herbicide, trifluralin, and its commercial formulation, Treflan, were evaluated using the micronucleus test in a commercially important fish species, Oreochromis niloticus (Nile Tilapia). Fish were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 μg/L doses of trifluralin and Treflan for 3, 6, and 9 days under laboratory conditions. Ethylmethanesulfonate, at a single dose of 10 mg/L, was used as positive control. Micronuclei were evaluated on the peripheral erythrocytes. Both Treflan and trifluralin treatments significantly increased the micronucleus frequencies in peripheral erythrocytes of O. niloticus. Furthermore, the genotoxicity of the active ingredient, trifluralin, was observed to be higher than that of the commercial formulation Treflan. Our results indicate that herbicide trifluralin has genotoxic potential in fish. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",2008,149,TRUE
Trophoblast toxicity of the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid and an acetamiprid-based formulation,YES,8,Lisa,YES,Gomez S.D.; Bustos P.S.; Sánchez V.G.; Ortega M.G.; Guiñazú N.,Toxicology,"The neonicotinoid (Neo) insecticide family is a relatively new class of pesticides of growing use. There is an increasing concern that human exposure to environmental pollutants in utero may be associated with diseases in adulthood. A functional placenta and trophoblasts are a requisite for a healthy pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the Neo Acetamiprid (Ace) and one of its commercial formulations (Ace CF) display toxic features to a human first trimester trophoblast cell line. HTR-8/SVneo cells were cultured in the presence of Ace or Ace CF (0.1–100 μM) for 4 and 24 h, and changes in cell viability, reactive oxygen species, antioxidant system and macromolecule damage levels were evaluated. Ace and Ace CF are cytotoxic for HTR-8/SVneo trophoblasts. Cell viability loss and oxidative imbalance were triggered by Ace and Ace CF treatments. Impact in the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and gluthatione S-transferase activities were observed after 24 h exposure to Ace CF. Moreover, Ace CF caused oxidative damage in proteins, lipids and DNA, whereas Ace only damaged proteins. To test oxidative stress as a toxicity mechanism, cells were pre-incubated with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), prior Neo treatment. NAC protected trophoblasts from cell death and prevented oxidative damage. Results demonstrate that Ace (as active principle or CF) is cytotoxic for human trophoblasts, and oxidative stress is a toxicity mechanism.

Growth and survival of five amphibian species exposed to combinations of pesticides,NO,9,Lisa,NO,Relyea R.A.,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The global decline of amphibians has sparked interest in the role that pesticides may play. Pesticides in nature typically exist in combinations, but given the vast number of chemicals used, most toxicological experiments necessarily have examined one pesticide at a time. I examined how four commercial formulations of pesticides (diazinon, carbaryl, malathion, and glyphosate) affected the survival and growth of five larval amphibian species (Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo americanus, and Hyla versicolor) when alone (at 1 or 2 mg/L of active ingredient) and in pairwise combinations (1 mg/L of each pesticide). At 1 mg/L, the pesticides reduced survival in 5% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reduced growth in 35% of the comparisons. At 2 mg/L, the pesticides had more widespread effects, reducing survival in 35% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reducing growth in 70% of comparisons. Combined pesticides occasionally caused lower survival and growth than either pesticide alone, but the effects were never larger than the more deadly of the two pesticides alone at 2 mg/L. This suggests that the impact of combining these four pesticides is similar to that predicted by the total concentration of pesticides in the system.",2004,299,TRUE
Toxicity induced by glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides in the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line (ZF-L),YES,10,Lisa,YES,Lopes F.M.; Sandrini J.Z.; Souza M.M.,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Glyphosate is the active component of many commonly used herbicides; it can reach bodies of water through irrigated rice plantations. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of glyphosate and Roundup® (a glyphosate-based herbicide) in established culture of the zebrafish hepatocyte cell line ZF-L after 24 and 48 h of exposure to concentrations of 650 and 3250 µg/L. We observed a reduction in metabolic activity and lysosomal integrity, and an increase in cell number after 24 h of Roundup® exposure at the highest concentration. An increase in active mitochondria and apoptotic cells was observed following 24 h exposure to glyphosate and Roundup®, while only exposure to Roundup® induced an increase in necrotic cells. Rhodamine B accumulation decreased after 48 h exposure to 650 µg/L of Roundup®; this reduction is indicative of increased activity of ABC pumps. Overall, the present findings highlighted the hazard of glyphosate exposure not only in the commercial formulation but also glyphosate alone, since both can induce damage in the ZF-L cell line primarily through the induction of apoptosis. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,356,TRUE

"Anabaena-azollae, significance and agriculture application: A case study for symbiotic cyanobacterium",NO,12,Lisa,NO,Abd El-Aal A.A.M.,Microbial Syntrophy-mediated Eco-enterprising,"Anabaena azollae is a heterocystous filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium that is naturally growing symbiotically in specialized leaf cavities of a small eukaryotic water fern Azolla pinnata. It is well documented that Anabaena azollae has been successfully grown and propagated freely in synthetic media like BG-110 with pleasant biomass. A. azollae is considered a promising natural biosource for agricultural, medicinal, and industrial applications. Where the cyanobacterium biomass and/or extract greatly enhanced the physical and chemical properties of soil texture. It is also well-known to produce several biologically active substances against a wide array of plant-infecting pathogens. Moreover, it is considered a good phycoremediator of industrial wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of A. azollae, a case study for its characteristics, significance with a special focus on its agricultural applications. The commercial production and exploitation of A. azollae-derived materials with interesting properties such as fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, insecticides, biofertilizers, as well as its phycoremediation ability were highlighted in detail in this review. Numerous growths promoting substances like indole acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), bioactives such as fatty acids, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds were extracted from A. azollae, and reported to have in vitro and in vivo microbicidal effects. Additionally, the high nitrogenase activity of A. azollae has been accepted as a pioneer indicator for its biofertilization ability. Strikingly, the induced dehydrogenase activity and its polysaccharides excretions were reported to increase soil fertility by increasing the soil microbial communities. Thus, A. azollae could provide multiple benefits to the agricultural sector and can be considered as a promising and safe bio-inoculant in recent trends of organic farming. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Impaired mammalian sperm function and lower phosphorylation signaling caused by the herbicide Roundup® Ultra Plus are due to its surfactant component,YES,14,Lisa,YES,Torres-Badia M.; Solar-Malaga S.; Martin-Hidalgo D.; Hurtado de Llera A.; Gomez-Candelo A.; Garcia-Marin L.J.; González-Fernández L.; Bragado M.J.,Theriogenology,"The use of worldwide glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup® is growing and to date its effects on mammalian spermatozoa are controversial. This study aims to investigate the functional impact of in vitro exposure of pig spermatozoa to low concentrations of Roundup® Ultra Plus (RUP), similar to those present as environment contaminants, to its active ingredient glyphosate, and to the non-active component, surfactant polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA). Pig spermatozoa were incubated in Tyrode's basal medium (TBM) or Tyrode's complete medium (TCM) (1 h at 38.5 °C) with several RUP dilutions or equivalent concentrations of glyphosate or POEA. RUP treatment causes a significant dilution-dependent decrease in sperm motility, a significant increase in plasma membrane disorganization and reduction in GSK3β phosphorylation (TBM) and in two PKA substrates (TBM and TCM), whereas does not affect sperm viability or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Equivalent glyphosate concentrations do not affect any functional sperm parameters. However, POEA concentrations equivalent to RUP dilutions mimic all RUP sperm effects: decrease sperm motility in a concentration-dependent manner, increase sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder and significantly inhibit GSK3β phosphorylation (TBM) and two PKA substrates without affecting sperm viability or MMP. In summary, low concentrations RUP herbicide cause sperm motility impairment without affecting sperm viability. This adverse effect could be likely due to a detrimental effect in the plasma membrane lipid organization and to inhibition of phosphorylation of both, GSK3β and specific PKA substrates. Importantly, our results indicate that negative effects of low RUP concentrations in pig spermatozoa function are likely caused by the surfactant included in its formulation and no by its active ingredient glyphosate. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,634,TRUE

Dissipation of a commercial mixture of polyoxyethylene amine surfactants in aquatic outdoor microcosms: Effect of water depth and sediment organic carbon,NO,16,Lisa,NO,Rodriguez-Gil J.L.; Lissemore L.; Solomon K.; Hanson M.,Science of the Total Environment,"This study optimized existing analytical approaches and characterized the effect of sediment total organic carbon (0.05-2.05% TOC), and water depth (15, 30, and 90 cm) on the fate of MON 0818, a commercial mixture of polyoxyethylene amine surfactants (POEAs), in outdoor microcosms. Mixtures of POEAs are commonly used as adjuvants in commercial herbicide formulations containing glyphosate. Until recently, analytical methods sensitive enough to monitor environmental concentrations of POEAs in aquatic systems were not available. After optimizing recently developed analytical methods, we found that the combined use of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry provided a reliable approach for determining the concentration of sediment-adsorbed POEAs. The surfactant showed strong affinity for sediment materials, with low maximum recoveries by ASE of 52%. Under microcosm conditions, water depth or sediment characteristics did not significantly affect the water-column half-life of POEA, which ranged from 3.2 to 5.3 h. Binding of POEAs to suspended solids was observed, which dissipated via one- or two-phase exponential decay; when two-phase decay occurred, fast phase half-life values ranged from 0.71 to 1.3 h and slow-phase values ranged from 18 to 44 h. Concentrations of POEA increased in sediment shortly after application and decreased over the study period with a half-life of 5.8 to 71 d. The concentrations of POEAs in the sediment of the shallow (15 cm) ponds dissipated following a two-phase exponential decay model with an initial fast-phase half-life of 1.1 to 8.9 d and a slower second-phase half-life of 21 d. Our results suggest that aquatic organisms are unlikely to be exposed to POEAs in aqueous phase for periods of more than a few hours following an over-water application, and that sediment is a significant sink for POEAs in aquatic systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,836,TRUE

The strain NT2 degraded 4-NT (400 mg l-1) with rapid growth at the end of 120 h, reduced surface tension of the media from 71 to 29 mN m-1 and produced glycolipidic biosurfactants (45 mg l-1). The biosurfactant was purified and characterized as trehalose lipids. The biosurfactant was stable in high salinity (10 % w/v NaCl), elevated temperatures (120 °C for 15 min) and a wide pH range (2.0-10.0). The noticeable changes during biodegradation were decreased hydrophobicity; an increase in degree of fatty acid saturation, saturated/unsaturated ratio and cyclopropane fatty acid. Biodegradation of 4-NT was accompanied by the accumulation of ammonium (NH4 +) and negligible amount of nitrite ion (NO2 -). Product stoichiometry showed a carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mass balance of 37 and 35 %, respectively. Biodegradation of 4-NT proceeded by oxidation at the methyl group to form 4-nitrobenzoate, followed by reduction and hydrolytic deamination yielding protocatechuate, which was metabolized through β-ketoadipate pathway. In vitro and in vivo acute toxicity assays in adult rat (Rattus norvegicus) showed sequential detoxification and the order of toxicity was 4-NT >4-nitrobenzyl alcohol >4-nitrobenzaldehyde >4-nitrobenzoate >> protocatechuate.

Evaluation of green silicone surfactant-based vortex assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for sample preparation of organophosphorus pesticide residues in honey and fruit sample,NO,19,Lisa,NO,Elencovan V.; Yahaya N.; Samad N.A.; Zain N.N.M.,Journal of Separation Science,"A vortex-assisted surfactant enhanced emulsification liquid-liquid microextraction based on non-ionic silicone surfactant was successfully developed for the determination of organophosphorus pesticides in food samples coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A new type of non-ionic silicone surfactant composed of polysiloxane chains was employed as a green emulsifier to facilitate the emulsification of extraction solvent into the sample matrix, thereby intensifying the mass transfer of target analytes into the organic phase. The variables that affect the extraction were systematically optimized: 80 μl of hexane and 0.5% (v/v) of silicone surfactant were used as extraction solvent and surfactant respectively, the solution was mixed well under vortex agitation for 1 min with the addition of 4% (w/v) sodium sulfate.

Mp could be estimated by a linear regression relating Mp to the leaf surface roughness, as determined by the contact angle of a droplet of 50 % acetone on the leaf surface.

Adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds onto a hydrophobic carbonaceous geosorbent in the presence of surfactants,NO,21,Lisa,NO,Wang P.; Keller A.A.,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs; atrazine and diuron) onto lampblack was studied in the presence of nonionic, cationic, and anionic surfactants (Triton® X-100), benzalkonium chloride [BC], and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate [LAS]) to determine the effect of the surfactant on HOC adsorption onto a hydrophobic carbonaceous geosorbent. Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate showed an adsorption capacity higher than that of BC but similar to that of Triton X-100, implying the charge property of a surfactant is not a useful indicator for predicting the surfactant's adsorption onto a hydrophobic medium. The results also indicated that the octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW) of a surfactant is not a good predictor of that surfactant's sorption onto a hydrophobic medium. Under subsaturation adsorption conditions (i.e., before sorption saturation is reached), surfactant adsorption reduced HOC adsorption to a significant extent, with the reduction in HOC adsorption increasing monotonically with the amount of surfactant adsorbed. Among the three surfactants, Triton X-100 was the most effective in reducing HOC adsorption, whereas BC and LAS showed similar effectiveness in this regard. Under the same amount of the surfactant sorbed, the reduction in atrazine adsorption was consistently greater than that for diuron because of atrazine's lower hydrophobicity. No significant difference was observed in the amount of the HOC adsorbed under different adsorption sequences. Our results showed that the presence of surfactant can significantly decrease HOC adsorption onto hydrophobic environmental media and, thus, is important in predicting HOC fate and transport in the environment. © 2008 SETAC.",2008,945,TRUE
A novel method for the rapid determination of polyethoxylated tallow amine surfactants in water and sediment using large volume injection with high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry,NO,22,Lisa,NO,Ross A.R.S.; Liao X.,Analytica Chimica Acta,"Polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) surfactants have been used in many glyphosate-based herbicide formulations for agricultural, industrial and residential weed control. The potential for release of these compounds into the environment is of increasing concern due to their toxicity towards aquatic organisms. Current methods for analysis of POEA surfactants require significant time and effort to achieve limits of quantification that are often higher than the concentrations at which biological effects have been observed (as low as 2 ng mL-1). We have developed a rapid and robust method for quantifying the POEA surfactant mixture MON 0818 at biologically relevant concentrations in fresh water, sea water and lake sediment using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Water samples preserved by 1:1 v/v dilution with methanol are analyzed directly following centrifugation. Sediment samples undergo accelerated solvent extraction in aqueous methanol prior to analysis. Large volume (100 μL) sample injection and multiple reaction monitoring of a subset of the most abundant POEA homologs provide limits of quantification of 0.5 and 2.9 ng mL-1 for MON 0818 in fresh water and sea water, respectively, and 2.5 ng g-1 for total MON 0818 in lake sediment. Average recoveries of 93 and 75% were achieved for samples of water and sediment, respectively spiked with known amounts of MON 0818. Precision and accuracy for the analysis of water and sediment samples were within 10 and 16%, respectively based upon replicate analyses of calibration standards and representative samples. Results demonstrate the utility of the method for quantifying undegraded MON 0818 in water and sediment, although a more comprehensive method may be needed to identify and determine other POEA mixtures and degradation profiles that might occur in the environment. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2015,982,TRUE
Ecological risk assessment of pollutant chemicals: Extinction risk based on population-level effects,NO,23,Lisa,YES,Tanaka Y.,Chemosphere,"The extinction probability is one of the most useful endpoints that are utilized in conservation biology. A parallel approach is advocated for the ecological risk assessment of chemical pollutants. The presented framework estimates extinction probability induced by pollutant chemicals in order to evaluate ecological hazards of pollution, and is applicable to any biological community (aquatic or terrestrial). The analytical framework, which is based on stochastic population dynamics theory, is briefly explained. The extinction risk estimation is feasible if ecotoxicological data concerning pollutant effects on population growth rate of organisms (the intrinsic rate of natural increase), and if environmental exposure concentration is provided.

"Spray retention is affected by spray parameters, species, and adjuvants",NO,24,Lisa,NO,Bruns D.E.; Nalewaja J.D.,ASTM Special Technical Publication,"Spray retained by soybean, [Glycine max (L.) Merr. var. Ozzie], common lambsquarters [Chenopodium album (L.)], and redroot pigweed [Amaranthus retroflexus (L.)] was determined using a dye spectrophotometric method for water sprays (without pesticides) varying volume, droplet size, and adjuvants. Spray retained based on leaf area generally was greater for small than large droplets and more for surfactants than for oil adjuvants. Surfactants, Tergitol 15-S-9 and Tergitol 15-S-30, enhanced spray retained more for common lambsquarters than redroot pigweed or soybean. The oil adjuvants, methylated canola oil (MCO), canola oil (CO), and petroleum oil (PO) generally reduced spray retained by redroot pigweed, but generally increased spray retained by common lambsquarters compared to water spray alone. Spray retained by soybean was also increased by oil adjuvants, except for PO applied in droplets from an 8004 nozzle. Spray retained decreased as spray volume increased from 160 to 320 L/ha for surfactants and 80 to 160 L/ha for CO and MCO. Species retained more sprays as oil adjuvant concentration increased from 0.25 to 4% v/v. However, retention decreased when Tergitol 15-S-9 and 15-S-30 increased from 1 to 4%.

Improved formulations through synergistic combinations based on alkyl glucosides,NO,25,Lisa,NO,Bergström K.; Johansson I.M.,ASTM Special Technical Publication,"Sugar surfactants have attracted a lot of interest in the last decades, both due to technical properties as well as to the extremely favorable ecological and toxicological properties. It is well known that alcohol glucosides have excellent aqueous solubility, a low temperature dependence compared to nonionic ethoxylates, and are stable in the presence of high levels of electrolytes. Furthermore, they are compatible with an ionic, cationic, and other nonionic surfactants, making them extremely suitable for formulating concentrated products in the agrochemical area. In this paper, the synergistic effect of short-chained alkyl glucosides mixed with alcohol ethoxylates or amine derivatives have been investigated. These synergies have been manifested by lowering both surface tension and cmc as well as increasing wetting properties towards hydrophobic surfaces. The model system used contained agrochemical electrolytes such as glyphosate, MCPA-DMA salt and fertilizers. The relevance of the finding is supported by the increased bio-efficacy of a mixed adjuvant seen in a greenhouse test. Furthermore, this study shows that short-chained glucosides can be used as efficient solubilizers for adjuvants or wetting agents in high electrolyte system (i.e., fertilizers, active ingredients) to avoid phase separation. The effect has been assessed by studying the influence on cloud point as well as the amount of glucoside needed to solubilizer a nonionic wetting agent into a high electrolyte solution.

Biosurfactant producing microbes and their potential applications: A review,NO,27,Lisa,NO,Shekhar S.; Sundaramanickam A.; Balasubramanian T.,Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology,"Biosurfactants are surface-active biomolecules produced by microbes (bacteria, fungi, and yeast) and have several advantages over the chemical surfactants, such as lower toxicity, higher biodegradability, better environmental compatibility, higher foaming, high selectivity, and specific activity under extreme conditions such as temperature, pH, and salinity. Almost all the surfactants now available in the market are chemically synthesized. Recently, attention toward the biosurfactants was doubled, which is mainly due to their wide range of functional properties and the diverse synthetic capabilities of the microbes. Microbial biosurfactants are found to have a wide range of applications in environmental protection, which include enhancing oil recovery, controlling oil spills, biodegradation, and detoxification of oil-contaminated industrial effluents and soils. Biosurfactants produced by microorganisms have potential applications in pharmaceutical/medicine, food, cosmetic, pesticide, oil, and biodegradation industries. In this review article, we concentrated on three important aspects such as various types of biosurfactants, the group of microbes involved in the production of biosurfactants, and application of microbial biosurfactants.

Sodium dodecyl sulphate-enhanced desorption of atrazine: Effect of surfactant concentration and of organic matter content of soils,NO,28,Lisa,NO,Sanchez-Camazano M.; Sanchez-Martin M.J.; Rodriguez-Cruz M.S.,Chemosphere,"A study was made of the adsorption-desorption of atrazine in aqueous medium in five soils with organic matter (OM) contents in the range 1.4-10.3% and also of the desorption of the herbicide in aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at critical micelle concentrations (cmc) of 0.75, 1.50, 5 and 10. The adsorption and desorption isotherms in water together with the desorption isotherms in SDS solutions with concentrations of 0.75 and 1.50 cmc fit the Freundlich adsorption equation. All the desorption isotherms displayed hysteresis. The increase or reduction in hysteresis of the desorption isotherms in SDS solutions with respect to those of desorption in water depend on the SDS concentration and on the OM content of the soils. Below the cmc, SDS only increases the desorption of atrazine in the soil with the highest OM content (10.3%). However, above the cmc (5 and: 10 cmc) the desorption of atrazine increases in all soils, the efficiency of desorption increasing with the OM content of the soils.

Therefore, it is imperative to explore new and high effective fungicides. Constructing nanoscale fungicides using nanomaterial and nanotechnology has attracted wide attention in recent years. RESULTS: In this research, a pyraclostrobin solid nanodispersion (PSND) was prepared using the self-emulsifying method. The solid nanodispersion had a mean particle size of 20 nm and a zeta potential of -29.3 mV. The solubility and dissolution rate of the PSND increased owing to the decrease in particle size and the actions of the surfactants. The contact angle and retention volumes of the PSND on cucumber and cabbage leaf surfaces were greater than those of the commercial water dispersible granule. In addition, the median lethal concentration against Fusarium oxysporum was 0.7 43 µg mL−1. The toxicity of the nanoparticles was 4.5 times that of the water dispersible granule (WDG). The high fungicidal activity of PSND promoted the production of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). The activity levels of the antioxidant enzymes containing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) decreased in F. oxysporum. CONCLUSION: The research introduced a new method for preparing insoluble pyraclostrobin solid nanoformulation for fungicides to enhance the fungicidal activity and reduce environmental pollution. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2019,1353,TRUE
Surfactant mediated enhanced biodegradation of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers by Sphingomonas sp. NM05,NO,30,Lisa,NO,Manickam N.; Bajaj A.; Saini H.S.; Shanker R.,Biodegradation,"Environmental biodegradation of several chlorinated pesticides is limited by their low solubility and sorption to soil surfaces. To mitigate this problem we quantified the effect of three biosurfactant viz., rhamnolipid, sophorolipid and trehalose-containing lipid on the dissolution, bioavailability, and biodegradation of HCH-isomers in liquid culture and in contaminated soil. The effect of biosurfactants was evaluated through the critical micelle concentration (CMC) value as determined for each isomer. The surfactant increased the solubilization of HCH isomers by 3-9folds with rhamnolipid and sophorolipid being more effective and showing maximum solubilization of HCH isomers at 40 μg/mL, compared to trehalose-containing lipid showing peak solubilization at 60 μg/mL. The degradation of HCH isomers by Sphingomonas sp. NM05 in surfactant-amended liquid mineral salts medium showed 30% enhancement in 2 days as compared to degradation in 10 days in the absence of surfactant. HCH-spiked soil slurry incubated with surfactant also showed around 30-50% enhanced degradation of HCH which was comparable to the corresponding batch culture experiments. Among the three surfactants, sophorolipid offered highest solubilization and enhanced degradation of HCH isomers both in liquid medium and soil culture. The results of this study suggest the effectiveness of surfactants in improving HCH degradation by increased bioaccessibility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,1396,TRUE

Therefore, in this study, a synthesized cationic gemini surfactant (SCGS) was tested as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, anti-bacterial, anti-candida, anti-fungal, anti-biofilm (anti-adhesive), and bio-dispersion agent. The SCGS was evaluated as a biocide against environmental sulfidogenic-bacteria and as a corrosion inhibitor for a high salinity cultivated medium. The SCGS displayed wide spectrum antimicrobial activity with minimum bactericidal/fungicidal inhibitory concentrations. The SCGS demonstrated anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and bio-dispersion activity. The SCGS exhibited bactericidal activity against environmental sulfidogenic bacteria and the highest corrosion inhibition efficiency of 93.8% at 5 mM. Additionally, the SCGS demonstrated bio-dispersion activity against the environmental sulfidogenic bacteria at 5.49% salinity.

In this regard, different inhibitors were chosen, but environment unfriendliness of such inhibitors is a primary cause of concern. In this study, we present the systematic investigation of an environmentally benign compound, a glycine derivative N-benzylidine-2((2-oxo-2-(10H-phenothiazine-10yl)ethyl)amino) acetohydrazide (BPAA), as potential corrosion inhibitor at different temperature (30, 40, 50, and 60 °C). The investigation is accomplished by using the techniques including electrochemical polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), gravimetric, UV-visible spectrophotometry, FT-IR spectroscopy. The morphological characterization of the samples has been done by using high resolution SEM. The evaluated compound works as effective inhibitor for acid corrosion at substantially lower concentration and its adsorption on the MS surface was found to followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Calculated thermodynamic parameters for adsorption unveiled a strong interaction amongst the inhibitor-MS surface. The electrochemical results revealed that the inhibitor act as mixed-type. The corrosion inhibition efficiency (IE) of the inhibitor was synergistically enhanced in the presence of surfactant additives sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyl pyridinium chloride at quite lower concentration and showed that the addition of surfactant is an alternate strategy to enhance the IE and reduce the cost.

Factors influencing the spreading areas of pesticide droplets on the surface of maize leaves; [农药液滴在玉米叶片表面铺展面积的影响因素],NO,33,Lisa,NO,Gao R.; Huang L.; Wen S.; Yin X.; Zhang J.,Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering,"Pesticide wastes have caused serious pollution to the air, water, and soil in recent years. It is a high demand to clarify the spreading behavior of pesticide droplets on the plant leaves, particularly for the better utility efficiency of pesticides. Among them, the maximum spreading area of pesticide droplets on the plant leaves can dominate the action range, evaporation time, and foliar absorption of active ingredients in the pesticides. This study aims to explore the influence mechanism of droplet size, surfactant concentration, and leaf inclination on the maximum spreading area of droplets on the corn leaves. The leaf inclination angles were set as 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75°. The droplet sizes were 548, 675, 756, 877, and 973 μm. A droplet generator was used to produce the droplets of different sizes, further to reach the plant leaves at the free velocity. The solutions were utilized the 0, 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.005% of OP-10 surfactant. A full factorial experiment was designed with a total of 120 tests. The results show that there were significant effects of droplet size, surfactant concentration, and leaf inclination on the maximum spreading area (P<0.001). The influencing factors were ranked in the order of the surfactant concentration > droplet size > leaf angle. The partial-eta squares were 0.857, 0.473, and 0.073, respectively. A linear relationship was observed between the droplet size and the spreading area. The spreading area also increased with the increase of the droplet size, leaf angle, and solution surfactant concentration. Once the droplet size increased from 548 to 973 μm, the spreading area increased by 71.2% on average. When the leaf inclination angle was 75°, the average spreading area was 1.512 4 mm2. The spreading area increased by 18.0%, and 11.9%, compared with the 0°and 45°. The spreading area of 0.1% OP-10 on the maize leaves increased by an average of 572.7%, compared with the deionized water. Therefore, the droplet size increased the maximum spreading area of the droplets on the corn leaf surface with the same increased efficiency under different leaf inclination angles. Furthermore, the relationship between the droplet size and the maximum spreading area was y=0.001 7x+0.022 3, where the goodness of fit R2 was 0.969. It infers that the maximum spreading area of the droplet increased by 0.17 mm2 on average, particularly for every 100 μm increase in the droplet size. The highest value of 4.13mm2 was achieved in the maximum spreading area of 973 μm droplets at 0.1% concentration, when the leaf inclination angle was 75°. By contrast, the average level of the spread area was significantly higher at the 0.1% concentration, compared to the rest groups. The Pearson correlation analysis was carried out between the surface tension, contact angle, adhesion work, and spreading area of the solution. It was found that there was a significant positive correlation between the adhesion work and the spreading area (r=0.995, P=0.009). The adhesion work was well represented by the spreading area trend of the droplets on the leaf. Correspondingly, the surface tension of the liquid medicine was lower than the critical surface tension of the leaves in actual agricultural production. Furthermore, a greater surfactant composition was required for better wetting after atomization in the liquid medicine, compared with the critical micelle concentration. The 0.01%-0.1% OP-10 solution can be expected as a reference surfactant for higher spreading efficiency and better performance at a high level. The findings can provide a strong reference to understanding the spreading mechanism of pesticide droplets on the plant leaves. The particle size of pesticide droplets and the concentration of surfactants can also be adjusted for better spreading performance at the different leaf inclination angles. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The study was conducted at the Botanical Garden of the University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" between June and September 2002, the most favorable season for the development of Ae. albopictus in Italy. Black 20-liter plastic buckets containing water and an organic substrate were used as experimental breeding sites. The number of larvae in these buckets was estimated weekly, and positive buckets were treated with the recommended dose of the larvicide. The results showed that Vectobac DT induced 100% larval mortality after 24 h in all experimental breeding sites during the entire study period. Nonetheless, in most cases, the larvicidal activity only lasted about 48 h; thus, effective mosquito control would require that treatment be performed every 8-10 days in this habitat.

Phenotypic and molecular insights into heat tolerance of formulated cells as active ingredients of fungal insecticides,NO,41,Lisa,NO,Tong S.-M.; Feng M.-G.,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,"Abstract: Formulated conidia of insect-pathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria and Metarhizium, serve as the active ingredients of fungal insecticides but are highly sensitive to persistent high temperatures (32–35 °C) that can be beyond their upper thermal limits especially in tropical areas and during summer months. Fungal heat tolerance and inter- or intra-specific variability are critical factors and limitations to field applications of fungal pesticides during seasons favoring outbreaks of pest populations. The past decades have witnessed tremendous advances in improving fungal pesticides through selection of heat-tolerant strains from natural isolates, improvements and innovations in terms of solid-state fermentation technologies for the production of more heat-tolerant conidia, and the use of genetic engineering of candidate strains for enhancing heat tolerance. More recently, with the entry into a post-genomic era, a large number of signaling and effector genes have been characterized as important sustainers of heat tolerance in both Beauveria and Metarhizium, which represent the main species used as fungal pesticides worldwide. This review focuses on recent advances and provides an overview into the broad molecular basis of fungal heat tolerance and its multiple regulatory pathways. Emphases are placed on approaches for screening of heat-tolerant strains, methods for optimizing conidial quality linked to virulence and heat tolerance particularly involving cell wall architecture and optimized trehalose/mannitol contents, and how molecular determinants can be exploited for genetic improvement of heat tolerance and pest-control potential. Examples of fungal pesticides with different host spectra and their appropriateness for use in apiculture are given. Key points: • Heat tolerance is critical for field stability and efficacy of fungal insecticides. • Inter- and intra-specific variability exists in insect-pathogenic fungi. • Optimized production technology and biotechnology can improve heat tolerance. • Fungal heat tolerance is orchestrated by multiple molecular pathways. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2346,TRUE
Preparation of acetochlor microcapsules by interfacial polymerization and the environmental behavior and control efficacy,NO,42,Lisa,NO,Lan Y.; Hu Y.; Wang Y.; Guo Y.; Zhao H.; He L.; Qian K.,Scientia Agricultura Sinica,"【Objective】 The objective of this study is to prepare acetochlor microcapsules by interfacial polymerization and highlight interrelation among these formulations, biological effect and environmental effect. 【Method】 The acetochlor microcapsules were prepared by interfacial polymerization method with styrene, butyl methacrylate, and diacetone acrylamide in the O/W emulsion. The performances of acetochlor microcapsules such as morphological structure, size distribution and chemical group were characterized by FESEM, DLS, IR and so on. Meanwhile, through study on the release performance of acetochlor microcapsules, the acetochlor residues in soil and the control efficacy on weeds, connection among the release mechanism, environmental behavior and control efficacy were investigated. 【Result】The prepared acetochlor microcapsules are spherical, the average particle size is 1.552 μm, the loading efficiency is 60%, and the content of acetochlor in formulation is 20%. Under laboratory conditions, when pH values kept at pH 7.0, the cumulative release rates of acetochlor were about 50% to 70% on the 5th day, 60% to 90% on the 10th day, and 80% to nearly 100% on the 30th day from 20℃ to 45℃. In the pH range of 5.0 to 9.0, the cumulative release rates of acetochlor were from 60% to 70% on the 5th day, from below 70% to nearly 80% on the 10th day, about 80% on the 30th day, and nearly 100% on the 40th day. The release of acetochlor microcapsules (MC) was accelerated with the increase of temperature and pH. The grassy weeds and total weeds control efficacy were 80.2%-95.4%, and 67.8%-82.1% on the 20th day, 82.2%-92.4%, and 70.2%-80.9% on the 40th day, and 87.0%-97.2%, and 62.6%-91.3% on the 60th day; fresh weight control efficacy were 90.1%-98.0% and 70.3%-88.7% on the 60th day. For the conventional acetochlor concentrated emulsion, the grassy weeds and total weeds control efficacy were 80.4%-90.2%, and 54.8%-76.1% on the 20th day, 83.0%-91.2%, and 61.4%-79.8% on the 40th day, and 81.1%-88.3%, and 71.2%-84.0% on the 60th day, respectively, and fresh weight control efficacy were 80.3%-83.4% and 65.9%-74.0% on the 60th day. Under field conditions, the amount of acetochlor in the soil gradually reduced over time, and the active ingredient amount of acetochlor microcapsules was higher than that of acetochlor emulsifiable concentrate (EC), which extended the control time and ensured acetochlor microcapsules a better control efficacy.【Conclusion】This delivery carrier may be extended to other lipophilic pesticide in the future. At the same time, more pesticide active ingredient for microcapsules than that of EC can improve the weeds control efficacy, and reduce the number of spraying and amount of pesticide for EC, and relieve the pressure on the environment. © 2017 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Are topical insect repellents effective against malaria in endemic populations? A systematic review and meta-Analysis,NO,43,Lisa,NO,Wilson A.L.; Chen-Hussey V.; Logan J.G.; Lindsay S.W.,Malaria Journal,"Background: Recommended vector control tools against malaria, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), mainly target mosquitoes that rest and feed on human hosts indoors. However, in some malaria-endemic areas, such as Southeast Asia and South America, malaria vectors primarily bite outdoors meaning that LLINs and IRS may be less effective. In these situations the use of topical insect repellents may reduce outdoor biting and morbidity from malaria. A systematic review and meta-Analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of topical insect repellents against malaria. Methods: Studies were identified using database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and clinical trials registers), as well as reference list searches and contact with researchers. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included that assessed the effect of topical repellents (all active ingredients and concentrations) on Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria or infection in malaria-endemic populations. Meta-Analysis of clinical data was conducted in order to generate summary risk ratios. Results: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in terms of repellent active ingredient and formulation, co-interventions, study population, compliance, and follow-up period. Topical repellents showed an 18% protective efficacy against P. falciparum malaria, although this was not significant (95% CI:-8%, 38%). Similarly, the average protective efficacy of topical repellents against P. vivax malaria did not reach significance (protective efficacy: 20%, 95% CI:-37%, 53%). Exclusion of non-randomized trials from the meta-Analysis did not alter the findings. Conclusions: Although topical repellents can provide individual protection against mosquitoes, the results of this meta-Analysis indicate that topical repellents are unlikely to provide effective protection against malaria. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies included and the relatively small number of studies meant that this heterogeneity could not be fully explored in the analysis. Further well-designed trials of topical repellents at appropriate doses and alternative modes of repellent delivery, such as spatial repellents and long-lasting insecticide-Treated clothing, are required.",2014,2450,TRUE

Diflubenzuron at 0.1% active ingredient (AI, wt:wt) had no noticeable effect on termite populations. Chlorfluazuron (0.25% [AI]) significantly reduced termite populations in ≈3 yr. Chlorfluazuron used after >2-yr diflubenzuron treatment significantly reduced termite populations within months. This suggests diflubenzuron exposure increased the termite's sensitivity to chlorfluazuron accelerating population collapse. Hexaflumuron (0.5% [AI] ) also reduced termite populations in ≈2 yr. The process of removing most detectable termite populations from the ≈460,000-m 2 campus of the Southern Regional Research Center, New Orleans, LA, with CSIs baits required ≈3 yr. Adjustments in the specific bait formulations and application procedures might reduce time to suppression.

"Assessment of different inert dust formulations for the control of Sitophilus oryzae, Tribolium confusum and Aphis fabae",NO,47,Lisa,NO,Faliagka S.; Agrafioti P.; Lampiri E.; Katsoulas N.; Athanassiou C.G.,Crop Protection,"The necessity to ensure the quality of food by simultaneously reducing the environmental footprint due to the extensive use of convectional insecticides has led to an increase in the efforts towards the development of non-chemical control strategies. Silicon dioxide is considered as a promising alternative active ingredient for the control of various arthropods in different crops and products. Silicon dioxide and the relative silicaceous materials (silica) are classified in the category of inert dusts, which act on arthropods through contact leading to desiccation. In our study, we tested three different silica-based dust formulations, Sylobloc® S200, Syloid® ED3 and Syloid® ED5 in order to evaluate their pest control efficacy. As target species, we used, in laboratory bioassays, a field/greenhouse pest the aphid Aphis fabae and the stored-product pests Tribolium confusum and Sitophilus oryzae. These species were exposed to the aforementioned dusts under three different doses (0, 12.5, 25.0 mg/petri) and different time intervals. Taking into account the exposure time of the above species to the inert dusts, S. oryzae adults and T. confusum larvae were more susceptible to ED5 at 25.0 and 12.5 mg, respectively, while A. fabae adults to S200 at the highest tested dose, since less time was needed in order to achieve the highest mortality. Sitophilus oryzae and T. confusum mortality was increased to 90% after the 7th day of post exposure period to all dust formulations, while the highest mortality levels of A. fabae were recorded after 1 day of post exposure to S200. The results of this study show that these silicon dust formulations are effective to greenhouse and storage insect control and can be further exploited through various uses, e.g. in insect-proof nets to minimize the pest invasions in greenhouses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,2781,TRUE
Microemulsion formulation of carbendazim and its in vitro antifungal activities evaluation,NO,48,Lisa,NO,Leng P.; Zhang Z.; Li Q.; Zhao M.; Pan G.,PLoS ONE,"The fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn is a widespread and destructive plant pathogen with a very broad host range. Althoughvarious pathogens, including R. solani, have been traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides, their use faces drawbacks such as environmental pollution, development of pesticide resistance, and other negative effects. Carbendazim is a well-known antifungal agent capable of controlling a broad range of plant diseases, but its use is hampered by its poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we describe an environmentally friendly pharmaceutical microemulsion system using carbendazim as the active ingredient, chloroform and acetic acid as solvents, and the surfactants HSH and 0204 as emulsifiers. This system increased the solubility of carbendazim to 30 g/L. The optimal microemulsion formulation was determined based on a pseudo-ternary phase diagram; its physicochemical characteristics were also tested. The cloud point was greater than 90uC and it was resistant to freezing down to 218uC, both of which are improvements over the temperature range in which pure carbendazim can be used. This microemulsion meets the standard for pesticide microemulsions and demonstrated better activity against R. solani AG1-IA, relative to an aqueous solution of pure carbendazim (0.2 g/L). The mechanism of activity was reflected in the inhibition of against R. solani AG1-IA including mycelium growth, and sclerotia formation and germination were significantly better than that of 0.2 g/L carbendazim water solution according to the results of t-test done by SPSS 19. © 2014 Leng et al.",2014,2818,TRUE
Onion fly egg distribution in soil: a new sampling method and the effect of two granular insecticides,NO,49,Lisa,NO,Havukkala I.; Harris M.O.; Miller J.R.,Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata,"A method for rapidly determining the vertical and horizontal distribution of insect eggs in fragile soil is described. Liquefied agar is allowed to permeate intact soil samples from below; after cooling, the resulting solid is cut into thin sections, from which eggs can be recovered by washes with hot water. This technique revealed that in organic (muck) soil in the laboratory, undisturbed onion flies, Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), laid 95% of their eggs within a 10 mm diameter zone around the base of a surrogate onion ‘stem’ arising vertically from the soil. Ninety % of all eggs were found in the top 12 mm of soil, with an apparent maximum at depth of 2–4 mm. Increasing fly density from 30 to 200 flies per 30 × 30 × 42 cm cage flattened the horizontal distribution of eggs and extended the ovipositional range from c. 15 mm to beyond 60 mm, suggesting there was competition for the preferred ovipositional sites. Surface treatment of muck soil in the field by granular formulations of the insecticides Lorsban™15 G (active ingredient chlorpyrifos) and Dyfonate™15 G (fonofos) three weeks prior to bioassaying reduced egg‐laying at depths greater than 8 mm.

Global trends in pesticide formulation technology: The development of safer formulations in china,NO,50,Lisa,NO,Knowles A.,Outlooks on Pest Management,"Increasing attention is being paid to developing safer and more environmentally friendly pesticide formulations in more convenient packaging. Formulation technology is now seen as an enabling technology, which can add significant value and attractive presentations to pesticide products, and at the same time improve operator safety and reduce the dose rate and wastage of pesticides applied to crops, thereby reducing environmental impact and increasing food safety. The primary objectives of formulation technology are to optimise the biological activity of the pesticide, and to give a product which is safe and convenient for use. However, because of the wide variety of chemical pesticide active ingredients which are available, many different types of formulations have been developed depending mainly on the physicochemical properties of the active ingredients. In the past, most formulations were based on simple solutions in water (SL), emu lsifiable concentrates in a petroleum-based solvent (EC), or dusts (DP) and wettable powders (WP). The presence of petroleum-based solvents in EC formulations and dusty powders in DP and WP formulations can lead to safety hazards in use and a negative impa ct on the environment generally. These types of formulations are regarded now as 'old technology'. Most government regulatory authorities, including the Chinese Government, are now demanding formulations which are cleaner and safer for the user, have minim al impact on the environment, and can be applied at the lowest dose rate. This has led to the development of water-based liquid formulations such as suspension concentrates (SC), oil-in- water emulsions (EW) and microcapsules (CS). There has also been a mo ve away from dusty powders towards water dispersible or soluble granules (WG/SG). These developments in formulation technology and other novel formulation types, sometimes in special packaging such as water-soluble packs, can give products a competitive ad vantage, add value or extend the life-cycle of active ingredients. These types of formulations are regarded as 'new technology'. While much progress has been made towards new technology formulations in the USA, Europe and Japan, nearly all pesticide formulations in China were produced using the old technology until the early 1990s. From 1993 to 1999, a Pesticide Formulation Development Project was carried out under a United Nations programme with the cooperation of the Chinese Government at the Nantong Pest icide Formulation Centre (NPFC), Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. This paper describes the new pesticide formulations that were developed at Nantong, and how the new technology is being increasingly demanded by the Chinese regulatory authorities and intro duced by pesticide formulation companies in China. Some figures are presented to show how the pesticide market in China has now become one of the most important in the world, and how the market share is moving towards the safer formulations made by the new technology.

The 2,4-D or dicamba was extracted from sample tubes and quantified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Volatility from 2,4-D dimethylamine (DMA) was determined to be greater than that of 2,4-D choline in chambers where temperatures were held at 30 or 40 C and relative humidity (RH) was 20% or 50%.

Effects of surfactants and the kinetic energy of monodroplets on the deposit structure of glyphosate at the micro-scale and their relevance to herbicide bio-efficacy on selected weed species,NO,53,Lisa,NO,Basi S.; Hunsche M.; Noga G.,Weed Research,"Summary: The deposit pattern of foliar-applied agrochemicals, and its relation to their bio-efficacy, has major practical importance. Thus, in our experiments, we evaluated the relevance of the deposition properties of glyphosate for its bio-efficacy. The deposition pattern of glyphosate monodroplets was influenced by using surfactant and by applying the droplets with or without kinetic energy to the plant foliage. Monodroplets (1μL) of glyphosate, formulated with or without ethoxylated rapeseed oil surfactant (RSO) having on average 5, 10, 30 or 60 ethylene oxide units (EO), as well as one commercial glyphosate product (CGP), were applied either by carefully placing the droplet on the foliage with a pipette (kinetic energy assumed to be near zero) or by a monodroplet generator (with kinetic energy). We selected two easy-to-wet (Stellaria media and Viola arvensis) and two difficult-to-wet (Chenopodium album and Setaria viridis) weed species as target plants. The deposit structure was determined using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis. The kinetic energy of the droplet had no consistent effect on the deposit structure or the bio-efficacy of glyphosate formulations. In contrast, surfactants differing in EO unit, affected both the deposit structure and the bio-efficacy of the formulations, depending upon the species. In easy-to-wet species, the increase in EO unit of RSO surfactant failed to affect the deposit area of glyphosate and its bio-efficacy. However, in difficult-to-wet species, the increase in EO unit of RSO surfactant reduced the deposit area of glyphosate and enhanced its bio-efficacy. © 2012 European Weed Research Society.",2013,3427,TRUE

But, the additives may not have been tested as thoroughly as the chief ingredients. The surfactant, nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40), is an additive frequently present in pesticide formulations. We investigated the effects of NP40 and other constituents of a validamycin pesticide formulation on cell viability and on the expression of genes involved in cell damage pathways. Methods: The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Results: The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up- and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/ arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064). The 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene, within the heat shock protein/unfolded protein response category, showed the highest individual increase in expression (26.1-fold).

The In Vitro Genotoxic Effects of a Commercial Formulation of alpha-Cypermethrin in Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes,NO,56,Lisa,NO,"Kocaman, AY; Topaktas, M",ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS,"alpha-Cypermethrin, a highly active pyrethroid insecticide, is effective against a wide range of insects encountered in agriculture and animal husbandry. The potential genotoxicity of a commercial formulation of (x-cypermethrin (Fastac 100 EC, containing 10% alpha-cypermethrin as the active ingredient) on human peripheral lymphocytes was examined in vitro by sister chromatid exchange (SCIE), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and micronucleus (MN) tests. The human lymphocytes were treated with 5, 10, 15, and 20 mu g/ml of a-cypermethrin for 24- and 48-hr. alpha-Cypermethrin induced SCEs and CAs significantly at all concentrations and treatment times and MN formation was significantly induced at 5 and 10 mu g/ml of alpha-cypermethrin when compared with both the control and solvent control. Binuclear cells could not be detected sufficiently in the highest two concentration of alpha-cypermethrin (15 and 20 mu g/ml) for both the 24- and 48-hr treatment times. alpha-Cypermethrin decreased the proliferation index (PI) at three high concentrations (10, 15, and 20 mu g/ml) for both treatment periods as compared with the control groups. In addition, alpha-cypermethrin reduced both the mitotic index (MI) and nuclear division index (NDI) significantly at all concentrations for two treatment periods.

Lethal and sublethal effects of cypermethrin to Hypsiboas pulchellus tadpoles,YES,57,Lisa,YES,"Agostini, MG; Natale, GS; Ronco, AE",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"The study of the effects of the insecticide cypermethrin (CY) technical grade and its SherpaA (R) commercial formulation on Hypsiboas pulchellus tadpoles assessing lethality, behavior, growth, and abnormalities under standardized laboratory conditions is reported. Observed behaviors were identified and categorized by means of a ranking system according to the loss of mobility. Results of acute lethal effects indicate higher potency for SherpaA (R) at this level of assessment. All effects on behavior showed an increasing degree of injury as insecticide concentration increased. Organisms exposed to technical grade CY showed lower body length with respect to controls from 3.44 A mu g CY/L to higher concentrations, whereas those exposed to SherpaA (R) exhibited lower growth from 0.83 A mu g CY/L. Both forms of the tested insecticide caused abnormalities between 0.34 and 4.18 A mu g CY/L, but 100% of malformed individuals was detected from 34.4 A mu g CY/L for those exposed to the technical grade CY, and from 8.36 A mu g CY/L for those exposed to SherpaA (R). This study proposes the use of easily identifiable and distinguishable sublethal end-points. The high input loads of CY in natural environments, the detected concentrations in the field, in addition to the low levels of this insecticide required to induce sublethal effects (which could eventually lead to death), allow for the conclusion that the insecticide is a risk factor for amphibians inhabiting agroecosystems.",2010,3911,TRUE
Environmentally friendly slow release formulations of alachlor based on clay-phosphatidylcholine,NO,58,Lisa,NO,"Sanchez-Verdejo, T; Undabeytia, T; Nir, S; Maqueda, C; Morillo, E",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"A new clay-liposome complex was developed for reducing leaching of herbicides and contamination of groundwater. The liposomes were composed of the neutral and Environmental Protection Agency approved phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC). Adsorption of PC liposomes on the clay mineral montmorillonite could exceed the cation exchange capacity of the clay, and was well simulated by the Langmuir equation. X-ray diffraction results for 6 mM PC and 1.6 g/L clay (3 day incubation) yielded a basal spacing of 7.49 nm, which was interpreted as the formation of a supported planar bilayer on montmorillonite platelets. Fluorescence methods demonstrated structural changes which reflected adsorption of PC followed by loss of vesicle integrity as measured by the penetration of dithionite into the internal monolayer of fluorescently labeled liposomes, resulting in a decrease in fluorescence intensity to 18% of initial after 4 h. Energy transfer was demonstrated after 1 h from labeled liposomes to montmorillonite labeled by an acceptor. The neutral herbicide alachlor adsorbed on the liposome-clay complex, yielding a formulation of up to 40% active ingredient, and 1.6-fold reduction in herbicide release in comparison to the commercial formulation. Hence, the PC-montmorillonite complex can form a basis for environmentally friendly formulations of herbicides, which would yield reduced leaching.",2008,3944,TRUE

Four cohorts of juveniles (a total of 280 animals) were exposed for 4 wk to each one of three atrazine concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mg/L) or a control (0 mg/L), from a commercial formulation having 90% of active principle. At the end of the exposure, no significant (p > 0.05) differences in either mortality or molting were noted. However, the weight gain and the protein content of abdominal muscle decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the highest atrazine concentration as compared to control, indicating that atrazine acted as a relevant stressor, although at a concentration higher than those reported in the environment. Besides, the proportion of females increased progressively as the atrazine concentration increases, being significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of controls at the highest concentration assayed. Both macroscopic and histological analysis revealed a normal architecture of gonopores and gonads in both control and exposed animals. The obtained results strongly suggest that atrazine could be causing an endocrine disruption on the hormonal system responsible for the sexual differentiation of the studied species, increasing the proportion of female proportion without disturbing the gonad structure.

Signs of toxicity were evaluated by detection of locomotor dysfunction or death after exposure to concentrations of 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, and 100 mu g/L of Sonar (TM) and 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, 100, and 10 mu g/L of SonarA (R) AS in US EPA, moderately hard reconstituted water (MHRW). The median effective concentration (EC50) was 891 and 631 mu g/L for Sonar (TM) at 48 and 96 h and less than 10 mu g/L for SonarA (R) AS at 96 h. Increased duration of exposure to SonarA (R) AS from 48 to 96 h had a significant effect on increasing the rate of combined morbidity and mortality. At the lowest concentration of SonarA (R) AS tested, which is half the concentration allowed within 400 m of any functioning potable water intake for human usage, 40% of the mites were adversely affected at 48 h and 70% were affected after 96 h of exposure. This study demonstrates that SonarA (R) AS is 60-fold more toxic to water mites than the active ingredient alone. At currently acceptable application rates of 90-150 mu g/L fluridone, the addition of ingredients classified as inert, as in SonarA (R) AS, result in an increased risk of adverse effects on populations of male water mites (Arrenurus: Megaluracarus) in aquatic ecosystems.",2011,4002,TRUE

This study investigated the impact of parental and direct exposure to 1 mu gL-1 of glyphosate using the AS alone or one of two GBH formulations (i.e. Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Jardin (R)) in the early developmental stages of rainbow trout. Three different modes of exposure on the F1 generation were studied: (1) intergenerational (i.e. fish only exposed through their parents); (2) direct (i.e. fish exposed only directly) and (3) multigenerational (i.e. fish both exposed intergenerationally and directly). The impact of chemical treatments on embryo-larval development (survival, biometry and malformations), swimming behaviour, biochemical markers of oxidative stress equilibrium (TBARS and catalase), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and energy metabolism (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome-c oxidase, CCO; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH) was explored. Chemical exposure did not affect the survival of F1 embryos or malformation rates. Direct exposure to the AS induced some biometric changes, such as reduction in head size (with a 10% decrease in head length), independently of coformulants. Intergenerational exposure to the AS or the Roundup GBH increased swimming activity of the larvae, with increase of between 78 and 102% in travel speeds. Viaglif co-formulants appear to have counteracted this behavioural change. The minor changes detected in the assayed biochemical markers suggested that observed effects were not due to oxidative damage, AChE inhibition or alterations to energy metabolism. Nonetheless, multi- and intergenerational exposure to Roundup increased CS:CCO and LDH:CS ratios by 46% and 9%, respectively, with a potential modification of the aerobic-to-anaerobic energy production balance. These biochemical effects were not correlated with those observed on individual level of biological organization. Therefore, further studies on generational toxicity of glyphosate and its co-formulants are needed to identify the other mechanisms of glyphosate toxicity at the cellular level.",2021,4069,TRUE

To assess the distribution and fate of one of these pesticides (coumaphos), two experimental hives were treated with Perizin ( the commercial product containing the active ingredient coumaphos). Samples of honey, wax, pollen, adult bees and larvae taken before treatment and up to 104 days afterwards, showed diffuse contamination. Wood hedges and wax bridges, where the pesticide solution was applied, were analysed as well. A mass balance was calculated, yielding a recovered amount of around 60% just after treatment and 38% 1 month later. Directly contaminated surfaces and wax contained the highest amount of residues. Wax and honey contained different amounts ( 10, and 0.1% respectively) but both retained residues for long time. Bees ingest most of the product just after treatment, then rapidly eliminate it by metabolism, advection and deposition processes. On the basis of analytical results, a simple model ( level I of the fugacity model) was applied to the hive system for different pesticides ( coumaphos, malathion,. uvalinate and bromopropylate).

CHARACTERIZING PESTICIDE AND SURFACTANT PENETRATION WITH ISOLATED PLANT CUTICLES,NO,64,Lisa,NO,"BUKOVAC, MJ; PETRACEK, PD",PESTICIDE SCIENCE,"A survey is presented of the use of isolated leaf and fruit cuticles in studying foliar penetration. Isolated cuticles, which represent the prime barrier to penetration, provide a physical system with which transport studies can be conducted under well-defined and highly controlled conditions while avoiding the physiological effects of biologically active compounds on the system. Most studies with isolated cuticles have focused on sorption, desorption and infinite-dose cuticular transport of compounds in aqueous systems. Partition coefficients can be calculated for pesticides from sorption data, thereby yielding information on the solubility of the compounds in the cuticle. Permeance and diffusion coefficients can be calculated from cuticular transport studies. These transport parameters provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cuticular penetration. Further, they are useful in comparing both the penetration characteristics of selected compounds and permeability of cuticles. Transport systems, using isolated cuticles, may be used to quantify the effects of spray additives on pesticide penetration. A finite-dose system is described that may be useful in studying spray droplet/deposit interactions with the cuticle and, concurrently, following transcuticular penetration from droplets/deposits on the surface. These systems may prove useful in optimizing spray formulations and spray parameters, leading to more efficient pesticide development and application.",1993,4226,TRUE
Essential oils from Ocimum basilicum cultivars: analysis of their composition and determination of the effect of the major compounds on Haemonchus contortus eggs,NO,65,Lisa,NO,"Sousa, AIP; Silva, CR; Costa, HN; Silva, NCS; Pinto, JAO; Blank, AF; Soares, AMS; Costa, LM",JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY,"The continuous use of synthetic anthelmintics against gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) has resulted in the increased resistance, which is why alternative methods are being sought, such as the use of natural products. Plant essential oils (EOs) have been considered as potential products for the control of GINs. However, the chemical composition and, consequently, the biological activity of EOs vary in different plant cultivars. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of EOs from cultivars of Ocimum basilicum L. and that of their major constituents against Haemonchus contortus. The EOs from 16 cultivars as well the pure compound linalool, methyl chavicol, citral and eugenol were used in the assessment of the inhibition of H. contortus egg hatch. In addition, the composition of three cultivars was simulated using a combination of the two major compounds from each. The EOs from different cultivars showed mean Inhibition Concentration (IC50) varying from 0.56 to 2.22 mg/mL. The cultivar with the highest egg-hatch inhibition, Napoletano, is constituted mainly of linalool and methyl chavicol. Among the individual compounds tested, citral was the most effective (IC50 0.30 mg/mL). The best combination of compounds was obtained with 11% eugenol plus 64% linalool (IC50 0.44 mg/mL), simulating the Italian Large Leaf (Richters) cultivar. We conclude that different cultivars of O. basilicum show different anthelmintic potential, with cultivars containing linalool and methyl chavicol being the most promising; and that citral or methyl chavicol isolated should also be considered for the development of new anthelmintic formulations.",2021,4261,TRUE
Plants in the Genus Tephrosia: Valuable Resources for Botanical Insecticides,NO,66,Lisa,NO,"Zhang, PW; Qin, DQ; Chen, JJ; Zhang, ZX",INSECTS,"Simple Summary There is an increasing interest in botanical insecticides worldwide. Plants from the genus Tephrosia are rich in bioactive phytochemicals, particularly rotenoids which include rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin. Rotenoids have strong insecticidal activities against a wider range of pests. However, there has been no treatise thus far focusing on Tephrosia as insecticidal plants. This article is intended to review phytochemicals produced by selected species, their insecticidal activities, and the current status on the use of Tephrosia as botanical insecticidal plants for insect pest control. Synthetic insecticides are effective in controlling insect pests but can also harm nontarget organisms and the environment. During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative insecticides, particularly those derived from plants, commonly known as botanical insecticides. However, commercially available botanical insecticides remain limited. Rotenone is one of the earliest identified compounds and was used as fish poison and pest management. Due to its link with Parkinson disease, the use of rotenone was banned in many developed countries. Rotenone used to be isolated from Derris spp. and Lonchocarpus spp., and it can also be isolated from Tephrosia species. In this article, we present basic botanical information on selected Tephrosia species and their major compounds related to insecticidal activities and highlight the current use of extracts derived from some species, Tephrosia vogelii in particular, for control of insect pests in stored grains and crop production. The crude extracts contain multiple bioactive compounds, mainly rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin, which act in either additive or synergistic fashion, resulting in effective control of insect pests. There are about 400 species in the genus Tephrosia, and species and even strains or variants vary greatly in these active compounds. We argue that a systematic evaluation of bioactive compounds in different species are needed, and species or strains with high insecticidal activities should be selected for use in the sustainable control of insect pests.",2020,4358,TRUE

The asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins is an important approach for synthesizing optically active epoxides, and thus is widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and perfumes. Chiral salen Mn(III) complexes have demonstrated activities and selectivities for the enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins under homogeneous conditions. Compared with the homogeneous asymmetric catalysts, the heterogeneous ones have the advantages of easy catalyst/product separation and simple catalyst recycling. And more and more interests have been focused on the studies of heterogenization of chiral complexes. New types of supported catalysts are obtained by anchoring chiral salen Mn(III) complex on a series of phenoxy-modified aluminium poly(styrene-phenylvinylphosphonate)-phosphate (AIPS-PVPA) in the text. All the prepared catalysts are characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis, XPS, SEM, TG and elemental analysis. The catalytic capabilities are investigated with m-CPBA as an oxidant and with indene and a-methylstyrene as substrates for asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins. The supported catalysts indicate superior catalytic activities in the asymmetric epoxidation of a-methylstyrene and indene with m-CPBA as oxidative system, compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst (ee, >97% vs. 54% and >99% vs. 65%). The steric properties of the linkages really play vital impacts on the configuration of the transition state for the asymmetric reactions. Contrary to most of the literatures reported, the results show that the heterogeneous catalysts 3a similar to 3d exhibit excellent catalytic activities, and their conversions and ee values increase remarkably in the absence of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) under the same catalytic conditions. The structures of the immobilized catalysts similar to the N-oxide ligand act as axial ligands leading to the unusual phenomenon. Simultaneously, additives are generally regarded as axial ligands on the transition metal catalyst, which make for activating the catalyst either toward oxidation or toward reactivity with the olefin. Thus, there is a steric hindrance when the N-oxide ligand is added and the optimal geometric configuration of the reactive intermediate salen Mn(V)=O was altered. It is steric hindrance that makes olefins approaching salen Mn(V)=O difficult and lower ee values are obtained. Furthermore, these catalysts are easily separated and are relatively stable and reused nine times without significant loss of activities.",2017,4421,TRUE
Effects of co-formulants on the absorption and secretion of active substances in plant protection products in vitro,YES,68,Lisa,YES,"Karaca, M; Fischer, BC; Willenbockel, CT; Tralau, T; Marx-Stoelting, P; Bloch, D",ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY,"Currently, the authorisation process for plant protection products (PPPs) relies on the testing of acute and topological toxicity only. Contrastingly, the evaluation of active substances includes a more comprehensive set of toxicity studies. Nevertheless, mixture effects of active ingredients and co-formulants may result in increased toxicity. Therefore, we investigated effects of surface active co-formulants on the toxicity of two PPPs focussing on qualitative and quantitative toxicokinetic effects on absorption and secretion. The respective products are based on the active substances abamectin and fluroxypyr-meptyl and were tested for cytotoxicity in the presence or absence of the corresponding surfactants and co-formulants using Caco-2 cells. In addition, the effect of co-formulants on increased cellular permeation was quantified using LC-MS/MS, while potential kinetic mixture effects were addressed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements and ATPase assays. The results show that surface active co-formulants significantly increase the cytotoxicity of the investigated PPPs, leading to more than additive mixture effects. Moreover, analytical investigations show higher efflux ratios of both active substances and the metabolite fluroxypyr upon combination with certain concentrations of the surfactants. The results further point to a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of Pgp transporters by most of the surfactants as well as to increased membrane fluidity. Altogether, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that surfactants contribute to increased cytotoxicity of PPPs and do so by increasing the bioavailability of the respective active substances.",2021,4470,TRUE

Terpinen-4-ol is the Most Active Ingredient of Tea Tree Oil to Kill Demodex Mites,NO,70,Lisa,NO,"Tighe, S; Gao, YY; Tseng, SCG",TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Purpose: To determine the active ingredient in tea tree oil (TTO) responsible for its reported killing effect on Demodex mites, the most common ectoparasite found in the human skin extending to the eye. Methods: Using a reported in vitro killing assay to measure the survival time of adult Demodex folliculorum up to 150 minutes, we have screened serial concentrations of 13 of the 15 known ingredients of TTO (ISO4730: 2004) that were soluble in mineral oil and examined their synergistic relationships in killing mites. The most potent ingredient was then tested for its efficacy in killing Demodex in vivo. Results: All ingredients exhibited a dose-dependent killing effect. Besides Terpinen-4ol, the order of relative potency did not correlate with the order of relative abundance in TTO for the remaining 12 ingredients. Terpinen-4-ol was the most potent ingredient followed by a-Terpineol, 1,8-Cineole and Sabinene. Terpinen-4-ol, the most abundant ingredient in TTO, was more potent than TTO at equivalent concentrations and its killing effect was even observable at a mere concentration of 1%. Terpinen-4-ol exhibited a significant synergistic effect with Terpinolene, but an antagonistic effect with a-Terpineol in killing mites (both P<0.05). In vivo, Terpinen-4-ol was shown to eradicate mites. Conclusions: The above finding suggests that deployment of Terpinen-4-ol alone should enhance its potency in killing Demodex mites by reducing the adverse and antagonistic effects from other ingredients in TTO. Translational Relevance: Terpinen-4-ol can be adopted in future formulations of acaricides to treat a number of ocular and cutaneous diseases caused by demodicosis.",2013,4717,TRUE

According to the results of release experiments in water, the CM-chit/H-bent composite carrier showed double advantages of both encapsulation by the polymer and sorption by the bentonite. The time taken for 50 % of active ingredients to be released, t(50), was prolonged to 572 h for atrazine and 24 h for imidacloprid, respectively.

Of the 27 pesticides monitored, only 19 were detected in Australian stormwater, five of which (diuron, MCPA, 2,4-D, simazine, and triclopyr) were found in >50% of samples. Overall, stormwater pesticide concentrations were lower than reported in other countries (including the United States, Canada and Europe), and exceedances of public health and aquatic ecosystem standards were rare (<10% of samples). Spatiotemporal patterns were investigated with principal component analysis. Although stormwater pesticide composition was relatively stable across seasons and years, it varied significantly by catchment. Common pesticide.associations appear to reflect 1) user application,of common registered formulations containing characteristic suites of active ingredients, and 2) pesticide fate properties (e.g., environmental mobility and persistence).

In distilled water and in PEG-containing solutions displaying -0.1 MPa potential and up, the beads imbibe water and swell. The ensuing increase in weight is about 5%, and the increase in the bead's diameter is about 10%. At water potentials of -0.5 MPa and lower, loss of weight and shrinkage of the beads were observed. The changes in weight and diameter of the alginate-clay beads incubated in a Hamra loamy sand soil at 26.5% moisture content (w/w; -0.18 MPa) were similar to those observed in PEG solutions of > -0.5 MPa moisture potential. The weight and diameter losses observed in the drier soils (12.0 and 7.1% water content; -0.49 and -1.11 MPa) were similar to those in the more concentrated PEG solutions. A decrease in the rate of release of the active ingredient from the beads into soil was observed as the water potential decreased (drier soils).

Size selectivity of aqueous pores in stomatous cuticles of Vicia faba leaves,NO,76,Lisa,NO,"Schlegel, TK; Schonherr, J; Schreiber, L",PLANTA,"Size selectivity of aqueous pores in Vicia leaf cuticles was investigated by measuring the penetration of calcium salts into the abaxial surface of detached leaves. Molecular weights of salts ranged from 111 g mol(-1) to 755 g mo(-1). Penetration in light at 20 degrees C and 100% humidity was a first order process and rate constants of penetration ranged from 0.39 h(-1)(CaCl2) to 0.058 h(-1)supercript stop (Ca-lactobionate). Penetration was a first order process in the dark as well, but the rate constants were smaller by a factor of 1.82. Plotting logarithmatised rate constants versus anhydrous molecular weights resulted in straight lines both in light and in the dark. The slopes per hour were very similar and the average slope was -1.2x10(-3) mol g(-1). Hence, size selectivity was not affected by stomatal opening, and in light or darkness permeability of Vicia cuticles decreased by a factor of 2.9 when molecular weight increased from 100 g mol(-1) to 500 g mol(-1). Silver nitrate was preferentially precipitated as silver chloride in guard cells, glandular trichomes and at the base of trichomes. It was concluded that these precipitates mark the location of aqueous pores in Vicia leaf cuticles. The size selectivity of aqueous pores in Vicia leaf cuticles is small compared to that observed in poplar leaf cuticles, in which permeability decreased by a factor of 7-13 for the same range of molecular weights. It is also much smaller than size selectivity of the lipophilic pathway in cuticles. These findings suggest that active ingredients of pesticides, growth regulators and chemical inducers with high molecular weights penetrate leaves at higher rates when formulated as ions.",2005,5248,TRUE
Development of stimuli-responsive nano-based pesticides: emerging opportunities for agriculture,NO,77,Lisa,NO,"Camara, MC; Campos, EVR; Monteiro, RA; Pereira, ADS; Proenca, PLD; Fraceto, LF",JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY,"Pesticides and fertilizers are widely used to enhance agriculture yields, although the fraction of the pesticides applied in the field that reaches the targets is less than 0.1%. Such indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides is disadvantageous due to the cost implications and increasing human health and environmental concerns. In recent years, the utilization of nanotechnology to create novel formulations has shown great potential for diminishing the indiscriminate use of pesticides and providing environmentally safer alternatives. Smart nano-based pesticides are designed to efficiently delivery sufficient amounts of active ingredients in response to biotic and/or abiotic stressors that act as triggers, employing targeted and controlled release mechanisms.

Evaluation of Two Formulations of Chlorantraniliprole as Maize Protectants for the Management of Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae),NO,78,Lisa,NO,"Boukouvala, MC; Kavallieratos, NG",INSECTS,"Simple Summary Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) is a major insect pest of stored maize and dried tubers of cassava, but also a wood-boring species. In the current study, we evaluated two chlorantraniliprole formulations, WG (wettable granule) and SC (suspension concentrate), as maize protectants against P. truncatus adults at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Both formulations performed similarly. The highest mortality was noted in chlorantraniliprole WG, at 10 ppm and 30 degrees C (98.9%), followed by chlorantraniliprole SC (96.1%), at the same dose and temperature. WG formulation was more effective at 10 ppm and 25 degrees C (92.8%) than SC formulation (89.4%). No progeny production was noted on maize treated the WG formulation at 20 and 30 degrees C. The SC formulation caused complete offspring suppression at 10 ppm at all three tested temperatures. The results indicate that chlorantraniliprole is an effective compound with a high insecticidal activity against T. truncatus that depends on temperature, dose and exposure. The larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) is one of the most destructive insect pests of stored maize and dried tubers of cassava, and a wood-boring species. In the present study, we examined two chlorantraniliprole formulations, WG (wettable granule) with 350 g/kg active ingredient (a.i.) and SC (suspension concentrate) with 200 g/L a.i., as maize protectants against P. truncatus adults. Chlorantraniliprole formulations were applied as solutions at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm, and tested at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Both formulations performed similarly. After 7 days of exposure, the overall mortality provided by both formulations was very low (<17%). Seven days later, mortality was remarkably increased on maize treated with 1 and 10 ppm at 25 and 30 degrees C for both formulations. The highest mortality was noted in chlorantraniliprole WG, at 10 ppm and 30 degrees C (98.9%), followed by chlorantraniliprole SC (96.1%), at the same dose and temperature. WG formulation was more effective at 10 ppm and 25 degrees C (92.8%) than SC formulation (89.4%). No progeny production was noted on maize treated with the WG formulation at 20 and 30 degrees C. The SC formulation caused complete offspring suppression at 10 ppm at all three tested temperatures. The results of the present work indicate that chlorantraniliprole is an effective compound with a high insecticidal activity against T. truncatus on stored maize that depends on temperature, dose and exposure interval. The fact that chlorantraniliprole is a broad-spectrum insecticide, exhibiting low toxicity to mammals and beneficial arthropods, could be a valuable management tool in storage facilities.",2021,5348,TRUE
Metabolomics reveals differential mechanisms of toxicity of hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine)-derived nanoparticles to the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb,NO,79,Lisa,NO,"Lykogianni, M; Papadopoulou, EA; Sapalidis, A; Tsiourvas, D; Sideratou, Z; Aliferis, KA",PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"There is a consensus on the urge for the discovery and assessment of alternative, improved sources of bioactivity that could be developed as plant protection products (PPPs), in order to combat issues that the agrochemical sector is facing. Based on the recent advances in nanotechnology, nanoparticles seem to have a great potential towards the development of the next generation nano-PPPs used as active ingredients (a.i.) per se or as nanocarriers in their formulation. Nonetheless, information on their mode(s)-of-action (MoA) and mechanisms of toxicity is yet largely unknown, representing a bottleneck in their further assessment and development. Therefore, we have undertaken the task to assess the fungitoxicity of hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (HPEI), quaternized hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (QPEI), and guanidinylated hyperbranched poly (ethyleneimine) (GPEI) nanoparticles to the soil-born plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb, and dissect their effects on its metabolism applying GC/EI/MS metabolomics. Results revealed that functionalization of HPEI nanoparticles with guanidinium end groups (GPEI) increases their toxicity to V. dahliae, while functionalization with quaternary ammonium end groups (QPEI) decreases it. The treatments with the nanoparticles affected the chemical homeostasis of the fungus, altering substantially its amino acid pool, energy production, and fatty acid content, causing additionally oxidative and osmotic stresses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the comparative toxicity of HPEI, QPEI, and GPEI to filamentous fungi applying metabolomics. The findings could be exploited in the study of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of HPEI-derived nanoparticles and their further development as nano-PPPs.",2020,5403,TRUE
In vitro larvicidal efficacy of flystrike dressings against the Australian sheep blowfly,NO,80,Lisa,NO,"Levot, GW; Sales, N; Barchia, I",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,"The abilities of 14 registered flystrike products to prevent development of Australian sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina) larvae were measured by laboratory bioassay. Larvae were exposed to the products for periods ranging from 5 to 180 s. Most products were quite effective against susceptible-strain larvae but less effective in field strains due to organophosphate resistance. Some products killed fewer than 20% of field larvae, even after 180 s exposure. However, field strain and susceptible-strain L. cuprina were equally likely to succumb after thorough exposure to a powder formulation of diazinon or to products containing ivermectin or cyromazine. Most products had no obvious effects on larvae until 2-8 h after treatment. Exceptions were non-aqueous, ready to use formulations such as Kleendok with diazinon, Defiance S and Coopers Flystrike Powder. In the cases of Kleendok with diazinon and Defiance S it is likely that formulation components other than the active ingredient were responsible for the fast action. Of the aqueous organophosphate formulation products Supona, containing chlorfenvinphos, was the fastest acting. Greater proportions of susceptible larvae responded over time but among field larvae that responded initially, there were some that recovered within 24 h. Increasing concern over insecticide residues in wool following jetting (topical treatment) of whole sheep, has placed greater reliance on dressing products to control flystrike. With so few effective products available there is a ready market for fast-acting, efficacious products.",1999,5412,TRUE

A. Juss) against two serious pest species of stored products, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), through nano -emulsion formulations. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed consisting of an emulsion system of an active ingredient (neem oil), surfactant (polysorbate or alkylpolyglucoside), and water. Isotropic regions were formed in the pseudoternary phase diagrams, and four formulations were selected from the isotropic regions and characterized according to particle size, particle aging, zeta potential, stability and thermostability, surface tension, viscosity, and pH. The selected formulations showed particle sizes of 208-507 nm in diameter. The result of contact toxicity demonstrated excellent mortality of S. oryzae and T castaneum adults, with a mortality range of 85100% and 74-100%, respectively, at a 1% azadirachtin concentration after only 2 days of exposure.

Development of an attract-and-kill co-formulation containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae and neem extract attractive towards wireworms,NO,82,Lisa,NO,"Humbert, P; Vemmer, M; Mavers, F; Schumann, M; Vidal, S; Patel, AV",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUNDWireworms (Coleoptera: Elateridae) are major insect pests of worldwide relevance. Owing to the progressive phasing-out of chemical insecticides, there is great demand for innovative control options. This study reports on the development of an attract-and-kill co-formulation based on Ca-alginate beads, which release CO2 and contain neem extract as a bioinsecticidal compound. The objectives of this study were to discover: (1) whether neem extract can be immobilized efficiently, (2) whether CO2-releasing Saccharomyces cerevisiae and neem extract are suitable for co-encapsulation, and (3) whether co-encapsulated neem extract affects the attractiveness of CO2-releasing beads towards wireworms. RESULTSNeem extract was co-encapsulated together with S. cerevisiae, starch and amyloglucosidase with a high encapsulation efficiency of 98.6% (based on measurement of azadirachtin A as the main active ingredient). Even at enhanced concentrations, neem extract allowed growth of S. cerevisiae, and beads containing neem extract exhibited CO2-emission comparable with beads without neem extract. When applied to the soil, the beads established a CO2 gradient of >15 cm. The co-formulation containing neem extract showed no repellent effects and was attractive for wireworms within the first 24 h after exposure. CONCLUSIONCo-encapsulation of S. cerevisiae and neem extract is a promising approach for the development of attract-and-kill formulations for the control of wireworms. This study offers new options for the application of neem extracts in soil. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2018,5423,TRUE

Dissipation study of the fungicides on mango was carried out after giving applications of fluopyram +tebuconazole at the standard and double doses of 150+150 and 300+300g active ingredient hectare(-1) (g a.i. ha(-1)), respectively. Fluopyram residues on mango were 0.8 and 0.9mg kg(-1) and tebuconazole residues, 0.308 and 0.4mg kg(-1) after three and four applications at the standard dose. At double dose treatment the residue levels for fluopyram were 1.266 and 1.453mg kg(-1) and tebuconazole, 0.681 and 0.853mg kg(-1), respectively. Residue dissipation in mango fruits followed first order rate kinetics and the half-life (DT50) were 4.3-5.4days for fluopyram and 3-3.8days for tebuconazole. Faster dissipation of the fungicides was observed after the fourth treatment which directly correlated to higher rainfall during that period. The combined residues of fluopyram+tebuconazole reduced to below their maximum residue limits (MRLs) within 36-38days. Dietary risk assessment on human health indicated that fluopyram and tebuconazole application to mango is unlikely to pose risk to human beings.

"Synthetic and Natural Insecticides: Gas, Liquid, Gel and Solid Formulations for Stored-Product and Food-Industry Pest Control",NO,84,Lisa,NO,"Stejskal, V; Vendl, T; Aulicky, R; Athanassiou, C",INSECTS,"Simple Summary Currently, there is great global research interest in the use of novel methods of protection against agricultural, storage, and urban pests, particularly in the use of botanical substances and nontoxic materials. To ensure efficacy and safety, botanical and synthetic insecticides must be properly formulated and delivered in a species-specific way to their pest targets. The wide diversity of pests and environments-globally occurring at farms and food industry facilities-has inevitably resulted in a massive proliferation of application formulations and approaches. Although there are excellent summaries on particular aspects of the usage of synthetic and botanical pesticides, a general overview of application formulations on stored-product and food-associated pests is not currently available. This review provides an inventory of current and historical pesticide formulations. Its structure follows the traditional insecticide categorization based on four physical formulation types: gas, liquid, gel/foam, and solid. The review documents renewed research interest in optimizing traditional methods, such as insecticide baits, aerosols, sprays, fumigants, and inert gases, as well as the feasibility of integrating these methods with natural insecticides and physical measures (e.g., low temperatures) as combined application approaches. Several emerging technologies of pesticide formulations have been identified; they include electrostatic dusts or sprays, nanoparticles, hydrogels, inert baits with synthetic attractants, biodegradable cyanogenic protective coatings of grain, and RNA-based gene silencing compounds encapsulated in baits. Traditional and new formulations of natural compounds, including inert dust (diatomaceous earth) and botanicals (essential oils), have been considered as non-synthetic chemical control solutions for organic food production in developed countries and as affordable home-made insecticides in developing countries. The authors hope that the general coverage and extensive photographic documentation will make this review useful not only for scientists but also for students and practitioners. The selective application of insecticides is one of the cornerstones of integrated pest management (IPM) and management strategies for pest resistance to insecticides. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of the traditional and new methods for the application of gas, liquid, gel, and solid physical insecticide formulations to control stored-product and food industry urban pests from the taxa Acarina, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, and Zygentoma. Various definitions and concepts historically and currently used for various pesticide application formulations and methods are also described. This review demonstrates that new technological advances have sparked renewed research interest in the optimization of conventional methods such as insecticide aerosols, sprays, fumigants, and inert gases. Insect growth regulators/disruptors (IGRs/IGDs) are increasingly employed in baits, aerosols, residual treatments, and as spray-residual protectants for long-term stored-grain protection. Insecticide-impregnated hypoxic multilayer bags have been proven to be one of the most promising low-cost and safe methods for hermetic grain storage in developing countries. Insecticide-impregnated netting and food baits were originally developed for the control of urban/medical pests and have been recognized as an innovative technology for the protection of stored commodities. New biodegradable acaricide gel coatings and nets have been suggested for the protection of ham meat. Tablets and satchels represent a new approach for the application of botanicals. Many emerging technologies can be found in the form of impregnated protective packaging (insect growth regulators/disruptors (IGRs/IGDs), natural repellents), pheromone-based attracticides, electrostatic dust or sprays, nanoparticles, edible artificial sweeteners, hydrogels, inert baits with synthetic attractants, biodegradable encapsulations of active ingredients, and cyanogenic protective grain coatings. Smart pest control technologies based on RNA-based gene silencing compounds incorporated into food baits stand at the forefront of current strategic research. Inert gases and dust (diatomaceous earth) are positive examples of alternatives to synthetic pesticide products, for which methods of application and their integration with other methods have been proposed and implemented in practice. Although many promising laboratory studies have been conducted on the biological activity of natural botanical insecticides, published studies demonstrating their effective industrial field usage in grain stores and food production facilities are scarce. This review shows that the current problems associated with the application of some natural botanical insecticides (e.g., sorption, stability, field efficacy, and smell) to some extent echo problems that were frequently encountered and addressed almost 100 years ago during the transition from ancient to modern classical chemical pest control methods.",2021,5445,TRUE

Its main aim was to develop and investigate slow-release formulations of herbicides (metribuzin, tribenuron-methyl, and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl) of different structure, solubility, and specificity, which were loaded into a degradable matrix of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P(3HB)) blended with available natural materials (peat, clay, and wood flour). RESULTS Differences in the structure and physicochemical properties of the formulations were studied depending on the type of the matrix. Herbicide release and accumulation in soil were associated with the solubility of the herbicide. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that no chemical bonds were formed between the components in the experimental formulations. Degradation of the formulations in agro-transformed soil in laboratory conditions was chiefly influenced by the shape of the specimens (granules or pellets) while the effect of the type of filler (peat, clay, or wood flour) was insignificant. The use of granules enabled more rapid accumulation of the herbicides in soil: their peak concentrations were reached after 3 weeks of incubation while the concentrations of the herbicides released from the pellets were the highest after 5-7 weeks. Loading of the herbicides into the polymer matrix composed of the slowly degraded P(3HB) and natural materials enabled both sustained function of the formulations in soil (lasting between 1.5 and >= 3 months) and stable activity of the otherwise rapidly inactivated herbicides such as tribenuron-methyl and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. CONCLUSION The experimental herbicide formulations enabled slow release of the active ingredients to soil. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2020,5468,TRUE

Materials and methods Newly hatched snails were exposed for 168 days to soil and/or food contaminated with a formulation of glyphosate (BypassA (R)) or glufosinate (BastaA (R)) at the recommended field doses and also at 10-fold this dose. Results and discussion Herbicide degradation patterns showed that snails were mainly exposed during the first 28 days. The DT50 of glyphosate and glufosinate was established at 10.6 and 3.7 days, respectively. No significant effects on survival and growth were determined. Concerning genital tract maturation of the snails, exposure to herbicides tended to decrease the development of the albumen gland (inhibition of 43.5 +/- 32.8%). The presence of glyphosate (6 mg kg(-1) dry weight) was demonstrated in snails exposed continuously to this active ingredient at the highest concentration in their food. Conclusions These results showed a low effect of herbicides at relevant concentrations in soil but the detection of residues in tissues indicated a potential risk of transfer to the food chain. This chronic toxicity bioassay could complete the available tests to assess toxicity of contaminants, and more particularly pesticides, in soil.",2011,5477,TRUE

However, high volatility and moderate toxicity of this sulfide limit its application. To address these issues, a novel controlled release formulation of DMDS was proposed employing multiple emulsions and polyurea microcapsules (DMDS@MEs-MCs). The successful combination of the two technologies was revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared. According to the multiple encapsulation structure, the encapsulation efficiency decreased by only 3.13% after thermal storage, compared with a 15.21% decrease of microcapsules made with only a monolayer film. DMDS@MEs-MCs could effectively control the release of active ingredient, which increased applicator and environmental safety during application. Moreover, it could be facilely used by spraying and drip irrigation instead of a special fumigation device. The innovative formulation exhibited better control efficacy on soil pathogens (Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp.) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) than DMDS technical concentration (DMDS TC). In addition, it did not inhibit seed germination after 10 days when the plastic film was removed from the fumigated soil.

Field-scale pesticide volatilization involves the interaction of a number of complex variables. There is a need to acquire pesticide volatilization fluxes from a location where several of these variables can be held constant. Accordingly, soil properties, tillage practices, surface residue management, and pesticide formulations were held constant while fundamental information regarding metolachlor volatilization (a pre-emergent pesticide) was monitored over a five-year period as influenced by meteorological variables and soil water content. Metolachlor vapor concentrations were measured continuously for 120 h after each application using polyurethane foam plugs in a logarithmic profile above the soil surface. A flux gradient technique was used to compute volatilization fluxes from metolachlor concentration profiles and turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor (as determined from eddy covariance measurements). Differences in meteorological conditions and surface soil water contents resulted in variability of the volatilization losses over the years studied. The peak volatilization losses for each year occurred during the first 24 h after application with a maximum flux rate in 2001 (1500 ng m(-2) s(-1)) associated with wet surface soil conditions combined with warm temperatures. The cumulative volatilization losses for the 120-hour period following metolachlor application varied over the years from 5 to 25% of the applied active ingredient, with approximately 87% of the losses occurring during the first 72 h. In all of the years studied, volatilization occurred diurnally and accounted for between 43 and 86% during the day and 14 and 57% during the night of the total measured loss.

Further, we compared these results with those induced by the combination of the mussel and technical-grade glyphosate. We carried out a 34-day experiment in outdoor mesocosms, applying the following six treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), the equivalent concentration of glyphosate in Roundup Max (R) (R), 100 mussels (M), the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade or formulated form (MG and MR, respectively), and control (C). Herbicides significantly increased total phosphorus in water; R and MR showed greater initial total nitrogen and ammonium. R increased picoplankton abundance and caused an eightfold increase in phytoplankton, with high turbidity values; G had a lower effect on these variables.

Therefore, making assumptions about the toxicity of formulated and unformulated products is ill advised.",2022,5742,TRUE
Analytical methods for biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides: a review,NO,93,Lisa,NO,"Barr, DB; Needham, LL",JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES,"Synthetic pesticides have been used since in the early to mid twentieth century. In the US alone, over 800 pesticide active ingredients are formulated in about 21000 different commercial products. Although many public health benefits have been realized by the use of pesticides, their potential impact on the environment and public health is substantial. For risk assessment studies, exposure assessment is an integral component, which has unfortunately, often been weak or missing. In the past several decades, researchers have proposed to fill these missing data gaps using biological monitoring of specific markers related to exposures. In this paper, we present a review of existing analytical methodology for the biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides. We also present a critical assessment of the existing methodology and explore areas in which more research is needed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",2002,5878,TRUE
Effects of 'inactive' ingredients on bees,NO,94,Lisa,YES,"Mullin, CA",CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE,"Honey bees are sensitive to widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals, and evaluation of the role of these 'inerts or inactives' in pollinator decline is only in its formative stages. Lack of disclosure of formulation ingredients in major products and lack of adequate methods for their analysis constrain the assessment of total chemical load and agrochemical exposures on bees. Most studies to document pesticide effects on honey bees are performed without the formulation or other relevant spray adjuvant components used to environmentally apply the toxicant. Formulations are generally more toxic than active ingredients, particularly fungicides, by up to 26,000-fold based on published literature. Some 'inactive' candidates for future risk assessment for pollinators include the organosilicone surfactants and the co-solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.",2015,5897,FALSE
Could Glyphosate and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides Be Associated With Increased Thyroid Diseases Worldwide?,NO,95,Lisa,NO,"Romano, Renata Marino; de Oliveira, Jeane Maria; de Oliveira, Viviane Matoso; de Oliveira, Isabela Medeiros; Torres, Yohandra Reyes; Bargi-Souza, Paula; Martino Andrade, Anderson Joel; Romano, Marco Aurelio",FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY,"The increased incidence of thyroid diseases raises a series of questions about what the main predisposing factors are nowadays. If dietary restriction of iodine was once a major global health concern, today, the processes of industrialization of food and high exposure to a wide variety of environmental chemicals may be affecting, directly or indirectly, thyroid function. The homeostasis of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is finely regulated through the negative feedback mechanism exerted by thyroid hormones. Allostatic mechanisms are triggered to adjust the physiology of HPT axis in chronic conditions. Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides are pesticides with controversial endocrine disrupting activities and only few studies have approached their effects on HPT axis and thyroid function. However, glyphosate has an electrophilic and nucleophilic zwitterion chemical structure that may affect the mechanisms involved in iodide oxidation and organification, as well as the oxidative phosphorylation in the ATP synthesis. Thus, in this review, we aimed to: (1) discuss the critical points in the regulation of HPT axis and thyroid hormones levels balance, which may be susceptible to the toxic action of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, correlating the molecular mechanisms involved in glyphosate toxicity described in the literature that may, directly or indirectly, be associated to the higher incidence of thyroid diseases; and (2) present the literature regarding glyphosate toxicity in HPT axis.",2021,5990,TRUE
Glyphosate-based herbicide formulations and reproductive toxicity in animals,NO,96,Lisa,NO,"Jarrell, Zachery Ryan; Ahammad, Muslah Uddin; Benson, Andrew Parks",VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE,"The adoption of genetically engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has increased dramatically over the last few decades. Among the transgenic plants, those tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate are among the most common. Weed resistance to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) has been on the rise, leading to increased herbicide applications. This, in turn, has led to increased glyphosate residues in feed. Although glyphosate has been considered to be generally safe to animal health, recent studies have shown that GBHs have potential to cause adverse effects in animal reproduction, including disruption of key regulatory enzymes in androgen synthesis, alteration of serum levels of estrogen and testosterone, damage to reproductive tissues and impairment of gametogenesis. This review emphasizes known effects of GBHs on reproductive health as well as the potential risk GBH residues pose to animal agriculture.",2020,6001,TRUE
Impacts of sublethal insecticide exposure on insects - Facts and knowledge gaps,NO,97,Lisa,NO,"Mueller, Caroline",BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,"The biodiversity and biomass of insects is dramatically declining due to various anthropogenic factors. One of these factors is the use of insecticides to protect plants from pests. However, apart from the targeted pest insects, thousands of non-target organisms face traces of insecticides that are not lethal but can affect numerous traits of the individual, including development, physiology, behaviour and communication. In the present review, key facts on impacts of sublethal insecticide exposure on such traits are summarised. Attributable to various abiotic and biotic processes, insecticide concentrations may become sublethal in space and time. Nevertheless, these concentrations impede insect development, reducing growth and survival, but sometimes also enhance reproductive performance. The effects are species-specific, but sensitivity also differs within species depending on the developmental stage, sex and population. Furthermore, insecticide exposure influences several immunity pathways and causes changes in behaviour. Such changes are mostly studied on the level of behavioural traits. However, also effects on the consistency of overall individual behavioural phenotypes, i.e. personalities, should be investigated, which have consequences on individual fitness and on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents. Moreover, insecticides can act as info-disruptors, impeding signal production and perception during chemical communication at various levels. Finally, microbial symbionts may modify insect responses to insecticides, being of particular interest for biotechnological approaches. Here, methodological issues are discussed and knowledge gaps and potential future research directions are highlighted. Understanding the mechanisms of dose-dependent insecticide impacts on organisms and their cascading effects on higher levels of biological organisation and on subsequent generations are of utmost importance for proper insecticide use.

Toxicology and fate of Pestanal (R) and commercial propetamphos formulations in river and estuarine sediment,YES,98,Lisa,YES,"Garcia-Ortega, S; Holliman, PJ; Jones, DL",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"To quantify the impact of organophosphate pesticides on aquatic ecosystems requires a mechanistic understanding of their behaviour in a range of environmental matrices. The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption, biodegradation and toxic effects of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid, followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (K-d = 7-11) than for the Pestanal (R) grade (K-d = 4-10). The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t(1/2)=15 d) compared to anaerobic conditions (t(1/2) = 19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the Pestanal (R) grade of propetamphos based on EC50 (21 versus 236 mu g g(-1)) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 mu g g(-1)). In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of using commercial pesticide formulations when carrying out ecotoxicological testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2006,6168,TRUE
The percutaneous absorption and skin distribution of lindane in man. I. In vivo studies,NO,99,Lisa,NO,"Dick, IP; Blain, PG; Williams, FM",HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY,"1 The absorption and distribution of lindane through skin was examined using human volunteers. Two different preparations were employed, one with acetone as the vehicle and the other, a commercial product, consisting primarily of white spirit as the solvent base. 2 The mean peak plasma concentrations of lindane following exposure to the acetone and white-spirit based applications were 0.91 and 0.47 ng/ml, respectively. The similarity between these levels did not reflect the 40-fold higher dose of lindane in the acetone vehicle. White spirit enhanced the penetration of Lindane with respect to the acetone vehicle, highlighting the influence of vehicle upon percutaneous absorption. Low levels of trichlorophenol glucuronide metabolites, but no lindane, were detected in the urine. 3 The exposure site was washed at 6 h to mimic a decontamination procedure at the end of a working day. The proportion of the applied dose unabsorbed by 6 h was 80% and 10% for the acetone and the white spirit-based formulation, respectively. Small areas of the exposed site were tape stripped at 6 and 24 h to assess any lindane that may be associated with the stratum corneum. High levels were observed in the stratum corneum at 6 h exposure (up to 30% of the applied dose for the white spirit based formulation). However, this level had decreased by 24 h (by at least 90% of the amount found at 6 h). A gauze or gauze/shirt combination covering the application site between 6 and 24 h did account for some of this loss of lindane hem the stratum corneum attributed to friction and removal of exfoliated cells. The unaccounted proportion was presumed to have been absorbed through the skin into the systemic circulation. This demonstrates the absorption of chemicals can occur from a depot in the stratum corneum even following a wash procedure.",1997,6184,TRUE
"Residual effects of Spray Adjuvant, Scorch (R), on efficacy of Methoxyfenozide (SC 24%) and Spinosad (SC 24%) against the European Grapevine Moth, Lobesia botrana",NO,100,Lisa,NO,"Mosallanejad, Hadi; Broomand, Asghar",Pesticide Research Journal,"The results of field trials conducted to evaluate the influence of an adjuvant, Scorch (R), on the field efficacy of methoxyfenozide (SC24%) and spinosad (SC24%) against Lobesia botrana in Iran, are reported. Efficacy was evaluated 1 d after treatment (DAT) and then at 7d interval until 21 DAT. Scorch (R) was able to improve the efficacy of both the insecticides against L. botrana at all DAT intervals. The higher efficacy was supported by the lower values of the surface tension and the contact angle parameters of the spray solutions. By reducing the insecticides application rates by 20 per cent and adding adjuvant in the spraying liquid, the control efficiency was very similar to that of the treatment with the recommended rates. The results underscore the importance of adjuvants to improve the field efficacy of insecticides against L. botrana.",2021,6226,TRUE
