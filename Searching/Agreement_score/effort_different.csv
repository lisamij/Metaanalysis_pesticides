Ecological risk assessment of pollutant chemicals: Extinction risk based on population-level effects,NO,23,Lisa,YES,Tanaka Y.,Chemosphere,"The extinction probability is one of the most useful endpoints that are utilized in conservation biology. A parallel approach is advocated for the ecological risk assessment of chemical pollutants. The presented framework estimates extinction probability induced by pollutant chemicals in order to evaluate ecological hazards of pollution, and is applicable to any biological community (aquatic or terrestrial). The analytical framework, which is based on stochastic population dynamics theory, is briefly explained. The extinction risk estimation is feasible if ecotoxicological data concerning pollutant effects on population growth rate of organisms (the intrinsic rate of natural increase), and if environmental exposure concentration is provided. Tentative risk estimation was made for some agrochemicals and surfactants on zooplankton populations (Daphnia) as target organisms. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2003,988
Effects of 'inactive' ingredients on bees,NO,94,Lisa,YES,"Mullin, CA",CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE,"Honey bees are sensitive to widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals, and evaluation of the role of these 'inerts or inactives' in pollinator decline is only in its formative stages. Lack of disclosure of formulation ingredients in major products and lack of adequate methods for their analysis constrain the assessment of total chemical load and agrochemical exposures on bees. Most studies to document pesticide effects on honey bees are performed without the formulation or other relevant spray adjuvant components used to environmentally apply the toxicant. Formulations are generally more toxic than active ingredients, particularly fungicides, by up to 26,000-fold based on published literature. Some 'inactive' candidates for future risk assessment for pollinators include the organosilicone surfactants and the co-solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.",2015,5897
