Hentges C.R.; Schuck L.K.; De Abreu Caberlon C.; Tozetti A.M.; Oliveira G.T.,Impact of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate on Boana faber tadpoles exposed in the laboratory: Morphological and functional markers,2025,Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology,114,,,10.1016/j.etap.2025.104643,"This study evaluated the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the oxidative balance, energy metabolism, and body condition indices in tadpoles of Boana faber. Anuran spawns were collected, and after hatching and reaching Gosner stage 25, they were acclimated and exposed (168 hours) to concentrations of glyphosate (G1: 65, G2: 260, and G3: 520 µg/L). The body condition markers revealed a significant decrease in all these biomarkers in G2 and G3. Tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of glyphosate showed an increase in superoxide dismutase activity and the maintenance of lipoperoxidation levels. Carbonyl proteins of animals of G1 and G2 groups showed a reduction that coincides with increased catalase activity. Glycogen decreased in all exposed groups, indicating that this polysaccharide was used for energy production. The body condition markers established here are a non-invasive and promising way of assessing the health status of animals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V."
López-Valcárcel M.E.; del Arco A.; Araújo C.V.M.; Parra G.,Reduced avoidance behaviour in Daphnia magna due to agrochemical-induced vulnerability,2025,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,291,,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.117673,"The continuous discharge of agrochemicals used in intensive agriculture contaminates aquatic systems, harming aquatic biota and their processes. Although mobile organisms can avoid continuous exposure by moving to less-affected habitats, their capacity can be altered by pollutant exposure. Populations with a previous disturbance history, which show a lower ability to respond to subsequent stressors, are defined as vulnerable. Therefore, this study investigated the so far unknown escape capacity of a vulnerable zooplankton population previously exposed to a contaminated environment. To this end, agrochemically driven vulnerability was induced in populations of Daphnia magna by exposure to sublethal concentrations of glyphosate. Vulnerability was verified using a starvation test in which significant differences were observed between the control populations and populations with a disturbance history. Both the Control and Vulnerable populations were assessed for their avoidance capacity by exposing them to a glyphosate gradient using a Heterogeneous Multiple-Habitat Assay System (HeMHAS). The control populations showed a rapid reaction from the beginning of the assay, with avoidance rates increasing over 24 h, while vulnerable populations were unable to avoid contaminated habitats for up to 24 h. Therefore, we concluded that vulnerable populations have a lower capacity to avoid contaminated habitats. In heterogeneously contaminated habitats, a lower avoidance capacity is responsible for the differential spatial distribution of the affected species, which impacts the ecosystem structure. Additionally, agrochemically induced vulnerability and its effect on avoidance behaviour may affect ecosystem functioning through the altered spatial distribution of zooplankton populations. © 2025"

A highly superhydrophilic and stable graphite felt (GF)/polydopamine (PDA)/titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2-NT)/SnO2/Ru anode was fabricated and characterized for the degradation of glyphosate wastewater. Compared to control anodes, the GF/PDA/TiO2-NT/SnO2/Ru anode exhibited the highest removal efficiency (near to 100%) and a yield of phosphate ions of 76.51%, with the lowest energy consumption (0.088 Wh/L) for degrading 0.59 mM glyphosate (GH) at 7 mA/cm2 in 30 min. The exceptional activity of the anode may be attributed to the co-activation of lattice oxygen in TiO2-NT and SnO2 by coupled Ru, resulting in a significant amount of •O2− and oxygen vacancies as active sites for glyphosate degradation. After electrolysis, small molecular acids and inorganic ions were obtained, with hydroxylation and dephosphorization as the main degradation pathways. Eight cycles of experiments confirmed that Ru doping prominently enhanced the stability of the GF/PDA/TiO2-NT/SnO2/Ru anode due to its high oxygenophilicity and electron-rich ability, which promoted the generation and utilization efficiency of active free radicals and defects-associated oxygen. Therefore, this study introduces an effective strategy for efficiently co-activating lattice oxygen in SnO2 and TiO2-NT on graphite felt to eliminate persistent organophosphorus pesticides. © 2024 by the authors."
Yan B.; Luo L.; Zhang Y.; Men J.; Guo Y.; Wu S.; Han J.; Zhou B.,Detrimental effects of glyphosate on muscle metabolism in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus),2024,Aquatic Toxicology,276,,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.107122,"Glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, has been associated with environmental pollution and potential health risks to aquatic organisms. This study investigated the effects of glyphosate on the muscle metabolism of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) following exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations. Over a 14-day exposure period to varying glyphosate levels, significant disruptions were observed in antioxidant capacity and muscle health. These disruptions were evidenced by reductions in total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and decreases in activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, exposure to glyphosate resulted in a reduction of vitamin E content and an elevation of hormonal levels, suggesting the potential for endocrine disruption. Metabolomics analysis identified 605 distinct metabolites, with notable alterations in amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide metabolism pathways. Specifically, arginine and glutathione metabolisms were severely impacted, with decreases in key amino acids such as glycine and glutathione at higher glyphosate concentrations. Nucleotide metabolism, particularly purine synthesis, was also significantly affected, with reduced levels of deoxyguanosine and other purine-related compounds. The study further investigated the origins of these differential metabolites using the MetOrigin platform, suggesting a potential involvement of the intestinal microbiota in the metabolic response to glyphosate. These findings highlight the multifaceted adverse effects of glyphosate on fish muscle, including oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation, which may contribute to diminished muscle quality and health risks for aquatic organisms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
Fox A.; Leonard H.; Springer E.; Provoncha T.,Glyphosate Herbicide Impacts on the Seagrasses Halodule wrightii and Ruppia maritima from a Subtropical Florida Estuary,2024,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,12,,,10.3390/jmse12111941,"Seagrass meadows are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth, with losses attributed to increasing coastal populations, degraded water quality and climate change. As coastal communities work to improve water quality, there is increased concern regarding the use of herbicides within the watersheds of these sensitive ecosystems. Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide on Earth because it is non-selective and lethal to most plants. Also, the targeted amino acid synthesis pathway of glyphosate is not carried out by vertebrates, and it is generally considered one of the safer but effective herbicides on the market. At least partially due to its cost-effectiveness compared to other techniques, including mechanical harvesting, glyphosate use in the aquatic environment has increased in coastal areas to manage aquatic weeds, maintain navigable waterways and mitigate upland flooding. This has prompted concerns regarding potential ecosystem-level impacts. To test the acute toxicity of glyphosate to seagrasses, mesocosm experiments exposed Ruppia maritima and Halodule wrightii to 1 ppm, 100 ppm and 1000 ppm of glyphosate (as glyphosate acid). No significant decrease in leaf chlorophyll a (Chl a) was identified for either species at 1 ppm versus a control; however, significant decreases were observed at higher concentrations. In all except 1000 ppm mesocosms, water column Chl a increased, with a 7-fold increase at 100 ppm. These data demonstrate that at very high glyphosate concentrations, both acute toxicity and light limitation from enhanced algal biomass may have adverse impacts on seagrasses. Despite these observations, no significant adverse impacts attributed to acute toxicity were observed at 1 ppm, which is >1000 times higher than concentrations measured in the Indian River Lagoon system. Overall, herbicide use and associated decaying biomass contribute nutrients to these systems, in contrast to the removal of nutrients when mechanical harvesting is used. Based on our data and calculations, when used at recommended application rates, contributions to eutrophication, degraded water quality and harmful algal blooms were more likely to impact seagrasses than acute toxicity of glyphosate. © 2024 by the authors."

This study investigated whether pesticide active substances (AS) approved for conventional agriculture in Europe differ in their ecotoxicity from AS approved for organic agriculture. The evaluation was based on official ecotoxicological data for surrogate honeybee, bird, and earthworm species, which also serve as a reference for official environmental risk assessments in the pesticide authorization process. In October 2022, 268 chemical-synthetic AS approved for conventional and 179 nature-based AS approved for organic agriculture were listed in the EU Pesticide Database. Ecotoxicological data were only available for 254 AS approved for use in conventional agriculture and 110 AS approved for use in organic agriculture. The results showed a higher ecotoxicity of conventional AS: 79% (201 AS), 64% (163 AS) and 91% (230 AS) were moderately to acutely toxic to honeybees, birds, and earthworms, respectively, compared to 44% (48 AS), 14% (15 AS) and 36% (39 AS) of AS approved for organic agriculture. We have only considered the potential ecotoxicities of individual substances in this assessment; actual exposure in the field, where multiple AS formulations with other chemicals (including impurities) are applied, will be different. Nevertheless, these results emphasize that an increase in organic agriculture in Europe would reduce the ecotoxicological burden on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. © 2024 by the authors."
Morozov A.A.; Yurchenko V.V.,Effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid on biotransformation and stress response proteins in the liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio),2025,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology - Part D: Genomics and Proteomics,53,,,10.1016/j.cbd.2024.101366,"Herbicides pose a threat to various non-target organisms, including fish. A widely used herbicide, glyphosate, and its main breakdown product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), are quite ubiquitous in freshwater systems. The aim of this work was to analyze changes in the relative abundance of hepatic proteins participating in the biotransformation and response to chemical stress in adult zebrafish Danio rerio exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate (100 μg/L), AMPA (100 μg/L), and their mixture (50 μg/L + 50 μg/L) for two weeks. Proteomic analysis showed that the tested concentrations caused dysregulation of various biotransformation proteins, the most upregulated of which in all treatment groups was the Phase I enzyme cyp27a7. While glyphosate had a more pronounced impact on the biotransformation pathways, AMPA showed stronger interference with redox homeostasis. When acting together, the parent compound and its metabolite were more potent to disturb fish metabolic processes, including nucleotide metabolism and proteasome pathway, and to downregulate proteins known for their roles in protection from oxidative modifications of cellular constituents and disruption of redox signaling. © 2024"
Flach H.; Pfeffer S.; Dietmann P.; Kühl M.; Kühl S.J.,Glyphosate formulations cause mortality and diverse sublethal defects during embryonic development of the amphibian Xenopus laevis,2024,Chemosphere,367,,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143624,"The human impact on environmental landscapes, such as land use, climate change or pollution, is threatening global biodiversity and ecosystems maintenance. Pesticides like the herbicide glyphosate have garnered considerable attention due to their well-documented harmful effects on non-target species. During application, the active ingredient glyphosate is utilized in various formulations, each containing different additive adjuvants. However, the possible effects of these formulations on amphibians - the group with the highest decline rates among vertebrates - remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of four glyphosate formulations (Glyphosat TF, Durano TF, Helosate 450 TF, Kyleo) on the embryonic development of the model organism Xenopus laevis (South African clawed frog). Embryos at the 2-cell stage were exposed to various concentrations of glyphosate formulations (glyphosate: 0.01–100 mg/L), and mortality as well as sublethal effects on different organs and tissues were analyzed. The results indicated that the formulations had different effects, particularly on the mortality of Xenopus laevis embryos. At sublethal concentrations, the formulations altered the embryos' external appearance, leading to malformations such as reduced eye and head size. In addition, exposure to formulations impaired heart morphology and function, and the expression of heart-specific genes was altered at a molecular level. Our results confirmed that glyphosate formulations had a stronger effect on Xenopus laevis embryogenesis than pure glyphosate. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the active ingredient and the co-formulations independently, as well as the combined, commercially available products, during pesticide risk assessments and renewal procedures of agrochemicals. The severe global decline of amphibians, partly due to herbicide use, highlights the need for strict and efficient monitoring of environmental pesticide loads and application areas. © 2024 The Authors"

We investigated whether pesticide active ingredients (AIs) are still present in ornamentals at the time of purchase and assessed their potential ecotoxicity to non-target organisms. We purchased 1000 pot plants and 237 cut flowers of different species from garden centers in Austria and Germany between 2011 and 2021 and analyzed them for up to 646 AIs. Ecotoxicological risks of AIs were assessed by calculating toxic loads for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), birds (Passer domesticus), and mammals (Rattus norvegicus) based on the LD50 values of the detected AIs. Human health risks of AIs were assessed on the basis of the hazard statements of the Globally Harmonized System. Over the years, a total of 202 AIs were detected in pot plants and 128 AIs in cut flowers. Pesticide residues were found in 94% of pot plants and 97% of cut flowers, with cut flowers containing about twice as many AIs (11.0 ± 6.2 AIs) as pot plants (5.8 ± 4.0 AIs). Fungicides and insecticides were found most frequently. The ecotoxicity assessment showed that 47% of the AIs in pot plants and 63% of the AIs in cut flowers were moderately toxic to the considered non-target organisms. AIs found were mainly toxic to honeybees; their toxicity to earthworms, birds, and mammals was about 105 times lower. Remarkably, 39% of the plants labeled as “bee-friendly” contained AIs that were toxic to bees. More than 40% of pot plants and 72% of cut flowers contained AIs classified as harmful to human health. These results suggest that ornamental plants are vectors for potential pesticide exposure of consumers and non-target organisms in home gardens. © The Author(s) 2024."
Klátyik S.; Takács E.; Barócsi A.; Lenk S.; Kocsányi L.; Darvas B.; Székács A.,"Hormesis, the Individual and Combined Phytotoxicity of the Components of Glyphosate-Based Formulations on Algal Growth and Photosynthetic Activity",2024,Toxics,12,,,10.3390/toxics12040257,"The occurrence of the market-leading glyphosate active ingredient in surface waters is a globally observed phenomenon. Although co-formulants in pesticide formulations were considered inactive components from the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pesticide, several studies have proven the high individual toxicity of formulating agents, as well as the enhanced combined toxicity of the active ingredients and other components. Since the majority of active ingredients are present in the form of chemical mixtures in our environment, the possible combined toxicity between active ingredients and co-formulants is particularly important. To assess the individual and combined phytotoxicity of the components, glyphosate was tested in the form of pure active ingredient (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and herbicide formulations (Roundup Classic and Medallon Premium) formulated with a mixture of polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEA) or alkyl polyglucosides (APG), respectively. The order of acute toxicity was as follows for Roundup Classic: glyphosate < herbicide formulation < POEA. However, the following order was demonstrated for Medallon Premium: herbicide formulation < glyphosate < APG. Increased photosynthetic activity was detected after the exposure to the formulation (1.5–5.8 mg glyphosate/L and 0.5–2.2 mg POEA/L) and its components individually (glyphosate: 13–27.2 mg/L, POEA: 0.6–4.8 mg/L), which indicates hormetic effects. However, decreased photosynthetic activity was detected at higher concentrations of POEA (19.2 mg/L) and Roundup Classic (11.6–50.6 mg glyphosate/L). Differences were demonstrated in the sensitivity of the selected algae species and, in addition to the individual and combined toxicity of the components presented in the glyphosate-based herbicides. Both of the observed inhibitory and stimulating effects can adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems and water quality of surface waters. © 2024 by the authors."
Dauda S.; Uyovbisere E.E.; Lorenzi A.S.; Ibrahim Z.A.; Samuel S.A.; Gadzama I.M.K.; Chia M.A.,The impact of the herbicide paraquat on the interaction between a macrophyte (Lemna minor) and two species of cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Microcystis flos-aquae),2025,Aquatic Ecology,,,,10.1007/s10452-025-10188-9,"Macrophytes like Lemna minor and cyanobacteria species (for example, Microcystis aeruginosa and M. flos-aquae) co-exist naturally in water bodies, competing for nutrients, light and space, which influence their growth. The introduction of external factors such as herbicides into water bodies can influence the interaction between these aquatic organisms. This study examined the impact of paraquat, a widely used herbicide, on the interaction between L. minor and M. aeruginosa and M. flos-aquae. This was done by co-culturing L. minor (12 viable colonies) with M. aeruginosa and M. flos-aquae (both at 3.0 × 105 cells mL−1) separately, and with 10 µg L−1 of paraquat in BG-11 medium for 5 days. Monocultures of L. minor, M. aeruginosa, and M. flos-aquae were exposed to different concentrations of paraquat (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 50 µg L−1). An increase in paraquat concentration reduced the growth and biomass of L. minor, M. aeruginosa, and M. flos-aquae in single cultures, while decreasing total microcystin production in M. aeruginosa but increasing it in M. flos-aquae. When co-cultured with either M. aeruginosa or M. flos-aquae, the growth and biomass of L. minor decreased, and its POD activity increased. The presence of M. aeruginosa increased the MDA content and GST activity of L. minor, while the presence of M. flos-aque plus paraquat increased its proteins content and GST activity. On the other hand, the presence of L. minor plus paraquat decreased the growth and biomass of both cyanobacteria (M. aeruginosa and M. flos-aquae) and increased their microcystins production, H2O2 contents, POD and GST activities, and total proteins. These results demonstrate that the presence of paraquat amplifies the suppression of growth and increased stress of L. minor caused by both M. aeruginosa and M. flos-aquae, and vice-versa. This situation may exacerbate the competitive dynamics in aquatic environments by potentially altering community structures, a situation that could affect overall ecosystem health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025."
Maia M.E.; Martins R.X.; Carvalho M.; Félix L.M.; Marques-Santos L.F.; Farias D.,"Effects of atrazine, diuron and glyphosate mixtures on zebrafish embryos: acute toxicity and oxidative stress responses",2025,Ecotoxicology,34,304,316,10.1007/s10646-024-02839-8,"Synthetic pesticides are known for their toxic effects on non-target aquatic organisms. However, little is known about their effects when present in mixtures, which are closer to realistic exposure scenarios. Therefore, this study evaluates the toxicity of pesticides such as diuron, atrazine and glyphosate, individually and in combination, in zebrafish embryos, investigating their mechanisms of oxidative stress. The results revealed acute toxicity for diuron and atrazine, with LC50 values of 9.6 mg/L and 53.57 mg/L for 96-h-old zebrafish, respectively. On the other hand, no effect was observed for glyphosate alone at the maximum concentration tested (100 mg/L). The mixture of diuron and atrazine showed a synergistic effect, resulting in a decrease in the LC50 of each pesticide. Mixtures of diuron + glyphosate and atrazine + glyphosate were considered additive and antagonistic, respectively. All biomarkers analyzed (AChE, LDH, GST, CAT and GPx) showed significant changes. Furthermore, an increase in ROS production was observed in larvae exposed to individual and in the mixture composed of atrazine and diuron. These findings indicate that atrazine and diuron exhibit increased toxicity when combined, with their mechanisms of action—both in isolation and in mixtures—being at least partially linked to oxidative stress. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."
Morozov A.; Yurchenko V.,Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid impact on redox status and biotransformation in fish and the mitigating effects of diet supplementation,2024,Veterinary Research Communications,48,2901,2914,10.1007/s11259-024-10481-2,"Fish reared under seminatural conditions can be challenged by exposure to herbicides. Farming facilities relying on the surrounding area’s water quality can be affected by glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) contamination. This review summarizes findings on how glyphosate and AMPA in the amounts registered in surface waterbodies affect redox status and biotransformation in fish and covers the aspect of diet supplementation for oxidative stress relief. Environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA can alter the transcription and catalytic activities of antioxidant enzymes, decrease the content of reduced glutathione, and increase the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, all of which are signs of a redox imbalance. Glyphosate has been shown to affect complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and dysregulate iron transport-related genes, causing redox disturbance. Relatively high but environmentally realistic glyphosate concentrations can initiate the induction of cytochrome P450 biotransformation enzymes, alter the regulation of ABC exporters, and cause the inhibition of the redox-sensitive Nrf2 signaling pathway. Studies on reducing herbicide toxicity through dietary supplementation are a promising area of research. Natural functional supplements have been proven to have great potential for mitigating glyphosate-induced oxidative stress and thereby improving fish health, which in turn means maintaining productivity in fish farms that use natural water. However, data on the effects of AMPA on fish are scarce, and studies on the alleviation of its toxicity in fish are lacking. Considering the variety of AMPA contamination routes, one cannot underestimate the need for further research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

We aimed to study changes in the liver proteome of a model cyprinid fish species, zebrafish Danio rerio, to provide a molecular basis for the adverse effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate (100 μg/L), its breakdown product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; 100 μg/L), and a mixture of both (50 + 50 μg/L) in the presence of humic acid (20 mg/L), which simulated a component of natural organic matter in the aquatic environment. Proteomic analysis was performed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry employing a label-free quantification approach. The results present molecular evidence of the stress responses and disturbance of primary metabolic processes such as immune response, dysregulation in DNA repair, necroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, cholesterol, lipoprotein, and carbohydrate metabolism. We registered the synergistic effect of the glyphosate and AMPA co-exposure, which was expressed in a substantial increase in the number of dysregulated proteins compared to the solo treatments. Humic acid alleviated the effects of glyphosate and its mixture with AMPA and aggravated the impact of AMPA exposure. RuvB-like 2, a protein taking part in DNA repair, and EIF2S1, involved in the regulation of stress-induced gene expression, were downregulated in the liver of zebrafish from all treatments. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

An overview is provided on the water protection linked to freshwater stressors: solar ultraviolet radiation, thermal pollution, nanoparticles, radioactive pollution, salinization, nutrients, sedimentation, drought, extreme floods, fragmentation, pesticides, war and terrorism, algal blooms, invasive aquatic plants, riparian vegetation, and invasive aquatic fish. Altogether, these stressors build an exceptionally composite background of stressors that are continuously changing freshwater ecosystems and diminishing or even destroying their capability to create and maintain ongoing natural healthy products and essential services to humans. Environmental and human civilization sustainability cannot exist without the proper management of freshwater ecosystems all over the planet; this specific management is impossible if the widespread studied stressors are not deeply understood structurally and functionally. Without considering each of these stressors and their synergisms, the Earth’s freshwater is doomed in terms of both quantitative and qualitative aspects. © 2024 by the authors."
Morales-Olivares M.I.; Castrejón-Godínez M.L.; Mussali-Galante P.; Tovar-Sánchez E.; Saldarriaga-Noreña H.A.; Rodríguez A.,Characterization of Glyphosate Resistance and Degradation Profile of Caballeronia zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 and Genes Involved in Its Degradation,2025,Microorganisms,13,,,10.3390/microorganisms13030651,"Herbicides are the most employed pesticides in agriculture worldwide; among them, glyphosate is the most successful herbicide molecule in history. The extensive use of glyphosate has been related to environmental pollution and toxic effects on non-target organisms. Effective remediation and treatment alternatives must be developed to reduce the environmental presence of glyphosate and its adverse effects. Bioremediation using microorganisms has been proposed as a feasible alternative for treating glyphosate pollution; due to this, identifying and characterizing microorganisms capable of biodegrading glyphosate is a key environmental task for the bioremediation of polluted sites by this herbicide. This study characterized the glyphosate resistance profile and degradation capacity of the bacterial strain Caballeronia zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3. According to the results of the bacterial growth inhibition assays on agar plates, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 can resist exposure to high concentrations of glyphosate, up to 1600 mg/L in glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) formulation, and 12,000 mg/L of the analytical-grade molecule. In the inhibition assay in liquid media, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 resisted glyphosate exposure to all concentrations evaluated (25–400 mg/L). After 48 h exposure, GBH caused important bacterial growth inhibition (>80%) at concentrations between 100 and 400 mg/L, while exposure to analytical-grade glyphosate caused bacterial growth inhibitions below 15% in all tested concentrations. Finally, this bacterial strain was capable of degrading 60% of the glyphosate supplemented to culture media (50 mg/L), when used as the sole carbon source, in twelve hours; moreover, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 can also degrade the primary glyphosate degradation metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). Genomic analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with the two reported metabolic pathways for glyphosate degradation, the sarcosine and AMPA pathways. This is the first report on the glyphosate degradation capacity and the genes related to its metabolism in a Caballeronia genus strain. The results from this investigation demonstrate that C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 exhibits significant potential for glyphosate biodegradation, suggesting its applicability in bioremediation strategies targeting this contaminant. © 2025 by the authors."

Thus, the fish were exposed to three RWG concentrations plus one negative control, which represents the concentration allowed for inland Brazilian waters and concentrations found in surface water worldwide (0.0, 0.065, 0.65, and 6.5 mg a.i./L) for 7 and 15 days. Morphological analysis revealed significant alterations in the testicular structure, particularly in Sertoli cell extensions and cytoplasmic bridges between germ cells. Subcellular compartments also displayed alterations, including dilated mitochondria and the loss of electron density and autophagic vesicles. Gene transcript levels related to autophagy and steroidogenic regulation were upregulated in exposed fish. Germ cell quality was also affected, increasing ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and DNA fragmentation. The study highlighted the RWG reproductive toxicity, providing valuable insights into understanding the morphofunctional alterations in somatic and germ cells of Danio rerio. In conclusion, the environmental relevant concentrations used in this study were toxic to male somatic and germ cells, which raises a concern about the concentrations considered safe for human and animal use.

Lozano V.L.; Pizarro H.N.,Glyphosate lessons: is biodegradation of pesticides a harmless process for biodiversity?,2024,Environmental Sciences Europe,36,,,10.1186/s12302-024-00884-y,"The historical perspective on the rapid biodegradation of pesticides as a mitigating factor in environmental risk assessment is reexamined through the example of glyphosate and its implications for freshwater biodiversity. Commonly employed standardized methods by national agencies for assessing the environmental risk of pesticides predominantly rely on single-species tests, overlooking the intricate nature of ecosystems. Glyphosate, one of the most widely used pesticides marketed for its purported rapid biodegradability, is often perceived as relatively innocuous. However, its degradation releases phosphorus into the environment, inducing a trophic state shift in water systems towards more eutrophic conditions, consequently affecting water quality. These findings highlight the cascading ecological repercussions of glyphosate biodegradation, driving the proliferation of specific aquatic organisms, such as picocyanobacteria and metaphyton, resulting in the alteration of ecosystem structure and dynamics. The study explores challenges posed by commercial pesticide formulations and investigates the consequences of pesticide interactions with specific anthropogenic factors. A case in point is the interaction of glyphosate with the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei, exacerbating the overall scenario. The ecological framework analyzed challenges the conventional notion that pesticide biodegradation is inherently a neutral or positive event. The results underscore the necessity of reassessing the role of biodegradation itself in environmental impact assessments for pesticides. © The Author(s) 2024."
