This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.

Dietary medicinal herbs present a practical solution to relieve the impacts of herbicides toxicity on the performances of aquatic animals. Herein, we investigated the toxicity of commercial glyphosate-induced oxidative stress, immunosuppression, liver and kidney dysfunction, and the protective role of ginger or ginger nanoparticles in Nile tilapia. Fish were allocated into four groups: the first group presented the control without glyphosate toxicity and ginger feeding, the second group intoxicated with glyphosate at 0.6 mg/L and fed ginger free diet, the third group intoxicated with glyphosate and fed ginger at 2.5 g/kg, and the fourth group intoxicated with glyphosate and fed ginger nanoparticles at 2.5 g/kg. Fish were kept under the experimental conditions for four weeks, and the samples of blood and tissues were collected after 2 and 4 weeks. Markedly, fish exposed to glyphosate showed the highest ALT and AST activities, glucose and cortisol levels, and malondialdehyde levels (MDA) in gills and tissues. While fish in the control and fish intoxicated with glyphosate and fed ginger nanoparticles had the lowest ALT and AST activities, glucose and cortisol levels, and MDA levels after 2 and 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Fish fed dietary ginger had lower ALT and AST activities, glucose and cortisol levels, and MDA levels than the glyphosate intoxicated group after 2 and 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Interestingly, fish-fed ginger nanoparticles showed lower urea and creatinine levels and higher total protein, albumin, and globulin than the glyphosate intoxicated group (P < 0.05) and similar to the control (P > 0.05). Further, fish intoxicated with glyphosate and fed ginger nanoparticles had the highest GSH, lysozyme activity, and immunoglobulin levels after 2 and 4 weeks (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ginger nanoparticles are superior to the standard ginger form in enhancing the antioxidative and immune responses of Nile tilapia exposed to glyphosate.",2023,47,445,455,10.1007/s11259-022-09961-0
"Abdelmagid, AD; Said, AM; Gawad, EAA; Shalaby, SA; Dawood, MAO",Propolis nanoparticles relieved the impacts of glyphosate-induced oxidative stress and immunosuppression in Nile tilapia,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The risk of the waterborne toxicity caused by herbicides threatens the aquatic environment. In this study, propolis nanoparticles were shown to relieve the impacts of glyphosate-induced oxidative stress and immunosuppression in Nile tilapia. The control group was fed a basal diet and maintained in a glyphosate-free water (control). Simultaneously, the other three groups were exposed to sublethal concentrations of glyphosate (0.6 mg/L) and fed diets containing 0 and 10 g propolis and 10 g propolis nanoparticles for 4 weeks. Nile tilapia exposed to glyphosate for 2 and 4 weeks exhibited a significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, and creatinine values compared to the control. After 2 and 4 weeks, fish exposed to glyphosate who were not fed propolis and propolis nanoparticles showed a significant reduction in total protein, albumin, and globulin levels, lysozyme activity, and total immunoglobulin levels. Nile tilapia exposed to glyphosate displayed a significant increase in blood glucose and cortisol concentrations after 2 and 4 weeks. Furthermore, liver and gill tissues from fish exposed to glyphosate exhibited a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. Conversely, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the liver and gill MDA levels and AChE activity of the groups treated with propolis and propolis nanoparticles compared to the groups exposed to glyphosate and fed the basal diet. Fish exposed to glyphosate for 2 and 4 weeks showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in hepatic and gill glutathione (GSH) concentration and white blood cell and red blood cell counts compared to the control group. Meanwhile, these parameters in groups fed propolis and propolis nanoparticles were markedly ameliorated compared to exposed fish fed the basal diet. Dietary supplementation of propolis nanoparticles is superior to supplementation of propolis in the normal form for protecting Nile tilapia from glyphosate toxicity.",2022,29,19778,19789,10.1007/s11356-021-17201-2
"Latorre, MA; González, ECL; Larriera, A; Poletta, GL; Siroski, PA",Effects of in vivo exposure to Roundup® on immune system of Caiman latirostris,JOURNAL OF IMMUNOTOXICOLOGY,"The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of Roundup (R) (RU, glyphosate-based formulation) on some parameters of the immune system and growth of Caiman latirostris. Seventy-two caimans (20-day-old) from Proyecto Yacare' (Gob. Santa Fe/MUPCN) were used. Two groups were exposed for 2 months to different concentrations of RU (11 or 21 mg/L; taking into account the concentration recommended for its application in the field), while one group was maintained as control. The RU concentration was progressively decreased through the exposure period to simulate glyphosate degradation in water. Animals were measured and weighed at the beginning and end of the experiment, and blood samples taken after exposure to determine total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts as well as total protein concentration (TPC), and for performing protein electrophoresis. The results showed that, compared against control hosts, there was a decrease in WBC counts, a higher percentage of heterophils, a higher TPC (with a low percentage of F2 protein fraction), and a negative effect on growth in the young caimans exposed to RU. These results demonstrate that in vivo exposure to RU induced alterations in the selected immune parameters, plasma proteins, and growth of caimans, thereby providing relevant information about the effects of this type of pesticide in this important species in the Argentinian wetlands.",2013,10,349,354,10.3109/1547691X.2012.747233

"García, CASY; Schiaffino, MR; Lozano, VL; Vera, MS; Ferraro, M; Izaguirre, I; Pizarro, H",New findings on the effect of glyphosate on autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton structure: A microcosm approach,AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY,"Massive use of glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural activities has led to the appearance of this herbicide in freshwater systems, which represents a potential threat to these systems and their communities. These herbicides can affect autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton abundance. However, little is known about glyphosate impact on the whole structure of these assemblages. Herein, we used an 8-day long microcosm approach under indoor controlled conditions to analyze changes in the structure of picoplankton exposed to a single pulse of glyphosate. The analyzed picoplankton correspond to two outdoor ponds with contrasting states: clear (chlorophyll-a = 3.48 mu g L-1 +/- 1.15; nephelometric turbidity, NTU = 1) and turbid (chlorophyll-a = 105.96 L-1 +/- 15.3; NTU = 48). We evaluated herbicide impact on different picoplankton cytometric populations and further explored changes in bacterial dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) fingerprinting. We observed that glyphosate induced a drastic decrease in the abundance of phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria. Particularly, in the turbid system this effect resulted in an 85 % decrease in the abundance of the whole autotrophic picoplankton. Glyphosate also changed the structure of the heterotrophic fraction by means of changing bacterial dominant OTUs fingerprinting patterns in both systems and by shifting the relative abundances of cytometric groups in the clear scenario. These results demonstrate that upon glyphosate exposure picoplanktonic fractions face not only the already reported changes in abundance, but also alterations in the composition of cytometric groups and of bacterial dominant operational taxonomic units. This research provides suitable and still little explored tools to analyze agrochemical effects on picoplanktonic communities.",2020,222,,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105463

The present work aimed to evaluate the effects of GBH and Pure Glyphosate (PG) exposure on Danio rerio embryos at drinking water concentrations. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 250, 500, and 1000 mu g L-1 of Roundup Original DI (R) and pure glyphosate for 96 h. Glyphosate concentration in water, parameters physicochemical water, survival, hatching rate, heart rate, malformations, behavior, and biomarkers were evaluated. We verified that at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf), animals exposed to GBH 500 showed decreased survival as compared to the control. The hatching rate increased in all groups exposed to GBH at 48 hpf as compared to the control group. The embryos exposed did not present changes in the spontaneous movement and touch response. Exposed groups to GBH demonstrated a higher number of malformations in fish embryos as compared to the control. Most malformations were: pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, body malformations, and curvature of the spine. In heart rate, bradycardia occurred in groups exposed, as predicted due to cardiac abnormalities. As biochemical endpoints, we observed a decrease in Glutathione S-transferase (GBH 250, GBH 500 and PG 250) and Acetylcholinesterase (GBH 250 and PG 250) activity. No differences were found between the groups in the concentration of protein, Total Antioxidant Capacity Against Peroxyl Radicals, Lipid peroxidation, Reactive Oxygen Species, Non-protein thiols, and Catalase. In conclusion, the damage in all evaluated stages of development was aggravated by survival and malformations. Therefore, the large-scale use of GBHs, coupled with the permissiveness of its presence could be the cause damage to the aquatic environment affecting the embryonic development of non-target organisms.",2023,95,,,10.1016/j.ntt.2022.107147
"Annett, R; Habibi, HR; Hontela, A",Impact of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides on the freshwater environment,JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is a broad spectrum, post emergent herbicide and is among the most widely used agricultural chemicals globally. Initially developed to control the growth of weed species in agriculture, this herbicide also plays an important role in both modern silviculture and domestic weed control. The creation of glyphosate tolerant crop species has significantly increased the demand and use of this herbicide and has also increased the risk of exposure to non-target species. Commercially available glyphosate-based herbicides are comprised of multiple, often proprietary, constituents, each with a unique level of toxicity. Surfactants used to increase herbicide efficacy have been identified in some studies as the chemicals responsible for toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides to non-target species, yet they are often difficult to chemically identify. Most glyphosate-based herbicides are not approved for use in the aquatic environment; however, measurable quantities of the active ingredient and surfactants are detected in surface waters, giving them the potential to alter the physiology of aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity is highly species dependant across all taxa, with toxicity depending on the timing, magnitude, and route of exposure. The toxicity of glyphosate to amphibians has been a major focus of recent research, which has suggested increased sensitivity compared with other vertebrates due to their life history traits and reliance on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. This review is designed to update previous reviews of glyphosate-based herbicide toxicity, with a focus on recent studies of the aquatic toxicity of this class of chemicals.

"Antier, C; Kudsk, P; Reboud, X; Ulber, L; Baret, PV; Messéan, A",Glyphosate Use in the European Agricultural Sector and a Framework for Its Further Monitoring,SUSTAINABILITY,"Monitoring pesticide use is essential for assessing farming practices and the risks associated with the use of pesticides. Currently, there are neither consolidated, public data available on glyphosate use in Europe, nor a standardized categorization of its major uses. In this study, data on glyphosate sales and use in Europe were collected from multiple sources and compiled into a dataset of the agricultural use of glyphosate from 2013 to 2017. The survey shows that glyphosate represented 33% of the herbicide volume sold in Europe in 2017. One third of the acreage of annual cropping systems and half of the acreage of perennial tree crops received glyphosate annually. Glyphosate is widely used for at least eight agronomic purposes, including weed control, crop desiccation, terminating cover crops, terminating temporary grassland and renewing permanent grassland. Glyphosate use can be classified into occasional uses-i.e., exceptional applications, triggered by meteorological conditions or specific farm constraints-and recurrent uses, which are widespread practices that are embedded in farming systems and for which other agronomic solutions may exist but are not frequently used. This article proposes a framework for the precise monitoring of glyphosate use, based on the identification of the cropping systems in which glyphosate is used, the agronomic purposes for which it is employed, the dose used and the rationale behind the different uses.",2020,12,,,10.3390/su12145682
"Antunes, AM; Rocha, TL; Pires, FS; de Freitas, MA; Leite, VRMC; Arana, S; Moreira, PC; Sabóia-Morais, SMT",Gender-specific histopathological response in guppies Poecilia reticulata exposed to glyphosate or its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid,JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY,"Ecotoxicity of glyphosate (GLY) and itsmetabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) was investigated in guppies, Poecilia reticulata. We tested the effects of these chemicals on the gills and liver of bothmale and female guppies using qualitative and quantitative histopathological analyses associated with histopathological condition indexes. Both genders showed similar median lethal concentration (LC50) at 96 h for GLY (68.78 and 70.87mg l(-1)) and AMPA (180 and 164.32mg l(-1)). However, the histopathological assessment of both fish organs exposed to sublethal concentrations of GLY (35mg l(-1)) and AMPA ( 82mg l(-1)) for 96h showed a tissue-and gender-specific histopathological response. In both exposure assays, fish presented mainly progressive changes, such as proliferation of the interlamellar epithelium, partial and total fusion of secondary lamellae. The liver showed mainly regressive changes, such as steatosis, pyknotic nuclei and high distribution of collagen fibers. Unusually large hepatocytes as degenerated cells were also detected. Histopathological changes in gills were similar for the males and females, but the liver response was different between the genders. The hepatic inflammatory changes were more common in males. The increase in the area of hepatocyte vacuoles is gender dependent with higher values in the male compared to the female guppies exposed to GLY and AMPA. Multiparametric analysis indicated that the male guppies are-more sensitive than females, particularly in the presence of AMPA. Our study shows that the histopathological assessment associated with gender-specific response can be successfully used in ecotoxicological assessment of GLY and the metabolite AMPA.

"Aparicio, VC; De Gerónimo, E; Marino, D; Primost, J; Carriquiriborde, P; Costa, JL",Environmental fate of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid in surface waters and soil of agricultural basins,CHEMOSPHERE,"Argentinian agricultural production is fundamentally based on a technological package that combines no-till and glyphosate in the cultivation of transgenic crops. Transgenic crops (soybean, maize and cotton) occupy 23 million hectares. This means that glyphosate is the most employed herbicide in the country, where 180-200 million liters are applied every year. The aim of this work is to study the environmental fate of glyphosate and its major degradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), in surface water and soil of agricultural basins. Sixteen agricultural sites and forty-four streams in the agricultural basins were sampled three times during 2012. The samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS ESI(+/-). In cultivated soils, glyphosate was detected in concentrations between 35 and 1502 mu g kg(-1), while AMPA concentration ranged from 299 to 2256 mu g kg(-1). In the surface water studied, the presence of glyphosate and AMPA was detected in about 15% and 12% of the samples analyzed, respectively. In suspended particulate matter, glyphosate was found in 67% while AMPA was present in 20% of the samples. In streams sediment glyphosate and AMPA were also detected in 66% and 88.5% of the samples respectively. This study is, to our knowledge, the first dealing with glyphosate fate in agricultural soils in Argentina. In the present study, it was demonstrated that glyphosate and AMPA are present in soils under agricultural activity. It was also found that in stream samples the presence of glyphosate and AMPA is relatively more frequent in suspended particulate matter and sediment than in water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of glyphosate on ovaries of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were exposed to 65 mu g/L of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] for 15 d. This concentration was determined according to Resolution 357/2005/CONAMA/Brazil, which establishes the permissible concentration of glyphosate in Brazilian inland waters. Nonexposed ovaries (n = 18 per triplicate) were used as control. Subsequently, morphology and expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) of exposed and nonexposed ovaries was determined. No apparent changes were noted in general morphology of exposed and nonexposed ovaries. However, a significant increase in diameter of oocytes was observed after exposure to glyphosate. When ovarian ultrastructure was examined the presence of concentric membranes, appearing as myelin-like structures, associated with the external membranes of mitochondria and with yolk granules was found. After glyphosate exposure, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting revealed greater expression of SF-1 in the oocytes, which suggests a relationship between oocyte growth and SF-1 expression. These subtle adverse effects of glyphosate on oocytes raised a potential concern for fish reproduction. These results contribute to understanding glyphosate-induced toxicity to nontarget organisms, showing subcellular and molecular impairments that may affect reproduction in +female fish.",2014,77,405,414,10.1080/15287394.2014.880393

The acute and chronic toxicities of GLY and CPF were determined as individual compounds and as a mixture. Rotifers were exposed to environmental concentrations of GLY (1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L) and CPF (0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mu g/L). The main findings were as follows: (i) the LC50 values were 33.91 mg/L (GLY) and 280 mu g/L (CPF); (ii) the toxic unit (TU50) of the mixture was 0.30, corresponding to 10.17 mg/L GLY and 83 mu g/L CPF; (iii) the multigenerational study indicated that the tested concentrations of GLY and CPF, both single and combined, significantly and consistently decreased the growth rates of P. similis from the F0 to F6 generations; (iv) in most cases, GLY and CPF mixtures induced a strong synergistic effect; and (v) transgenerational effects were detected in the F4 generation, especially GLY and CPF in higher equitoxic proportions. These effects seem to dissipate in F5. Across multigeneration, a slight recovery could indicate population resilience to pollution. Our findings suggest that a mixture of GLY and CPF at environmental concentrations is likely to occur under real field conditions, increasing the risk to marine and estuarine invertebrates such as rotifers.",2023,318,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120708

This study was conducted with the aim of providing a comparative evaluation of the effects of glyphosate-based and its derived chemicals on the larval development of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, thus providing new data to describe the potential ecotoxicity of these contaminants. In particular, the effects on larval development, growth and metabolism were assessed during 48 h of exposure from the time of egg fertilization. The results confirm that AMPA and its parent compound, glyphosate have similar toxicity, as observed in other marine invertebrates.

At the end of the in vivo assay, the body weight gain and the ovarian growth were estimated, the last one in terms of the gonadosomatic index (GSI), the relative proportion of the different kind of oocytes, and their relative size. A decrease in the body weight gain was observed by effect of pure glyphosate, at all concentrations assayed. Although no differences in either the GSI or vitellogenic protein content of the ovary were noted between any glyphosate concentration and control, a higher proportion of reabsorbed vitellogenic oocytes was observed in the ovaries of crabs exposed to glyphosate at 1 mg/L, together with an increased area of previtellogenic oocytes. These effects were confirmed in vitro, at a glyphosate concentration of 0.2 mg/L. In fact, a higher area of previtellogenic oocytes was seen when glyphosate was added to the culture medium containing ovarian tissue, but a significant higher incidence of reabsorbed vitellogenic oocytes was seen only when eyestalk tissue was also added to the vials, suggesting that the secretion of some neurohormone involved in reabsorption is enhanced. The obtained results indicate that glyphosate is able to harm, in the studied species, both somatic and the ovarian growth.",2018,229,,,10.1007/s11270-018-3698-0

The global amphibian declines, for example, have been positively correlated with pesticides use. The differential susceptibility in the developmental stages of amphibians to chemical substances are still largely unknown. We examined the 96-h differential toxicity responses of embryos, premetamorphic and transitional larval stage of Xenopus laevis, to six formulated aquatic herbicide products containing the active ingredients of diquat dibromide (Midstream), glufosinate ammonium (Basta), imazapyr (Arsenal), and three glyphosate formulations (Roundup, Kilo Max, and Environ Glyphosate). The results showed the premetamorphic stage as the most sensitive to the herbicides toxicity. This study confirmed that the developmental stage at which amphibian are exposed to contaminants is critical to their survival and that the chemical contamination hypothesis of the global decline of amphibians should continue to be considered. This establishment of the premetamorphic larval as sensitive toxicity representative for all developmental stages of X. laevis means that this stage could be used more extensively in pesticides toxicity assessments.",2018,75,8,16,10.1007/s00244-017-0463-0
"Bach, NC; Marino, DJG; Natale, GS; Somoza, GM","Effects of glyphosate and its commercial formulation, Roundup® Ultramax, on liver histology of tadpoles of the neotropical frog, Leptodactylus latrans (amphibia: Anura)",CHEMOSPHERE,"In the last years, the agricultural expansion has led to an increased use of pesticides, with glyphosate as the most widely used worldwide. This is also the situation in Argentina, where glyphosate formulations are the most commercialized herbicides. It is known that glyphosate formulations are much more toxic than the active ingredient, and this difference in toxicity can be attributed to the adjuvants present in the formula. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare sub-lethal histological effects of the glyphosate formulation Roundup Ultramax and glyphosate active ingredient on Leptodactylus latrans tadpoles at Gosner-stage 36. Semi-static bioassays were performed using 96 h of exposure with Roundup Ultramax formulation (RU; 0.37-5.25 mg a.e./L.), glyphosate (GLY; 3-300 mg/L), and a control group. RU exposure showed an increment in the melanomacrophagic cells (MMc) and melanomacrophagic centers (MMCs) from 0.37 mg a.e./L. GLY exposure showed a significant increment in the number of MMc from 15 mg/L, and of MMCs from 3 mg/L. Also, histopathological lesions were observed in the liver of tadpoles exposed to both, GLY and RU. These lesions included: lipidosis and hepatic congestion, but only RU showed significant differences respect to control, with a LOEC value of 2.22 mg a.e./L for both effects. In sum, this study represents the first evidence of adverse effects of glyphosate and RU formulation on the liver of anuran larvae at concentrations frequently found in the environment.

Over the past few years, the number of studies revealing deleterious effects of glyphosate on non-target species has been increasing. Here, we studied the impact of glyphosate at field-realistic doses on learning in mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti). Larvae of A. aegypti live in small bodies of water and perform a stereotyped escape response when a moving object projects its shadow on the water surface. Repeated presentations of an innocuous visual stimulus induce a decrease in response due to habituation, a non-associative form of leaming. In this study, different groups of larvae were reared in water containing different concentrations of glyphosate that are commonly found in the field (50 mu g l(-1),100 mu g l(-1), 210 mu g l(-1) and 2 mu g l(-1)). Larvae reared in a glyphosate solution of 2 mg l(-1) (application dose) could complete their development. However, glyphosate at a concentration of 100 mu g l(-1) impaired habituation. A dose-dependent deleterious effect on leaming ability was observed. This protocol opens new avenues to further studies aimed at understanding how glyphosate affects non-target organisms, such as insects. Habituation in mosquito larvae could serve as a parameter for testing the impact of pollutants in the water.",2018,221,,,10.1242/jeb.187518

Moreover, the development and diversity of these aquatic organisms could also be affected by human-induced climate change that might lead to more periods with extreme temperatures. However, to what extent non-target effects of these herbicides on amphibians or algae are altered by varying temperature is not well known. Methods: We studied effects of five concentrations of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup PowerFlex (0, 1.5, 3, 4 mg acid equivalent glyphosate L-1 as a one time addition and a pulse treatment of totally 4 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1) on larval development of Common toads (Bufo bufo, L.; Amphibia: Anura) and associated algae communities under two temperature regimes (15 vs. 20 degrees C). Results: Herbicide contamination reduced tail growth (-8%), induced the occurrence of tail deformations (i.e. lacerated or crooked tails) and reduced algae diversity (-6%). Higher water temperature increased tadpole growth (tail and body length (tl/bl) +66%, length-to-width ratio +4%) and decreased algae diversity (-21%). No clear relation between herbicide concentrations and tadpole growth or algae density or diversity was observed. Interactive effects of herbicides and temperature affected growth parameters, tail deformation and tadpole mortality indicating that the herbicide effects are temperature-dependent. Remarkably, herbicide-temperature interactions resulted in deformed tails in 34% of all herbicide treated tadpoles at 15 degrees C whereas no tail deformations were observed for the herbicide-free control at 15 degrees C or any tadpole at 20 degrees C; herbicide-induced mortality was higher at 15 degrees C but lower at 20 degrees C. Discussion: These herbicide-and temperature-induced changes may have decided effects on ecological interactions in freshwater ecosystems. Although no clear dose-response effect was seen, the presence of glyphosate was decisive for an effect, suggesting that the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) in our study was 1.5 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1 water. Overall, our findings also question the relevance of pesticide risk assessments conducted at standard temperatures.",2016,4,,,10.7717/peerj.2641

This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of chlorpyrifos and glyphosate on biochemical, immunological parameters, and oxidative stress biomarkers in freshwater crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus for 21 days. The experimental design of this study was factorial (3 x 3), including 0.0, 0.4, and 0.8 mg L-1 glyphosate and 0.0, 2.5, and 5 mu g L-1 chlorpyrifos. The exposure to chlorpyrifos, glyphosate alone and a mixture of them significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, phenoloxidase activities, and total protein levels. The lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic-pyruvic-transaminase, and catalase activities, the contents of glucose, and malondialdehyde levels were increased in the crayfish. No significant changes were detected in glutamic-oxaloacetic-transaminase (SGOT) activity, triglyceride, and total antioxidant (TAO) levels in the crayfish treated with 0.4 mg L-1 glyphosate and the control group. Co-exposure of crayfish to chlorpyrifos and glyphosate increased SGOT activity and TAO levels. Although chlorpyrifos combined with glyphosate decreased the gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, the GGT activity was significantly increased in the P. leptodactylus exposed during 21 days to 5 mu g L-1 chlorpyrifos alone and 0.8 mg L-1 glyphosate alone. In comparison with the reference group, no significant changes were evidenced in the cholesterol levels in the P. leptodactylus treated with 2.5 mu g L-1 chlorpyrifos, but its levels were significantly increased in the other treatment groups. In conclusion, the mix of glyphosate and chlorpyrifos exhibited synergic effects on the different toxicological biomarkers in the narrow-clawed crayfish. Co-exposure to pesticides may result in disruption of homeostasis in the crayfish by altering the biochemical and immunological parameters.",2020,29,1500,1515,10.1007/s10646-020-02233-0

The food preferences of zebrafish during the first-feeding stage (which is critical for the survival of organisms), were analyzed because of the requirement for live food. Larval survival begins to be affected when glyphosate intake exceeds 0.3666 mu g/larvae/day, in the case that only the food is contaminated; if the medium is also contaminated, the effects on survival start from 0.2456 mu g/larvae/day. It was shown that glyphosate was more likely to be incorporated through the medium than through the food (zooplankton), which supports the results of previous studies that have ruled out the potential for biomagnification. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of glyphosate was determined using an ELISA tests specific to measure glyphosate in the fish D. rerio, the rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and Lecane papuana, and the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia. The experimental design consisted in exposing seven zebrafish adults per replica (four replicates) in three treatments 1, 5, and 10 mg/L of glyphosate for 96 h to obtain bioconcentration factors in the gills, liver, and muscle. These concentrations were selected as potential glyphosate concentrations right after application as double highest reported concentration. Glyphosate levels in zooplankton can represent up to 6.26% of the total weight of rotifers (BFC = 60.35) and in zebrafish adult organs were less than 8 mu g/mg of tissue (BCF values < 6). Although glyphosate does not biomagnify, our results suggest that glyphosate affected the dynamics between zooplankton and zebrafish larvae, diminishing survival and feeding rates, given that zooplankton species bioconcentrate glyphosate in large quantities. The BCF values found in this contribution are higher than expected. Glyphosate exposure affected energy metabolism and feeding behavior of zebrafish larvae, which presented high mortality rates at environmentally relevant concentrations.",2022,29,85172,85184,10.1007/s11356-022-21790-x
"Beier, F; Jedinger, M; Gruber, E; Zeller, JG",Temperature-Dependence of Glyphosate-Based Herbicide's Effects on Egg and Tadpole Growth of Common Toads,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Glyphosate-based herbicide formulations are broadly used in agriculture, silviculture, horticulture as well as in private gardens all over the world, thus posing the risk of potential contamination of nearby aquatic bodies inhabited by amphibians. Concurrently, climate change can be expected to alter the temperature of amphibian breeding sites. However, while either glyphosate-based herbicides or temperature have been shown to separately affect the development of amphibians, very little is known on possible interactive effects. We studied the impact of herbicide concentrations and temperature on growth and development of eggs and tadpoles of the Common toad (Bufo bufo L.). We hypothesized that (i) eggs would be better protected against herbicides than tadpoles because of their jelly coating, (ii) that higher temperatures would reduce potential herbicide effects because of an accelerated growth and a lower sensitivity of larger specimens. We conducted one experiment starting with eggs (Gosner stage, GS 8) and another experiment starting with tadpoles (GS 21-24) using a full factorial design with 5 concentrations of the herbicide formulation Roundup (R) LB Plus (0.0 mg acid equivalent L-1, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg a.e. L-1 and a pulse treatment with 3 times (egg experiment) or 5 times (tadpole experiment) addition of 0.5 a.e. mg L-1 over the course of several weeks) and two temperature levels (15 and 20 degrees C). Contrary to our expectation, our results showed that toad eggs are more sensitive to herbicides than tadpoles leading to an averaged 3196 increase in total length, tail length, and body length compared to the herbicide-free control. Tadpole morphology, development, or mortality was not influenced by herbicides. There was no correlation between herbicide concentration and the effect strength on eggs or tadpoles. Higher temperature accelerated growth of both eggs and tadpoles. As one of the first we also observed interactive effects between herbicide concentrations and temperature especially for egg development resulting in more pronounced herbicide effects at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This is quite remarkable as ecotoxicologial risk assessment studies are usually conducted at a constant temperature, thereby perhaps not adequately examining non-target effects at natural conditions.",2016,4,,,10.3389/fenvs.2016.00051
"Benbrook, CM",Trends in glyphosate herbicide use in the United States and globally,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background: Accurate pesticide use data are essential when studying the environmental and public health impacts of pesticide use. Since the mid-1990s, significant changes have occurred in when and how glyphosate herbicides are applied, and there has been a dramatic increase in the total volume applied. Methods: Data on glyphosate applications were collected from multiple sources and integrated into a dataset spanning agricultural, non-agricultural, and total glyphosate use from 1974-2014 in the United States, and from 1994-2014 globally. Results: Since 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19 % of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called Roundup Ready, genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10 years. The corresponding share globally is 72 %. In 2014, farmers sprayed enough glyphosate to apply similar to 1.0 kg/ha (0.8 pound/acre) on every hectare of U.S.-cultivated cropland and nearly 0.53 kg/ha (0.47 pounds/acre) on all cropland worldwide. Conclusions: Genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops now account for about 56 % of global glyphosate use. In the U.S., no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use. This is likely the case globally, but published global pesticide use data are sparse. Glyphosate will likely remain the most widely applied pesticide worldwide for years to come, and interest will grow in quantifying ecological and human health impacts. Accurate, accessible time-series data on glyphosate use will accelerate research progress.",2016,28,,,10.1186/s12302-016-0070-0

Many animals use defensive chemicals as protection from predators and diseases, yet the effects of chemical contaminants on this important fitness component are poorly known. Understanding such effects is especially relevant for amphibians, the globally most threatened group of vertebrates, because they are particularly vulnerable to chemical pollution. We conducted two experiments to investigate how exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides, the most widespread agrochemicals worldwide, affects the production of bufadienolides, the main compounds of chemical defence in common toads (Bufo bufo). In both experiments, herbicide exposure increased the amount of bufadienolides in toad tadpoles. In the laboratory, individuals exposed to 4 mg a.e./L glyphosate throughout their larval development had higher bufadienolide content at metamorphosis than nonexposed tadpoles, whereas exposure for 9 days to the same concentration or to 2 mg a. e./L throughout larval development or for 9 days had no detectable effect. In outdoormesocosms, tadpoles from 16 populations exhibited elevated bufadienolide content after three-weeks exposure to both concentrations of the herbicide. These results show that pesticide exposure can have unexpected effects on non-target organisms, with potential consequences for the conservation management of toxin-producing species and their predators.",2017,284,,,10.1098/rspb.2017.0493
"Bonfanti, P; Saibene, M; Bacchetta, R; Mantecca, P; Colombo, A",A glyphosate micro-emulsion formulation displays teratogenicity in Xenopus laevis,AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate is the active ingredient in broad-spectrum herbicide formulations used in agriculture, domestic area and aquatic weed control worldwide. Its market is growing steadily concurrently with the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops and emergence of weeds less sensitive to glyphosate. Ephemeral and lentic waters near to agricultural lands, representing favorite habitats for amphibian reproduction and early life-stage development, may thus be contaminated by glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs) residues. Previous studies on larval anuran species highlighted increased mortality and growth effects after exposure to different GBHs in comparison to glyphosate itself, mainly because of the surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the formulations. Nevertheless, these conclusions are not completely fulfilled when the early development, characterized by primary organogenesis events, is considered. In this study, we compare the embryotoxicity of Roundup((R)) Power 2.0, a new GBH formulation currently authorized in Italy, with that of technical grade glyphosate using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX). Our results evidenced that glyphosate was not embryolethal and only at the highest concentration (50 mg a.e./L) caused edemas. Conversely, Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 exhibited a 96 h LC50 of 24.78 mg a.e./L and a 96 h EC50 of 7.8 mg a.e./L. A Teratogenic Index of 3.4 was derived, pointing out the high teratogenic potential of the Roundup((R)) Power 2.0. Specific concentration-dependent abnormal phenotypes, such as craniofacial alterations, microphthalmia, narrow eyes and forebrain regionalization defects were evidenced by gross malformation screening and histopathological analysis. These phenotypes are coherent with those evidenced in Xenopus laevis embryos injected with glyphosate, allowing us to hypothesize that the teratogenicity observed for Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 may be related to the improved efficacy in delivering glyphosate to cells, guaranteed by the specific surfactant formulation. In conclusion, the differences in GBH formulations should be carefully considered by the authorities, since sub-lethal and/or long-term effects (e.g. teratogenicity) can be significantly modulated by the active ingredient salt type and concentration of the adjuvants. Finally, the mechanistic toxicity of glyphosate and GBHs are worthy of further research.",2018,195,103,113,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.12.007

Toxicity assays involved the Microtox (R) test, the T pyriformis population growth impairment test employing three different processes (flasks, tubes, microplates), and the T pyriformis nonspecific esterase activities test. Several IC50 or EC50 values are reported for each molecule. Alachlor exerted a toxic effect on the two nontarget cells used. The results for diuron and its photo and biotransformation products indicated that most of the metabolites presented nontarget toxicity higher than that of diuron. Glyphosate and AMPA had a less negative effect on T pyriformis than on V fischeri. Nevertheless, in all cases, glyphosate was found to be more toxic than AMPA. Comparison analysis of the sensitivity of the different tests showed that, in general, tests using the eukaryotic cell (T pyriformis) were more sensitive than test using the prokaryotic cell (V fischeri), and that a population growth criterion is more sensitive than an enzymatic criterion. The three different processes that could be used to evaluate effects on population growth rate were equally sensitive for the herbicides tested. A significant correlation between toxicity data and the hydrophobicity of the chemicals could only be established with the growth population test. This study demonstrates that it is essential to assess the toxicity of the metabolites formed to complete a more comprehensive study of the environmental impact of a polluting agent.

In this context, the influence of light adaptation on the response of freshwater biofilms to sudden light changes or to herbicides exposure was investigated by determining various parameters: diatom community composition, photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll a content, antioxidant enzyme activities. Biofilms were grown in microcosms under sub-optimal, saturating, and high light intensities and showed already described characteristics of shade/light adaptation (community structure, photosynthetic adaptation, etc.). Light history modulated antioxidant and photosynthetic responses of biofilms to the stress caused by short-term exposure to sudden light changes or to herbicides. First biofilms adapted to sub-optimal light intensity (shade-adapted) were found to be more sensitive to an increase in light intensity than high-light adapted ones to a reduction in light intensity. Second, while light history influenced biofilms' response to glyphosate, it had little influence on biofilms' response to copper and none on its response to oxyfluorfen. Indeed glyphosate exposure led to a stronger decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of shade-adapted biofilms (EC50 = 11.7 mg L-1) than of high-light adapted communities (EC50 = 35.6 mg L-1). Copper exposure led to an activation of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in biofilms adapted to sub-optimal and saturating light intensity while the protein content decreased in all biofilms exposed to copper. Oxyfluorfen toxicity was independent of light history provoking an increase in APX activity. In conclusion this study showed that both previous exposure to contaminants and physical habitat characteristics might influence community tolerance to disturbances strongly.",2012,21,1208,1224,10.1007/s10646-012-0876-5

"Borggaard, OK; Gimsing, AL",Fate of glyphosate in soil and the possibility of leaching to ground and surface waters: a review,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"The very wide use of glyphosate to control weeds in agricultural, silvicultural and urban areas throughout the world requires that special attention be paid to its possible transport from terrestrial to aquatic environments. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the state of knowledge on sorption, degradation and leachability of glyphosate in soils. Difficulties of drawing clear and unambiguous conclusions because of strong soil dependency and limited conclusive investigations are pointed out. Nevertheless, the risk of ground and surface water pollution by glyphosate seems limited because of sorption onto variable-charge soil minerals, e.g. aluminium and iron oxides, and because of microbial degradation. Although sorption and degradation are affected by many factors that might be expected to affect glyphosate mobility in soils, glyphosate leaching seems mainly determined by soil structure and rainfall. Limited leaching has been observed in non-structured sandy soils, while subsurface leaching to drainage systems was observed in a structured soil with preferential flow in macropores, but only when high rainfall followed glyphosate application. Glyphosate in drainage water runs into surface waters but not necessarily to groundwater because it may be sorbed and degraded in deeper soil layers before reaching the groundwater. Although the transport of glyphosate from land to water environments seems very limited, knowledge about subsurface leaching and surface runoff of glyphosate as well as the importance of this transport as related to ground and surface water quality is scarce.

Most methods developed up to now have employed pre-column or post-column derivatization to form fluorescent derivatives and/or to reduce the polar character of the analyte facilitating its chromatographic retention. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of performing the direct LC-MS/MS determination of GLY residues in vegetables. After testing several Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) columns, Obelisc N was selected due to its better chromatographic retention. LC-MS/MS determination has been performed in negative ionization mode, monitoring up to four transitions to give high reliability to the identification/confirmation process. This approach has been evaluated for the determination of GLY residues in rice, maize and soybean samples, and the method validated at different concentrations in compliance with the maximum residue limits established in the current legislation. After sample extraction with water, a combination of extract dilution, partition with dichloromethane, and solid phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB cartridges (depending on the sample matrix under analysis) was applied. Quantification was made by using isotope-labeled GLY as internal standard and calibration in solvent. The methodology developed allows the rapid determination of GLY residues avoiding the derivatization step typically applied for this herbicide. The most critical issue is the robustness of the Obelisc N column, which was found to suffer rapid degradation with time. Extreme care and continuous testing of retention times and peak shapes is required for a reliable determination. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Contamination of Amazon waters has increased as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure, including the use of herbicides as RD. The central goal of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of RD on juveniles of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). Our findings show that biomarkers in tambaqui are organ specific and dependent on RD concentration. Alterations in gills structural and respiratory epithelium were followed by changes in hematological parameters such as concentration of hemoglobin, particularly in fish exposed to the higher concentration tested (75% of RD LC50 96 h). In addition, both RD concentrations affected the biotransformation process in gills of tambaqui negatively. Instead, liver responses suggest that a production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred in fish exposed to RD, particularly in the animals exposed to 75% RD, as seen by imbalances in biotransformation and antioxidant systems. The increased DNA damage observed in red blood cells of tambaqui exposed to RD is in agreement with this hypothesis. Finally, both tested sub-lethal concentrations of RD markedly inhibited the cholinesterase activity in fish brain. Thus, we can suggest that RD is potentially toxic to tambaqui and possibly to other tropical fish species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup (R). This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio redo) is quickly gaining popularity in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages, and rapid development.

Zebrafish larvae at 3 days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) or Roundup (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) for 96 h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup' exposure when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5 mg/L, Roundup at 0.065 or 0.5 mg/L reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5 mg/L of Roundup-treated adult zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup (R) reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup', altering morphological and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity and cellular response.",2017,392,32,39,10.1016/j.tox.2017.10.007

The present study aimed to analyze the comprehensive toxicological effects of GLY on juvenile common carp and an epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cell line. In the in vivo experiments, exposure to GLY (5 and 15 mg/L) for 30 days induced liver inflammation and oxidative damage in common carp and changed the physical barrier of the intestine. Histopathological analysis of the intestine, liver, brain, and changes in oxidative stress biomarkers provided evidence of damage and immune system responses to GLY. Moreover, an inhibitory effect of 15 mg/L GLY on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was found in the brain, which may be an important reason for the significant decrease in both swimming distance and average acceleration of common carp. Cell experiments showed that 0.65 and 3.25 mg/L GLY inhibited the viability of EPCs. Furthermore, oxidative DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were observed in EPC cells following GLY exposure.

The endpoints evaluated were mortality, swimming activity, growth, development, and the presence of morphologic abnormalities, especially in the mouthparts. No lethal effects were observed on larvae exposed to GLY during either Gs-25 or Gs-36. The concentrations inducing 50 % lethality in RU-exposed larvae at different exposure times and Gss ranged from 3.26 to 9.61 mg a.e./L. Swimming activity was affected by only RU. Effects on growth and development and the induction of morphologic abnormalities-like oral abnormalities and edema-were observed after exposure to either GLY or RU. Gs-25 was the most sensitive stage to both forms of the herbicide. The commercial formulation was much more toxic than the active ingredient on all the endpoints assessed.

"Carles, L; Gardon, H; Joseph, L; Sanchís, J; Farré, M; Artigas, J",Meta-analysis of glyphosate contamination in surface waters and dissipation by biofilms,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,"One consequence of the intensive use of glyphosate is the contamination of rivers by the active substance and its metabolites aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) and sarcosine, inducing river eutrophication. Biofilms are the predominant lifestyle for microorganisms in rivers, providing pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning and pollutant removal. The persistence of glyphosate in these ecosystems is suspected to be mostly influenced by microbial biodegradation processes. The present study aimed to investigate the tripartite relationship among biofilms, phosphorus and glyphosate in rivers. The first part consists of a co-occurrence analysis among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus using an extensive dataset of measurements (n= 56,198) from French surface waters between 2013 and 2017. The second part investigated the capacity of natural river biofilms to dissipate glyphosate, depending on phosphorus availability and the exposure history of the biofilm, in a microcosm study. A strong co-occurrence among glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus was found in surface waters. More than two-thirds of samples contained phosphorous with glyphosate, AMPA or both compounds. Seasonal fluctuations in glyphosate, AMPA and phosphorus concentrations were correlated, peaking in spring/summer shortly after pesticide spreading. Laboratory experiments revealed that natural river biofilms can degrade glyphosate. However, phosphorus availability negatively influenced the biodegradation of glyphosate and induced the accumulation of AMPA in water. An increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and phosphorus uptake was observed in glyphosate-degrading biofilms, evidencing the tight link between phosphorus limitation and glyphosate degradation by biofilms. The results of the present study show that phosphorus not only is a key driver of river eutrophication but also can reduce complete glyphosate degradation by biofilms and favour the accumulation of AMPA in river water. The predominant role of biofilms and the trophic status of rivers must therefore be considered in order to better assess the fate and persistence of glyphosate.",2019,124,284,293,10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.064

Other serine hydrolases can be secondary OP targets, depending on the OP structure, and include neuropathy target esterase, lipases, and endocannabinoid hydrolases. The major OP herbicides are glyphosate and glufosinate, which act in plants but not animals to block aromatic amino acid and glutamine biosynthesis, respectively, with safety for crops conferred by their expression of herbicide-tolerant targets and detoxifying enzymes from bacteria. OP fungicides, pharmaceuticals including calcium retention agents, industrial chemicals, and cytochrome P450 inhibitors act by multiple noncholinergic mechanisms, often with high potency and specificity. One type of OP-containing fire retardant forms a highly toxic bicyclophosphate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist upon combustion.

We observed that the senile individuals presented 2-fold higher lipid peroxidation levels associated with the maintenance of superoxide dismutase and catalase activity levels even after exposure to the herbicide. However, senile subjects were negatively impacted by the exposure to formulations containing glyphosate, and this was related to a loss of glutathione S-transferase activity.

Studies on potential effects of glyphosate using environmentally relevant concentrations of AMPA on non-target wildlife species are lacking. We experimentally tested the effects of AMPA on embryonic development in a common European toad at concentrations spanning the range found in natural water bodies (from 0.07 to 3.57 mu g l(-1)). Our experimental concentrations of AMPA were 100-6000 times lower than official Predicted-No-Effect-Concentrations. We found that these low-level concentrations of AMPA decreased embryonic survival, increased development duration and influenced hatch ling morphology. Response patterns were more complex than classical linear concentration-response relationships, as concentration responses were nonmonotonic, with greater effects at low-concentrations of AMPA than at high levels.

F-v/F-m declined rapidly over <20 min in response to low concentrations of photosynthesis-specific herbicides Diuron (R) and metribuzin (both <40 nM), atrazine (<460 nM) and terbuthylazine (<400 nM). However, F-v/F-m also responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent way to toxins glyphosate (<90 mu M) and KCN (<1 mM) which have modes of action not specific to photosynthesis. F-v/F-m was insensitive to 30-40 mu M insecticides methyl parathion, carbofuran and malathion. Algal species varied in their sensitivity to toxins. No single species was the most sensitive to all nine toxins, but for six toxins to which algal F-v/F-m responded significantly, the model species P. subcapitata was less sensitive than other taxa. In terms of suppression of F-v/F-m within 80 min, patterns of concentration-dependence differed among toxins; most showed Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics, with half-saturation constant (K-m) values for the PSII inhibitors ranging from 0.14 mu M for Diuron (R) to 6.6 mu M for terbuthylazine, compared with a K-m of 330 mu M for KCN. Percent suppression of F-v/F-m by glyphosate increased exponentially with concentration. F-v/F-m provides a sensitive and easily-measured parameter for rapid and cost-effective detection of effects of many dissolved toxins.

Sediments from a prairie pothole wetland were collected, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze community composition 2-h and 14-days after a single treatment of low (0.07 ppm), medium (0.7 ppm), or high (7 ppm) glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (glyphosate metabolite), or a glyphosate-based commercial formula. We found no significant differences in microbial community composition across treatments, concentration levels, or day of sampling. These findings suggest that microbial species in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America may be tolerant to glyphosate exposure.",2023,86,2949,2958,10.1007/s00248-023-02296-6
"Coupe, RH; Kalkhoff, SJ; Capel, PD; Gregoire, C",Fate and transport of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid in surface waters of agricultural basins,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is a herbicide used widely throughout the world in the production of many crops and is heavily used on soybeans, corn and cotton. Glyphosate is used in almost all agricultural areas of the United States, and the agricultural use of glyphosate has increased from less than 10 000 Mg in 1992 to more than 80 000 Mg in 2007. The greatest intensity of glyphosate use is in the midwestern United States, where applications are predominantly to genetically modified corn and soybeans. In spite of the increase in usage across the United States, the characterization of the transport of glyphosate and its degradate aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) on a watershed scale is lacking. RESULTS: Glyphosate and AMPA were frequently detected in the surface waters of four agricultural basins. The frequency and magnitude of detections varied across basins, and the load, as a percentage of use, ranged from 0.009 to 0.86% and could be related to three general characteristics: source strength, rainfall runoff and flow route. CONCLUSIONS: Glyphosate use in a watershed results in some occurrence in surface water; however, the watersheds most at risk for the offsite transport of glyphosate are those with high application rates, rainfall that results in overland runoff and a flow route that does not include transport through the soil.

"Cuhra, M; Traavik, T; Bohn, T",Clone- and age-dependent toxicity of a glyphosate commercial formulation and its active ingredient in Daphnia magna,ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Low levels of glyphosate based herbicide induced significant negative effects on the aquatic invertebrate Daphnia magna. Glyphosate herbicides such as brands of Roundup, are known to be toxic to daphnids. However, published findings on acute toxicity show significant discrepancies and variation across several orders of magnitude. To test the acute effects of both glyphosate and a commercial formulation of Roundup (hereafter Roundup), we conducted a series of exposure experiments with different clones and age-classes of D. magna. The results demonstrated EC50 (48) values in the low ppm-range for Roundup as well as for the active ingredient (a.i.) isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (glyphosate IPA) alone. Roundup showed slightly lower acute toxicity than glyphosate IPA alone, i.e. EC50 values of 3.7-10.6 mg a.i./l, as compared to 1.4-7.2 mg a.i./l for glyphosate IPA. However, in chronic toxicity tests spanning the whole life-cycle, Roundup was more toxic. D. magna was exposed to sublethal nominal concentrations of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l for 55 days. Significant reduction of juvenile size was observed even in the lowest test concentrations of 0.05 mg a.i./l, for both glyphosate and Roundup. At 0.45 mg a.i./l, growth, fecundity and abortion rate was affected, but only in animals exposed to Roundup. At 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l of both glyphosate and Roundup, significant negative effects were seen on most tested parameters, including mortality. D. magna was adversely affected by a near 100 % abortion rate of eggs and embryonic stages at 1.35 mg a.i./l of Roundup. The results indicate that aquatic invertebrate ecology can be adversely affected by relevant ambient concentrations of this major herbicide. We conclude that glyphosate and Roundup toxicity to aquatic invertebrates have been underestimated and that current European Commission and US EPA toxicity classification of these chemicals need to be revised.",2013,22,251,262,10.1007/s10646-012-1021-1

Bacterioplankton communities are at the base of aquatic food webs, but their responses to these potentially interacting stressors are rarely explored. To test the extent of resistance and resilience in bacterioplankton communities faced with agricultural stressors, we exposed freshwater mesocosms to single and combined gradients of two commonly used pesticides: the herbicide glyphosate (0-15 mg/L) and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (0-60 mu g/L), in high or low nutrient backgrounds. Over the 43-day experiment, we tracked variation in bacterial density with flow cytometry, carbon substrate use with Biolog EcoPlates, and taxonomic diversity and composition with environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We show that only glyphosate (at the highest dose, 15 mg/L), but not imidacloprid, nutrients, or their interactions measurably changed community structure, favouring members of the Proteobacteria including the genus Agrobacterium. However, no change in carbon substrate use was detected throughout, suggesting functional redundancy despite taxonomic changes. We further show that communities are resilient at broad, but not fine taxonomic levels: 24 days after glyphosate application the precise amplicon sequence variants do not return, and tend to be replaced by phylogenetically close taxa. We conclude that high doses of glyphosate - but still within commonly acceptable regulatory guidelines - alter freshwater bacterioplankton by favouring a subset of higher taxonomic units (i.e., genus to phylum) that transiently thrive in the presence of glyphosate. Longer-term impacts of glyphosate at finer taxonomic resolution merit further investigation.",2021,30,4771,4788,10.1111/mec.16100

Acute toxicity interactions were analyzed with the Abbott method. In the chronic tests, the survival, growth, reproduction, and age at first brood were evaluated for the parents and the exposed (F1E) and non-exposed (F1NE) descendants. The scales tested for binary mixture, at the acute level, presented antagonistic and additive interactions, possibly associated with the complexation of the AgNPs by glyphosate. Multigenerational chronic effects related to the parameters, reproduction, and age at first brood were observed in the descendants tested with the individual compounds, with no recovery for F1E and F1NE. In organisms exposed to binary mixture, there was a delay in the age at first brood and also a significant change in the reproduction parameter, with a strong reduction for the parents, F1E, and F1NE, indicating a higher toxicity than the compounds tested individually. Although the results for acute interactions between AgNP and glyphosate did not provide clear evidence, multigenerational chronic binary mixture trials have resulted in unexpected toxicity compared with individual treatments, increasing the concerns associated with this co-exposure in other scenarios. Therefore, the interaction of binary mixture with the organisms merits further investigation and the results reported in the present study will be useful in this regard.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of the active ingredients of four of the main herbicides used in Brazilian sugarcane production to tadpoles of two tropical frog species: Physalaemus cuvieri and Hypsiboas pardalis. The calculated 96h-LC50 (median lethal concentration; in mg a.s./L) values for P. cuvieri and H. pardalis were 4.4 and 7.8 (acetochlor); 15 and <10 (ametryn); 115 and 106 (glyphosate); and 85 and 68 (metribuzin), respectively. These toxicity values demonstrated little interspecies variation and the toxicity of the herbicides appeared to be at least partly related with the respective octanol-water coefficient. Published acute toxicity data of fish and amphibians for herbicides were also compiled from the US-EPA ECOTOX database. These data indicated little difference in herbicide sensitivity between tropical amphibians and both non-tropical amphibians and fish. These findings indicate that temperate (fish and amphibian) herbicide toxicity data are also protective for tropical amphibians.

"Dabney, BL; Patiño, R","Low-dose stimulation of growth of the harmful alga, Prymnesium parvum, by glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides",HARMFUL ALGAE,"Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are widely used around the globe. While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus (R) (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III (R) (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0-1000 mu g glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l(-1)]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, similar to 50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10-1000 mu g glyphosate ae l-1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 mu g glyphosate l(-1), but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 mu g l(-1) influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments.",2018,80,130,139,10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.004
"Darmani, H; Al-Saleh, DRH",Lower Concentrations of the Glyphosate-Based Herbicide Roundup® Cause Developmental Defects in Artemia salina,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Roundup (R) is the most used glyphosate-based herbicide. During agricultural use it may directly contaminate existing aquatic ecosystems, posing severe concerns for the safety of nontarget terrestrial and aquatic organisms. We investigated the outcome of exposure to different concentrations of glyphosate in Roundup on cyst hatchability, toxicity, and teratogenic effects in the aquatic crustacean Artemia salina that inhabits diverse types of salt waters and, as a filter feeder, carries a greater risk of being exposed to pollutants. We found that exposure to 144 and 288 mu g/ml glyphosate in Roundup resulted in cysts unable to complete diapause, and hatchability was completely inhibited during all exposure times tested (17-48 h). A glyphosate concentration of 288 mu g/ml in Roundup was lethal to A. salina nauplii, and the lower concentrations (9, 18, 36, 72 mu g/ml) had no significant effects on viability. In addition, sublethal and environmentally safe concentrations of glyphosate (0.72 mu g/ml) in Roundup affected the early development of A. salina nauplii, with significantly decreased body lengths and reduced widths of the tail, abdomen, and head. The increased level of catalase activity observed in nauplii exposed to 0.72 mu g/ml glyphosate for 24 h and those exposed to 7.2 and 72 mu g/ml glyphosate for 48 h may be linked to excessive reactive oxygen species levels that had been induced by Roundup. In conclusion, Roundup containing >72 mu g/ml glyphosate totally inhibited hatching of cysts and exerted toxic effects on A. salina nauplii. The increased prevalence of developmental defects in the nauplii observed at 0.72 mu g/ml glyphosate signifies possible teratogenicity of Roundup exposure even at environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate, possibly due to disturbance of the antioxidant defenses, which needs further investigation.

After exposure for 8 days to herbicide, fish were transferred to clean water for a recovery response period (also 8 days). Herbicide increased thiobarbituric acid reactive species in liver and muscle at the higher concentration and in the brain at both concentrations. Protein carbonyl in liver increased after exposure. Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and ascorbic acid levels in liver did not change in fish exposed to both concentrations. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels decreased at both concentrations. The nonprotein thiol levels decreased at the 0.95 mg/l concentration. During the recovery period, some of the parameters that had altered, such as protein carbonyl content, later recovered. However, some enzymes reacted during this period, e. g., GST increased its activity, possibly indicating a compensatory response against the toxic conditions. In contrast, CAT and SOD activities decreased during the recovery period, indicating herbicide toxicity. Oxidative stress that occurred during the exposure period was likely due to the increased lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content.

This study aimed to investigate the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of co-exposure of IONPs (gamma-Fe2O3 NPs) and glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) in the fish Poecilia reticulata.

The genotoxicity (DNA damage) was analyzed by comet assay, while the mutagenicity evaluated by micronucleus test (MN test) and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) frequency. The coexposure induced clastogenic (DNA damage) and aneugenic (nuclear alterations) effects on guppies in a timedependent pattern. Fish co-exposed to NPs and GBH (130 mu g glyphosate L-1) showed high DNA damage when compared to NPs alone and control group, indicating synergic effects after 21 days of exposure. However, mutagenic effects (ENA) were observed in the exposure groups after 14 and 21 days.

Glyphosate, directly or indirectly, contaminates freshwater systems which in turn may be invaded by the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Under laboratory conditions, we studied the combined effect of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R), in scenarios with and without L. fortunei, on phytoplankton from Salto Grande Reservoir (Uruguay River, Argentina). We expected that the effects of the interaction on phytoplankton and water quality would vary with the form of herbicide applied. The assay was conducted for 14 days (TO using 3-L bottles as experimental units. Eight treatments were performed in triplicate: C: Control; M: mussel; G: technical grade glyphosate acid; R: Roundup Max (R); Glifosato Atanor (R); MG: mussel + technical-grade glyphosate acid, MA: mussel + Glifosato Atanor (R) and MR: mussel + Roundup Max (R). The active ingredient was applied at 6 ppm. The dissipation of glyphosate in water was 1.5-2.6 times higher in presence of mussels. Treatments G and A showed an increase in phytoplankton abundance, mainly the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. with rised to 289% and 639% at Tf, respectively, relative to their values at Ti. Roundup Max (R) limited the growth of Microcystis spp., as its abundance decreased 59% relative to Ti. L. fortunei reduced phytoplankton abundances at Tf. Evenness increased significantly in M, MG, MR and MA, while it decreased in G, R and A relative to C.

Thus, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) substantially add to the environmental load of pesticides and warrant a strict risk assessment. Ecotoxicological testing of herbicides focuses on non-target plants and higher animals while direct effects on arthropods are only cur-sory tested on the premise of contact exposure. However, oral exposure, as we show in our case, can be highly relevant for systemic pesticides, such as GBH. Specifically, in crop systems including genetically modified crops that are tolerant to GBH, these herbicides and their breakdown products are present both internally and externally of the crop plants and, therefore, are ingested by the crop-associated arthropod fauna. We tested the effects of oral uptake of the Roundup formulation WeatherMax on larvae of the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, a model organism in ecotoxicity testing programs. Long-term oral exposure of C. carnea larvae throughout its juvenile life stages was tested with concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 % dilution, thus, lower than the 1.67 % recommended for field applications. Inhibition of metamorphosis was observable at 0.1 % but at a concentra-tion of 0.5 %, GBH significantly impaired cocoon formation and led to massive lethal malformations. At GBH concen-tration of 1 % half of the individuals remained permanent larvae and no adult hatched alive. The effects observed followed a clear dose-response relationship. The hazard caused by direct insecticidal action of GHB after oral uptake is highly relevant for the environmental safety and reveals a gap in regulatory risk assessments that should urgently be addressed, specifically in light of the on-going insect decline.",2023,865,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161158

To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36-48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10-20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants.

We tested the endocrine disruption of co-formulants in six glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), the most used pesticides worldwide. All co-formulants and formulations were comparably cytotoxic well below the agricultural dilution of 1% (18-2000 times for co-formulants, 8-141 times for formulations), and not the declared active ingredient glyphosate (G) alone. The endocrine-disrupting effects of all these compounds were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme in the balance of sex hormones, below the toxicity threshold. Aromatase activity was decreased both by the co-formulants alone (polyethoxylated tallow amine-POEA and alkyl polyglucoside-APG) and by the formulations, from concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1/3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated for the first time that endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to co-formulants.

"Di Guardo, A; Finizio, A",A new methodology to identify surface water bodies at risk by using pesticide monitoring data: The glyphosate case study in Lombardy Region (Italy),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"In the last decades, several monitoring programs were established as an effect of EU Directives addressing the quality of water resources (drinking water, groundwater and surface water). Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are an obvious target of monitoring activities, since they are directly released into the environment. One of the challenges in managing the risk of pesticides at the territorial scale is identifying the locations in water bodies needing implementation of risk mitigation measures. In this, the national pesticides monitoring plans could be very helpful. However, monitoring of pesticides is a challenging task because of the high number of registered pesticides, cost of analyses, and the periodicity of sampling related to pesticide application and use. Extensive high-quality data-sets are consequently often missing. More in general, the information that can be obtained from monitoring studies are frequently undervalued by risk managers. In this study, we propose a new methodology providing indications about the need to implement mitigation measures in stretches of surface water bodies on a territory by combining historical series of monitoring data and GIS. The methodology is articulated in two distinct phases: a) acquisition of monitoring data and setting-up of informative layers of georeferenced data (phase 1) and b) statistical and expert analysis for the identification of areaswhere implementation of limitation or mitigation measures are suggested (phase 2). Our methodology identifies potentially vulnerable water bodies, considering temporal contamination trends and relative risk levels at selected monitoring stations.

"Drzyzga, D; Lipok, J",Glyphosate dose modulates the uptake of inorganic phosphate by freshwater cyanobacteria,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY,"The usefulness of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] as a source of nutritive phosphorus for species of halophilic cyanobacteria has been postulated for years. Our results indicate a stimulating effect of glyphosate on the growth of four out of five examined freshwater species, Anabaena variabilis (CCALA 007), Chroococcus minutus (CCALA 055), Fischerella cf. maior (CCALA 067) and Nostoc cf. muscorum (CCALA 129), in a manner dependent on the applied concentration. The most significant stimulation was observed at a dose of 0.1 mM glyphosate. The decrease in the amount of phosphonate, which correlated with microbial growth, demonstrated that glyphosate may play an important role in cyanobacterial nourishment. Surprisingly, the consumption of organic phosphorus did not start when concentrations of inorganic phosphate (PO4 (3-)) had fallen dramatically; instead, the assimilation of both types of phosphorus occurred simultaneously. The greatest decrease in the amount of glyphosate was observed during the first week. The uptake of the standard nutrient-phosphate (PO4 (3-)), was strongly dependent on the xenobiotic concentration. When a concentration of 0.1 mM glyphosate was used, the consumption of phosphate decreased in favour of glyphosate assimilation. Our study revealed for the very first time that the presence of inorganic phosphate significantly enhances the bioavailability of glyphosate. Statistical analysis confirmed that the nutritive usage of glyphosate and the absorption of phosphate are features associated with the herbicide concentration rather than features related to the species of freshwater cyanobacterium. This finding supports the thesis of an important role of organic phosphorus in the formation of cyanobacterial blooms and creates the opportunity of using these cyanobacteria to bind both organic and inorganic forms of phosphorus in microalgal biomasses.",2018,30,299,309,10.1007/s10811-017-1231-2
"Duke, SO; Powles, SB",Glyphosate: a once-in-a-century herbicide,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Since its commercial introduction in 1974, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] has become the dominant herbicide worldwide. There are several reasons for its success. Glyphosate is a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide, yet it is very toxicologically and environmentally safe. Glyphosate translocates well, and its action is slow enough to take advantage of this. Glyphosate is the only herbicide that targets 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), so there are no competing herbicide analogs or classes. Since glyphosate became a generic compound, its cost has dropped dramatically. Perhaps the most important aspect of the success of glyphosate has been the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops in 1996. Almost 90% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide are glyphosate resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing at a steady pace. Glyphosate/glyphosate-resistant crop weed management offers significant environmental and other benefits over the technologies that it replaces. The use of this virtually ideal herbicide is now being threatened by the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Adoption of resistance management practices will be required to maintain the benefits of glyphosate technologies for future generations.

Using a replicated, whole ecosystem experiment in which 24 small wetlands were split in half with an impermeable barrier we tested whether exposure to a glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup WeatherMax (TM), alone or in combination with nutrient enrichment has an effect on the survival, growth or development of amphibians. The herbicide was applied at one of two concentrations (low=210 mu g a.e./L, high=2880 mu g a.e./L) alone and in combination with nutrient enrichment to one side of wetlands and the other was left as an untreated control. Each treatment was replicated with six wetlands, and the experiment was repeated over two years. In the high glyphosate and nutrient enrichment treatment the survival of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) larvae was lower in enclosures placed in situ on the treated sides than the control sides of wetlands. However, these results were not replicated in the second year of study and they were not observed in free swimming wood frog larvae in the wetlands. In all treatments, wood frog larvae on the treated sides of wetlands were slightly larger (<10%) than those on the control side, but no effect on development was observed. The most dramatic finding was that the abundance of green frog larvae (Lithobates clamitans) was higher on the treated sides than the control sides of wetlands in the herbicide and nutrient treatments during the second year of the study. The results observed in this field study indicate that caution is necessary when extrapolating results from artificial systems to predict effects in natural systems. In this experiment, the lack of toxicity to amphibian larvae was probably due to the fact the pH of the wetlands was relatively low and the presence of sediments and organic surfaces which would have mitigated the exposure duration.

"Evans, SC; Shaw, EM; Rypstra, AL",Exposure to a glyphosate-based herbicide affects agrobiont predatory arthropod behaviour and long-term survival,ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Humans commonly apply chemicals to manage agroecosystems. If those chemicals influence the behaviour or survival of non-target arthropods, the food web could be altered in unintended ways. Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the most ubiquitous pesticides used around the world, yet little is known about if and how they might affect the success of terrestrial predatory arthropods in agroecosystems. In this study, we quantified the effects of a commercial formulation of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of three predatory arthropod species that inhabit agricultural fields in the eastern United States. We also measured the survival of the most common species. We tested the reactions of the wolf spider, Pardon, milvina, to either direct application (topical) or contact with a treated substrate (residual). We quantified the reactions of a larger wolf spider, Hogna helluo, and a ground beetle, Scarites quadriceps, to a compound (topical plus residual) exposure. Pardosa milvina reduced locomotion time and distance under topical herbicide exposure, but increased speed and non-locomotory activity time on exposed substrate. Both H. helluo and S. quadriceps increased non-locomotory activity time under compound herbicide exposure. Over a period of 60 days post-exposure, residually exposed P. milvina exhibited lower survivorship compared to topically exposed and control groups. Thus, exposure of terrestrial arthropods to glyphosate-based herbicides affects their behaviour and long-term survival. These results suggest that herbicides can affect arthropod community dynamics separate from their impact on the plant community and may influence biological control in agroecosystems.",2010,19,1249,1257,10.1007/s10646-010-0509-9

Both pesticides have been registered in freshwater bodies of the region. One of the most abundant and widely distributed fish species in Pampean streams is Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, which have to cope with this altered scenario. In the present study the toxicity of Clorfox (R) and Roundup Max (R), the commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos and glyphosate, respectively, and their mixture where evaluated using a set of biomarkers at different biological organization levels in fish exposed to relevant environmentally pesticides concentrations. Somatic indexes such as the condition factor (K), and the hepato-somatic index (HSI), the locomotor activity through the distance traveled and the average speed, the enzymatic activities of acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) in brain and muscle, catalase (CAT) in muscle and liver, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in brain, liver, muscle and gills, aspartate amino-transferase (AST), alanine amino-transferase (ALT), AST/ALT ratio and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in liver were measured on C decemmaculatus. Adult females were exposed during 6 weeks to the following concentrations: 0.0084 mu l/l and 0.00084 mu l/l of Clorfox (CF), 0.2 and 2 mg/1 of Roundup Max (RM) and all the combinations of these concentrations. The CF exposure caused a decrease in the condition factor and in the locomotor activity parameters and induced an increase brain AChE, liver CAT activity and AST/ALT ratio. On the other hand, the exposure to RM produced a decrease in liver GST, AST/ALT ratio and ALP activity. Finally, some pesticide combinations decrease general condition and liver GST activities, and increase brain GST and liver ALP activities. Different responses in biomarkers were observed in mixtures treatments, reflecting the complex interactions between these toxics and suggesting a suppressive action of RM on CF effects. Since the concentrations we tested are environmentally relevant and the overall fish health condition was affected, the presence of these pesticides in freshwater systems could impose a risk for populations by causing deleterious effects on C. decemmaculatus in Pampean region.

After 21 days, antioxidant capacity (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), malondialdehyde content (MDA), and fatty acid (FA) composition of Lymnaea sp. tissue were measured. Temperature had an effect on SOD activity and GPx activity. In contrast, an increase in GST activity was observed in glyphosate-exposed snails, highlighting the role of GST in the glyphosate detoxification process. Differences in temperature and glyphosate did not affect lipid peroxidation (MDA); however, we observed a trend suggesting the presence of higher MDA content in glyphosate-exposed snails at 20 degrees C. The FA groups were generally not strongly affected by the treatments, except for omega-9 (n-9) that was markedly lower at the higher temperature. Changes were also observed in individual FA as a response to glyphosate and/or temperature. For example, a significant decrease in 18:1n9 was observed at 25 degrees C.

Contamination of surface water by glyphosate-based herbicides can cause deleterious effects in organisms, mainly in aquatic systems near to intensive agricultural areas (e.g., transgenic soybean crops). Given the lack of toxicological information concerning effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on tropical aquatic ecosystems, we aimed to evaluate the lethal and sub-lethal effects of Roundup Original (R) on the dipteran Chironomus xanthus. The endpoints evaluated included survival, growth, and emergence. The results showed that the 48 h LC50 for glyphosate to C. xanthus was 251.5 mg a.e./L. Larval growth of C. xanthus was reduced under glyphosate exposure (LOEC for body length = 12.06 mg/L; LOEC for head capsule width = 0.49 mg/L). No effects were observed in terms of cumulative percentage of imagoes emergence. However, low concentrations of glyphosate caused delayed emergence of females (at 1.53 mg/L) and induced fast emergence of males (at 0.49 mg/L), compared to control treatment. The deleterious effects of environmental relevant concentrations of glyphosate (0.7 mg/L) observed in terms of C. xanthus growth and development suggest that glyphosate-based herbicides can have negative consequences for aquatic nontarget invertebrates such as Chironomus. Multigerational assays are needed to assess the long term effects of glyphosate on C. xanthus populations.

One reason might be the use of pesticides including herbicides. The herbicide glyphosate is an inhibitor of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase of the plant shikimate pathway, preventing the formation of aromatic amino acids and thus inducing plant death. Due to this specific action, GBH are considered nontoxic to non-target organisms. However, GBH impairs embryonic development of chickens, amphibians and fishes. So far, no detailed tissue- and organ-specific analysis of the effects of GBH during development in amphibians has been performed. Results: We demonstrated that GBH Roundup (R) LB plus has a negative effect on embryonic development of the South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. GBH treatment with sublethal concentrations resulted in a reduced body length and mobility of embryos. Furthermore, incubation with GBH led to smaller eyes, brains and cranial cartilages in comparison to untreated embryos. GBH incubation also resulted in shorter cranial nerves and had an effect on cardiac development including reduced heart rate and atrium size. On a molecular basis, GBH treatment led to reduced expression of marker genes in different tissues and developmental stages.

Anthropogenic stressors can disrupt such natural hatching dynamics. This work examines the effects of concentrations ranging from 1 to 8 mg l(-1) of a commercial glyphosate-based formulation (Sulfosato Touchdowns) on the hatching dynamics of zooplankton dormant stages, present in the sediment of a natural lake. Sediment samples were collected from the surface sediment (<10 cm deep) of an isolated shallow lake free from pesticide pollution. An ex situ emergence assessment method was carried out and four treatments plus one control (without pesticide) were performed with three replicate each. Zooplankton hatching from the resting stages was monitored during 30 days. In total, 30 zooplankton taxa were recognized. The species diversity decreased significantly at concentration above 2.7 mg l(-1) glyphosate. The proportion of cladocerans within hatchling organisms decreased, while that of rotifers Bdelloidea increased in all treatments with glyphosate. Time of the first hatching (TFH), time of maximum hatching (TMH) and the frequency of hatchings (FH) of most zooplankton species were also altered. In conclusion, the application of a glyphosate-based pesticide selectively affected the hatching dynamic of zooplankton egg banks, which suggest that these resting structures are highly sensitive to the toxicity of the pesticide.

However, their transport through the soil, by leaching and/or runoff, may cause them to reach aquatic systems. Environmental parameters, such as soil pH, can affect this transport, by influencing the magnitude of agrochemicals degradation and chemical reaction. This work aimed at investigating the influence of soil pH on the toxicity of eluates obtained from Basamid (R) contaminated soils to Hydra viridissima, Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio. For this, a natural soil with pH amended to 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5, was spiked with the recommended dose (RD) of Basamid (R) (145 mg dazomet/kg soil) and eluates (Ba-E) were prepared with the respective species culture medium.

Larval salamanders were exposed to 1 of 4 environmentally relevant glyphosate concentrations (0.00 mu g acid equivalent [a.e.]/L, 0.73 mu g a.e./L, 1.46 mu g a.e./L, and 2.92 mu g a.e./L) at either ambient (12 degrees C) or elevated (23 degrees C) water temperature. Behaviors observed included the exploration of a novel habitat, use of refuge, habitat selection relative to a potential predator, and burst movement distance. In the absence of glyphosate, temperature consistently affected movement and refuge-use behavior, with individuals moving longer distances more frequently and using refuge less at warm temperatures; however, when glyphosate was added, the authors observed inconsistent effects of temperature that may have resulted from differential toxicity at various temperatures. Larval salamanders made shorter, more frequent movements and demonstrated reduced burst distance at higher glyphosate concentrations. The authors also found that lower glyphosate concentrations sometimes had stronger effects than higher concentrations (i.e., nonmonotonic dose responses), suggesting that standard safety tests conducted only at higher glyphosate concentrations might overlook important sublethal effects on salamander behavior. These data demonstrate that sublethal effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on natural behaviors of amphibians can occur with short-term exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations.

However, GBH encompass a variety of glyphosate salts as active ingredient and different adjuvants, which differ between products. These herbicides reach water bodies and produce diverse impacts over aquatic communities. Yet, the risk assessment assays required for the approval focus mostly on active ingredients. Herein, we compared the effect of five different GBH as well as of monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA) on aquatic microbial communities from natural shallow lakes that were mixed and allowed to evolve in an outdoor pond. We performed an 8-day long assay under indoor control conditions to evaluate the effects of exposure on the structure of nano-plus microphytoplankton (net phytoplankton, with sizes between 2 and 20 mu m and >20 mu m, respectively) and picoplankton (size ranging between 0.2 and 2 mu m) communities through microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Significantly different effects were evident on the structure of microbial communities dependent on the GBH, even with herbicides sharing similar active ingredients. Each GBH evoked increases of different magnitude in bacterioplankton abundance. Furthermore, GIPA and a formulation decreased the abundance of a phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) picocyanobacteria (Pcy) cytometric population and GIPA further altered Pcy composition. Also, two GBH increased net phytoplankton total abundance and, unlike the tested GBH, no apparent effect of GIPA was detected on this community structure. These results demonstrate that GBH effects on aquatic microbial communities should not be summarized as glyphosate effects considering that the formulations have effects beyond those exerted by the active ingredients alone. This work intends to alert on the lack of real knowledge regarding the consequences of the variety of GBH on natural aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, the wide use of the term glyphosate effect should be thoroughly rethought.",2022,292,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118382

We investigated how the combination of the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei and a widely applied herbicide, Roundup Max (R), affected freshwater microscopic communities and water quality. Further, we compared these results with those induced by the combination of the mussel and technical-grade glyphosate. We carried out a 34-day experiment in outdoor mesocosms, applying the following six treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), the equivalent concentration of glyphosate in Roundup Max (R) (R), 100 mussels (M), the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade or formulated form (MG and MR, respectively), and control (C). Herbicides significantly increased total phosphorus in water; R and MR showed greater initial total nitrogen and ammonium. R increased picoplankton abundance and caused an eightfold increase in phytoplankton, with high turbidity values; G had a lower effect on these variables. Herbicide-mussel combination induced an accelerated dissipation of glyphosate in water (MG 6.36 +/- 0.83 mg G g DW-1 day(-1) and MR 5.16 +/- 1.26 mg G g DW-1 day(-1)). A synergistic effect on ammonium was observed in MR but not in MG. MR and MG had an antagonistic effect on phytoplankton, which showed a drastic reduction due to grazing, as revealed by M. We provide evidence of differential effects of Roundup Max (R) and technical-grade glyphosate over water quality and microscopic communities, and in combination with mussels. However, in the combination of mussels and herbicides, mussels seem to play a leading role. In the presence of L. fortunei, the effects of higher nutrient availability provided by herbicides addition were counteracted by the filtration activity of mussels, which released nutrients, grazed on picoplankton and phytoplankton, and boosted the development of other primary producers, periphyton and metaphyton.",2016,23,18869,18882,10.1007/s11356-016-7005-6

"Giommi, C; Ladisa, C; Carnevali, O; Maradonna, F; Habibi, HR",Metabolomic and Transcript Analysis Revealed a Sex-Specific Effect of Glyphosate in Zebrafish Liver,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,"Glyphosate is a component of commonly used herbicides for controlling weeds in crops, gardens and municipal parks. There is increasing awareness that glyphosate-based herbicides, in addition to acting on plants, may also exert toxicity in wildlife and humans. In this study, male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to 700 mu g/L of glyphosate (GLY), for 28 days. We used the metabolomic approach and UHPLC-ESI-MS to analyze liver samples to investigate the adverse effects of glyphosate on hepatic metabolism. The impact of GLY was found to be sex-specific. In female, GLY exposure affected purine metabolism by decreasing the levels of AMP, GMP and inosinic acid, consequently increasing uric acid levels with respect to the control (CTRL). Exposure to GLY also caused a decrease of UMP levels in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In male, GLY exposure decreased the aminoadipic acid within the lysine degradation pathway. Transcript analysis of genes involved in stress response, oxidative stress and the immune system were also performed. Results demonstrated an increased stress response in both sexes, as suggested by higher nr3c1 expression. However, the hsp70.2 transcript level was increased in female but decreased in male. The results demonstrated reduced sod1, sod2, and gpx1a in male following exposure to GLY, indicating an impaired oxidative stress response. At the same time, an increase in the cat transcript level in female was observed. mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukins litaf and cxcl8b.1 were increased in female. Taken together, the results provide evidence of disrupted nucleotide hepatic metabolism, increased stress inflammatory response in female and disruption of oxidative stress response in male.",2022,23,,,10.3390/ijms23052724

Sixty-day-old plants grown under greenhouse conditions were sprayed with different rates (0, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.8 kg a.e ha(-1)) of the commercial glyphosate formulated salt Factor (R) 540. Evaluations were performed at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after herbicide exposure. We established that the herbicide decreases chlorophyll, carotenoid and plastoquinone contents, and promotes changes in the photosynthetic apparatus leading to decreased photochemistry which results in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation. H2O2 accumulation triggers proline production which can be associated with oxidative protection, NADP(+) recovery and shikimate pathway stimulation. Ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase appeared to be the main peroxidases involved in the H2O2 scavenging. In addition to promoting decreases of the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, the herbicide induced decreases in ascorbate pool. For the first time, a glyphosate-based herbicide mode of action interconnecting its effects on shikimate pathway, photosynthetic process and oxidative events in plants were presented.",2017,8,,,10.3389/fpls.2017.00207
"Gomes, MP; Freitas, PL; Kitamura, RSA; Pereira, EG; Juneau, P","How aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the main glyphosate metabolite, interferes with chlorophyll biosynthesis?",ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,"Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) has been proposed to interfere with chlorophyll biosynthesis in photo-autotrophic organisms - which may explain its greater toxicity to plants in relation to animals. By using the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor, we investigated the AMPA toxicity and its effects on chlorophyll biosynthesis. Environmentally relevant concentrations (35-50 mu g l(-1)) of AMPA reduced L. minor chlorophyll concentration with an EC10 and EC50 of 1.3 and 902.9 mu g AMPA l(-1) after seven days of exposure respectively but did not affect plant fresh weight/growth rate (EC10 and EC50 of 178.6/244.4 and 11,922.2/12,513.2 mu g AMPA l(-1), respectively). AMPA decreased the activity of glycine decarboxylase (GDC), leading to glycine accumulation and glutamate (Glu) deprivation in plants. The lack of Glu prevents the synthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in chloroplasts, interfering on chlorophyll synthesis. The negative effect of AMPA on chlorophyll concentration was reversible by supplementing growth media with Glu or ALA. The presence of AMPA in the aquatic ecosystems may contribute to their alteration by its negative effects on photosynthetic organisms through chlorophyll biosynthesis inhibition. Furthermore, we should stress out that AMPA could be toxic for animals and humans due to known toxicity of glycine induced by GDC inhibition.",2022,203,,,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2022.105039
"Gomes, MP; Juneau, P",Temperature and Light Modulation of Herbicide Toxicity on Algal and Cyanobacterial Physiology,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"HIGHLIGHTS We reviewed the interaction between light, temperature and herbicides on algal and cyanobacterial physiology. Temperature is the main factor affecting herbicide toxicity to algae and cyanobacteria. Changes in light environment may modulate the effects of photosynthesis-targeting herbicides. Important interactions between climatic parameters and herbicide toxicity have been discussed in the literature. As climate changes are expected to influence the growth conditions of aquatic photosynthetic organisms over the next century by modifying the physicochemical parameters of the environment (such as temperature and incident light characteristics), the following questions arise: How will variations in climatic conditions influence herbicide toxicity in algae and cyanobacteria? Are these coupled effects on aquatic photosynthetic organism physiology antagonistic, additive, or synergistic? We discuss here the physiological responses of algae and cyanobacteria to the combined effects of environmental changes (temperature and light) and herbicide exposure. Both temperature and light are proposed to influence herbicide toxicity through acclimation processes that are mainly related to cell size and photosynthesis. Algal and cyanobacterial responses to interactions between light, temperature, and herbicides are species-specific, making it difficult today to establish a single model of how climate changes will affect toxicity of herbicides. Acclimation processes could assure the maintenance of primary production but total biodiversity should decrease in communities exposed to herbicides under changing temperature and light conditions. The inclusion of considerations on the impacts of environmental changes on toxicity of herbicides in water quality guidelines directed toward protecting aquatic life is now urgently needed.",2017,5,,,10.3389/fenvs.2017.00050

Willow plants were treated with different concentrations of glyphosate (equivalent to 0, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.8 kg ha(-1)) and AMPA (equivalent to 0, 0.28,1.4 and 2.8 kg ha(-1)) and evaluations of pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence, and oxidative stress markers (hydrogen peroxide content and antioxidant enzyme activities) in leaves were performed after 12 h of exposure. We observed that AMPA and glyphosate trigger different mechanisms leading to decreases in chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rates in willow plants. Both chemicals induced ROS accumulation in willow leaves although only glyphosate-induced oxidative damage through lipid peroxidation. By disturbing chlorophyll biosynthesis, AMPA induced decreases in chlorophyll contents, with consequent effects on photosynthesis. With glyphosate, ROS increases were higher than the ROS-sensitive threshold, provoking chlorophyll degradation (as seen by pheophytin accumulation) and invariable decreases in photosynthesis. Peroxide accumulation in both AMPA and glyphosate-treated plants was due to the inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities. The different effects of glyphosate on chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis as described in the literature may be due to various glyphosate:AMPA ratios in those plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A laboratory bioassay was carried out with four treatments: technical-grade glyphosate acid, Glifosato II Atanor (R), Roundup Max (R), at a concentration of 3 mg active ingredient/L, and Control. At 2, 5 and 9 days after herbicide application, pigments concentration, dry weight, ash-free dry weight, and periphytic algal density were determined. An increase of Cyanobacteria and a decrease of Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta abundances were registered in all treatments with the herbicide.

Two applications of glyphosate provided better weed control than a single application, especially when applied to weeds 10 cm or less in early-planted corn. Yield was reduced occasionally with a single application on 5- or 10-cm weeds, because of weed re-infestation. Failure to control weeds before they reached a height of 15 to 30 cm also resulted in occasional yield loss. Application of atrazine or acetochlor plus atrazine prior to glyphosate did not consistently increase weed control or yield. Results suggested that glyphosate should be applied before weeds reach 15 cm in height to avoid corn grain yield loss.",2002,16,488,494,10.1614/0890-037X(2002)016[0488:EOPDRH]2.0.CO;2

Massive use of the parent compounds leads to the ubiquity of AMPA in the environment, and particularly in water. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss current insights into AMPA formation, transport, persistence and toxicity. In agricultural soils, AMPA is concentrated in the topsoil, and degrades slowly in most soils. It can reach shallow groundwater, but rarely managed to enter deep groundwater. AMPA is strongly adsorbed to soil particles and moves with the particles towards the stream in rainfall runoff. In urban areas, AMPA comes from phosphonates and glyphosate in wastewater. It is commonly found at the outlets of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). Sediments tend to accumulate AMPA, where it may be biodegraded. Airborne AMPA is not negligible, but does wash-out with heavy rainfall. AMPA is reported to be persistent and can be biologically degraded in soils and sediments. Limited photodegradation in waters exists. AMPA mainly has its sources in agricultural leachates, and urban wastewater effluents. The domestic contribution to urban loads is negligible. There is a critical lack of epidemiological data- especially on water exposure- to understand the toxicological effects, if any, of AMPA on humans. Fortunately, well operated water treatment plants remove a significant proportion of the AMPA from water, even though there are not sufficient regulatory limits for metabolites.

However, the knowledge on the genotoxicity of pesticides to fish is still limited. Moreover, genotoxic studies have been almost exclusively focused on the active ingredients, whereas the effect of adjuvants is frequently ignored. Hence, the present study addressed the herbicide Roundup(A (R)), evaluating the relative contribution of the active ingredient (glyphosate) and the surfactant (polyethoxylated amine; POEA) to the genotoxicity of the commercial formulation on Anguilla anguilla. Fish were exposed to equivalent concentrations of Roundup(A (R)) (58, 116 mu g L-1), glyphosate (17.9, 35.7 mu g L-1) and POEA (9.3, 18.6 mu g L-1), during 1 and 3 days. The comet assay was applied to blood cells, either as the standard procedure, or with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes in an attempt to clarify DNA damaging mechanisms. The results confirmed the genotoxicity of Roundup(A (R)), also demonstrating the genotoxic potential of glyphosate and POEA individually. Though both components contributed to the overall genotoxicity of the pesticide formulation, the sum of their individual effects was never observed, pointing out an antagonistic interaction. Although POEA is far from being considered biologically inert, it did not increase the risk associated to glyphosate when the two were combined. The analysis of oxidatively induced breaks suggested that oxidation of DNA bases was not a dominant mechanism of damage. The present findings highlighted the risk posed to fish populations by the assessed chemicals, jointly or individually, emphasizing the need to define regulatory thresholds for all the formulation components and recommending, in particular, the revision of the hazard classification of POEA.",2012,21,1381,1390,10.1007/s10646-012-0892-5

Agricultural as well as urban use was surveyed in all sub-catchments allowing for a detailed interpretation of the monitoring results. Water samples from the river system and from the urban drainage system (combined sewer overflow, storm sewer and outflow of wastewater treatment plant) were investigated. The concentrations at peak discharge during storm events were elevated throughout the year with maximum concentrations of 4.15 mu g L-1. Glyphosate concentrations mostly exceeded those of other commonly used herbicides such as atrazine or mecoprop Fast runoff from hard surfaces led to a fast increase of the glyphosate concentration shortly after the beginning of rainfall not coinciding with the concentration peak normally observed from agricultural fields. The comparison of the agricultural application and the seasonal concentration and load pattern in the main creek from March to November revealed that the occurrence of glyphosate cannot be explained by agricultural use only. Extrapolations from agricultural loss rates and from concentrations found in the urban drainage system showed that more than half of the load during selected rain events originates from urban areas The inputs from the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant, the overflow of the combined sewer system and of the separate sewer system summed up to 60% of the total load.

In addition to raising ecotoxicological concerns, the use of glyphosate adds phosphorus (P) to agricultural landscapes, influencing the accumulation and cycling of P in soil and nearby surface waters. Yet pesticides have been largely ignored when monitoring anthropogenic sources of P in agricultural watersheds. Estimating the supply of P derived from glyphosate use, both globally and in the US alone, we show that trends have markedly increased over the past two decades. Across the US, mean inputs of glyphosate-derived P increased from 1.6 kg P km(-2) in 1993 to 9.4 kg P km(-2) in 2014, with values frequently exceeding 20 kg P km(-2) in areas planted with glyphosate-resistant crops. Although still a minor source of P relative to fertilizers, P inputs from glyphosate use have now reached levels comparable to those from sources for which P regulations were initiated in the past.

"Hedberg, D; Wallin, M","Effects of Roundup and glyphosate formulations on intracellular transport, microtubules and actin filaments in Xenopus laevis melanophores",TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO,"Glyphosate containing herbicides, such as Roundup, are commonly used and generally considered to be safe. However, some toxic effects are found on amphibians in vivo and human and mouse cells in vitro. In this study the effects of Roundup, glyphosate, glyphosateisopropylamine and isopropylamine were studied on intracellular transport by measuring aggregation capacity in Xenopus laevis melanophores. The chemicals inhibited retrograde transport of melanosomes in the range of 0.5-5 mM. Cellular morphology and localization of microtubules and actin filaments were affected as determined by immunocytochemistry. Both glyphosate and Roundup decreased pH in the media. Acidic pH inhibited melanosome transport and altered microtubule and actin morphology in the absence of chemicals, while transport inhibiting concentrations of glyphosate, Roundup and glyphosateisopropylamine disassembled both microtubules and actin filaments. At physiological pH the effects of Roundup decreased whereas glyphosate failed to inhibit transport. Physiological pH decreases glyphosate lipophilicity and its diffusion into the cytoplasm. The Roundup formulation contains surfactants, such as POEA (polyetylated tallow amine) that increases membrane permeability allowing cellular uptake at physiological pH. Our results show that the effects of glyphosate containing compounds are pH-dependent and that they inhibit intracellular transport through disassembly of the cytoskeleton possibly by interfering with intracellular Ca2+-balance.

However, its use is highly controversial for the possible impact on not-target organisms, such as amphibians, which are vanishing at an alarming and rapid rate. Due to the high solubility in water and ionic nature, the glyphosate requires of surfactants to increase activity. I addition, for the control of coca (Erythroxylum coca) and agricultural weeds in Colombia, formulated glyphosate is mixed and sprayed with the adjuvant Cosmo-Flux (R) 411F to increase the penetration and activity of the herbicide. This study evaluates the acute toxic and sublethal effects (embryonic development, tadpole body size, tadpole swimming performance) of the mixture of the formulated glyphosate Roundup (R) Active and Cosmo-Flux (R) 411F to anuran embryos and tadpoles of four Colombian species under 96h laboratory standard tests and microcosms, which are more similar to field conditions as they include soil, sand and macrophytes. In the laboratory, embryos and tadpoles of Engystomops pustulosus were the most tolerant (LC50=3 904 mu g a.e./L; LC50=2 799 mu g a.e./L, respectively), while embryos and tadpoles of Hypsiboas crepitans (LC50=2 203 mu g a.e./L; LC50=1 424 mu g a.e./L, respectively) were the most sensitive. R. humboldti and R. marina presented an intermediate toxicity. Embryos were significantly more tolerant to the mixture than tadpoles, which could be likely attributed to the exclusion of chemicals by the embryonic membranes and the lack of organs, such as gills, which are sensitive to surfactants. Sublethal effects were observed for the tadpole body size, but not for the embryonic development and tadpole swimming performance. In microcosms, no toxicity (LC50 could not be estimated), or sublethal responses were observed at concentrations up to fourfold (14.76kg glyphosate a.e./ha) the highest field application rate of 3.69kg glyphosate a.e./ha. Thus, toxicity was less in the microcosms than in laboratory tests, which may be attributed to the presence of sediments and organic matter which rapidly adsorb glyphosate and surfactants such as POEA. It is concluded that the mixture of glyphosate (Roundup (R) Active) and Cosmo-Flux (R) 411F, as used in the field, has a negligible toxic effect to embryos and tadpoles of the species tested in this study.",2015,63,223,233,

Urbanization through wastewater treatment, industry through the release of inorganic and organic chemicals, and agriculture through the use of pesticides and herbicides are the main factors involved in water pollution. In France, more precisely in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, the poor quality of the watercourses is attributable overall to the use of glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural activities. Because these chemicals can impact individuals, populations, and biodiversity, we investigated, under experimental conditions, the physiological response of animals facing abiotic contaminants. We selected as a model, juveniles of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. We measured the gene expression and activity of the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes as well as the levels of lipid peroxidation, which are all oxidative stress biomarkers, in turtles challenged with high concentrations of glyphosate-based herbicides, on the one hand, and with degraded waters collected from a local watercourse, on the other. We also measured the acetylcholinesterase activity across the same animals. We showed through variations in gene expression and enzyme activity that a glyphosate commercial formulation induced a stress in turtles. A similar outcome was obtained when turtles faced degraded waters. The results indicated that the poor quality of regional waters could be a real threat for animal health. Because turtles are globally less sensitive to contaminants than amphibians, which are lacking in the degraded waters of the Pyrenees-Orientales department, they could constitute an excellent model to follow the evolution of water quality through the study of oxidative stress biomarkers.

The case of glyphosate and one toxigenic cyanobacterium on Chlorophycean microalgae,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Aquatic ecosystems face serious pollution issues. Discharges of toxic substances and eutrophication may lead to changes in the phytoplankton community and foster cyanobacterial blooms. Glyphosate-based herbicides are chemical stressors of microalgae that may affect the structure of phytoplankton communities, and also stimulate the synthesis of cyanotoxins by cyanobacteria. The simultaneous presence of glyphosate and toxigenic cyanobacteria increases the stress on microalgae, jointly affecting their growth and development. This study evaluated the combined effect of a toxigenic cyanobacterium and glyphosate in the development of an experimental microalgal community. We studied the effect of Microcystis aeruginosa on the population growth of the microalgae Ankistrodesmus fakatus, Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Scenedesmus incrassatulus. We also evaluated the combined effect of sub-inhibitory glyphosate (Faena (R)) concentrations on the content of macromolecules and the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as on the concentration ofTBARS. These effects were evaluated through the integrated biomarker response (IBR). In individual experiments, microalgae showed lower growth rates versus M. aeruginosa. In the mixed bioassays, both M. aeruginosa and microalgae showed reduced growth. IC50 values for Faena (R) ranged from 1.022 to 2.702 mg L-1. In the microalgae cyanobacteria bioassays, the herbicide lowered the growth rates of microalgae but stimulated the proliferation of M. aeruginosa. The joint action of both stressors affected growth rate and population dynamics, macromolecule content, and led to increased CAT and GPx levels. Faena (R) influenced growth rate and caused oxidative stress. On the other hand, the herbicide stimulated the synthesis of cyanotoxins, which further affected microalgal development. The experimental community was not only affected by the herbicide, but the mixed culture with cyanobacteria magnified the effects chemical stress.

Intensive agriculture contributes to the deterioration by providing indirectly fertilizers, pesticides, and other agrochemicals that affect the aquatic biota. Glyphosate is one of the most used herbicides worldwide, and microalgae are particularly sensitive to its formulation, inducing displacement of some green microalgae from the phytoplankton that leads to alterations in the floristic composition, which fosters the abundance of cyanobacteria, some of which can be toxigenic. The combination of chemical stressors such as glyphosate and biological ones, like cyanotoxins and other secondary metabolites of cyanobacteria, could induce a combined effect potentially more noxious to microalgae, affecting not only their growth but also their physiology and morphology. In this study, we evaluated the combined effect of glyphosate (Faena((R))) and a toxigenic cyanobacterium on the morphology and ultrastructure of microalgae in an experimental phytoplankton community. For this purpose, Microcystis aeruginosa (a cosmopolitan cyanobacterium that forms harmful blooms) and the microalgae Ankistrodesmus falcatus, Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Scenedesmus incrassatulus were cultivated, individually and jointly, exposing them to sub-inhibitory concentrations of glyphosate (IC10, IC20, and IC40). Effects were evaluated through scanning electron (SEM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy. Exposure to Faena((R)) produced alterations in the external morphology and ultrastructure of microalgae both individually and in combined cultures. SEM evidenced the loss of the typical shape and integrity of the cell wall and an increase in the biovolume. TEM revealed reduction and disorganization of the chloroplast, variation in starch and polyphosphate granules, formation of vesicles and vacuoles, cytoplasm degradation, and cell wall continuity loss. The presence of M. aeruginosa was, for microalgae, an additional stress factor adding to the chemical stress produced by Faena((R)), increasing the damage in their morphology and ultrastructure. These results alert to the effects that can be caused by glyphosate and the presence of toxigenic bacteria on the algal phytoplankton in contaminated and anthropic and eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.",2023,14,,,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1195776
"Hernández-Zamora, M; Rodríguez-Miguel, A; Martínez-Jerónimo, L; Martínez-Jerónimo, F",Combined Toxicity of Glyphosate (Faena®) and Copper to the American Cladoceran Daphnia exilis-A Two-Generation Analysis,WATER,"Glyphosate and copper are common pollutants in water and soil. Glyphosate is the most used herbicide worldwide; despite being claimed to be a low-toxicity pesticide and easily degraded, several studies have demonstrated glyphosate's occurrence and toxicity in freshwater ecosystems. Copper is an essential micronutrient; however, at high concentrations, it becomes toxic, and it is a persistent contaminant discharged from agricultural and industrial activities. Both glyphosate and Cu are agrochemicals that can occur in aquatic environments and produce stress in aquatic biota. Cladocerans are important zooplankters, and their sensitivity to chemical stressors has been widely documented. In this study, the North American cladoceran Daphnia exilis was exposed to glyphosate (Faena (R)) and Cu mixtures. The effects were assessed in two generations to determine toxicity impairment in the parental (P-1) and filial (F-1) generations. The 48 h median lethal concentration (LC50) of both chemicals was determined. After this, the generations P-1 and F-1 were exposed for 21 days to three concentrations of glyphosate and Cu mixtures (1.04 mg L-1 + 2.45 mu g , 1.24 mg L-1 + 3.09 mu g L-1, and 1.57 mg L-1 + 4.31 mu g L-1), starting from neonates. Survival and reproduction were recorded, and macromolecule content and the size of neonates were measured in the progeny. The LC50 was 4.22 mg L-1 for Faena (R) and 13.45 mu g L-1 for copper. Exposure to glyphosate and copper reduced fecundity and the number of clutches per female, delayed age at first reproduction, and increased the number of aborted eggs; these effects were more evident in the F-1 than in the P-1. In both generations, the concentration of carbohydrates and lipids was significantly reduced. The treatment and the brood number influenced the total length of neonates, but the total length did not differ significantly, whereas body length and body width decreased in F-1. Glyphosate and copper mixtures significantly increased toxicity in D. exilis in the F-1 generation, probably because the parents produced impaired progenies. Results warn about transgenerational effects in planktonic species chronically exposed to pollutants.",2023,15,,,10.3390/w15112018
"Herrmann, KM; Weaver, LM",The shikimate pathway,ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,"The shikimate pathway links metabolism of carbohydrates to biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. In a sequence of seven metabolic steps, phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate are converted to chorismate, the precursor of the aromatic amino acids and many aromatic secondary metabolites. All pathway intermediates can also be considered branch point compounds that may serve as substrates for other metabolic pathways. The shikimate pathway is found only in microorganisms and plants, never in animals. All enzymes of this pathway have been obtained in pure form from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources and their respective DNAs have been characterized from several organisms. The cDNAs of higher plants encode proteins with amino terminal signal sequences for plastid import, suggesting that plastids are the exclusive locale for chorismate biosynthesis. In microorganisms, the shikimate pathway is regulated by feedback inhibition and by repression of the first enzyme. In higher plants, no physiological feedback inhibitor has been identified, suggesting that pathway regulation may occur exclusively at the genetic level. This difference between microorganisms and plants is reflected in the unusually large variation in the primary structures of the respective first enzymes. Several of the pathway enzymes occur in isoenzymic forms whose expression varies with changing environmental conditions and, within the plant, from organ to organ. The penultimate enzyme of the pathway is the sole target for the herbicide glyphosate. Glyphosate-tolerant transgenic plants are at the core of novel weed control systems for several crop plants.",1999,50,473,503,10.1146/annurev.arplant.50.1.473

The toxic effects of glyphosate on Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, were assessed using immunotoxicity and genotoxicity biomarkers in this study. The results showed that 24 h and 96 h LC50 values of glyphosate for E. sinensis were estimated as 461.54 and 97.89 mg/L, respectively, and the safe concentration was 4.4 mg/L. According to the results above, glyphosate was applied at concentrations of 0, 4.4, 9.8, 44 and 98 mg/L, for 96 h in the exposure experiment. Total haemocyte count (THC) and percentage of granulocytes decreased significantly following 6 h exposure to each concentration of glyphosate and tended to gradually stabilize after 12 h except in 4.4 mg/L, which rapidly recovered to a normal level in 12 h. Phagocytic activity in all treatments decreased dramatically at 6 h and maintained stability until the 96-h mark. Comet tail has been observed early at 24 h in each treatment, and the comet ratio and percentage of DNA (% DNA) in the tail increased as the exposure experiment progressed. Immune-related enzyme activity varied during the experiment. Acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities in 44 and 98 mg/L treatments decreased significantly after 48 h exposure, while AKP activities in all concentrations increased markedly at the beginning of exposure. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities increased significantly after 6 h exposure to 44 and 98 mg/L of glyphosates but decreased at 24 h. In addition, the beta-glucuronidase (beta-GD) activities in the 9.8, 44 and 98 mg/L groups, increased after 6-h exposure and were significantly higher than those in the control at 96 h. These results indicated that glyphosate has evident toxic effect on E. sinensis by immune inhibition that is possibly due to the haemocyte DNA damage and a sharp decline in haemocyte numbers, which subsequently induced changes in activities of immune-related enzymes and haemocyte phagocytosis.

However, there are some uncertain aspects with respect to its environmental fate. To evaluate the existence and distribution of this pesticide and its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), their presence in fresh water, sediment, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) was measured in samples collected in a river running across a large city and through areas with intensive and extensive agriculture. The aquatic risk associated to the occurrence of these compounds was estimated using the hazard quotient (HQ) calculation for water and sediment. From the analyzed samples, overall 35% contained glyphosate, AMPA, or both compounds. Concentrations of the analytes were spread in different percentages depending on the environment almatrices considered, with levels ranging from 12 to 20 times higher for glyphosate and AMPA in sediment and SPM, as compared with the levels found in water. The most polluted area was situated within a green belt zone of the city; while in second place were sites located in areas of extensive agriculture. Aquatic organisms inhabiting areas both inside and outside agricultural areas are threatened by water glyphosate concentrations. Benthic organisms inside the greenbelt zone and inside the lower basin are threatened by the concentrations of glyphosate in sediment. Even when the concentrations measured in water were below the levels of concern for wildlife, results showed the risk of agricultural practices to aquatic biota.

While the potential for glyphosate to induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms has been demonstrated, the global molecular mechanisms of toxicity and potential effects in bacterial symbionts remain unclear, in particular for ecologically important marine species such as bivalve molluscs. Here, the effects of glyphosate (GLY), its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and a mixture of both (MIX) on the mussel M. galloprovincialis were assessed in a controlled experiment. For the first time, next generation sequencing (RNAseq and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) was used to evaluate such effects at the molecular level in both the host and its respective microbiota. The results suggest that the variable capacity of bacterial species to proliferate in the presence of these compounds and the impairment of host physiological homeostasis due to AMPA and GLY toxicity may cause significant perturbations to the digestive gland microbiota, as well as elicit the spread of potential opportunistic pathogens such as Vibrio spp.. The consequent host-immune system activation identified at the molecular and cellular level could be aimed at controlling changes occurring in the composition of symbiotic microbial communities. Overall, our data raise further concerns about the potential adverse effects of glyphosate and AMPA in marine species, suggesting that both the effects of direct toxicity and the ensuing changes occurring in the host-microbial community must be taken into consideration to determine the overall ecotoxicological hazard of these compounds.",2020,182,,,10.1016/j.envres.2019.108984

Non-target organisms are exposed to 2,4-D via several ways, which could produce toxic effects depending on the dose, frequency of exposure, and the host factors that influence susceptibility and sensitivity. An increasing number of experimental evidences have shown concerns about its presence/detection in the environment, because several investigations have pointed out its potential lethal effects on non-target organisms. In this review, we critically evaluated the environmental fate and behavior of 2,4-D along with its eco-toxicological effects on aquatic, plants and human life to provide concise assessment in the light of recently published reports. The findings demonstrate that 2,4-D is present in a low concentration in surface water of regions where its usage is high. The highest concentrations of 2,4-D were detected in soil, air and surface water surrounded by crop fields, which suggest that mitigation strategies must be implanted locally to prevent the entry of 2,4-D into the environment. A general public may have frequent exposure to 2,4-D due to its wide applications at home lawns and public parks, etc. Various in vivo and in vitro investigations suggest that several species (or their organs) at different trophic levels are extremely sensitive to the 2,4-D exposure, which may explain variation in outcomes of reported investigations. However, implications for the prenatal exposure to 2,4-D remain unknown because 2,4-D-induced toxicity thresholds in organism have only been derived from juveniles or adults. In near future, introduction of 2,4-D resistant crops will increase its use in agriculture, which may cause relatively high and potentially unsafe residue levels in the environment. The recent findings indicate the urgent need to further explore fate, accumulation and its continuous low level exposure impacts on the environment to generate reliable database which is key in drafting new regulation and policies to protect the population from further exposure.",2018,111,332,351,10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.020

When ROS are produced, hydrogen peroxide act as a signaling molecule that promote cell walls malleability allowing inward water transport causing cell expansion. .

We monitored community dynamics in glyphosate-impacted chemostats for 20 weeks to evaluate the potential impact of the herbicide on free-living and biofilm-associated bacterial community assemblages in a brackish ecosystem. A HPLC-MS/MS method was developed to measure glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid and sarcosine concentrations within a brackish matrix. These concentrations were analyzed weekly, together with prokaryotic succession, determined by total cell counts and next generation 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing. Shotgun metagenomics provided insights into the glyphosate degradation potential of the microbial communities. Temporal increases in total cell counts, bacterial diversity and the abundances of distinct bacterial operational taxonomic units were identified in the water column. Biofilm communities proved to be less affected than pelagic ones, but their responses were of longer duration. The increase of glyphosate oxidoreductase (gox) and thiO gene as well as the phn operon abundance indicated glyphosate degradation by first the aminomethylphosphonic acid pathway and possibly a subsequent cleavage of the C-P bond. However, although glyphosate concentrations were reduced by 99%, 1 mu M of the herbicide remained until the end of the experiment.

"Janssens, L; Stoks, R",Stronger effects of Roundup than its active ingredient glyphosate in damselfly larvae,AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY,"Pesticides are causing strong decreases in aquatic biodiversity at concentrations assumed safe by legislation. One reason for the failing risk assessment may be strong differences in the toxicity of the active ingredient of pesticides and their commercial formulations. Sublethal effects, especially those on behaviour, have been largely ignored in this context, yet can be equally important as lethal effects at the population and ecosystem levels. Here, we compared the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on survival, but also on ecologically relevant sublethal traits (life history, behaviour and physiology) in damselfly larvae. Roundup was more toxic than glyphosate with negative effects on survival, behaviour and most of the physiological traits being present at lower concentrations (food intake, escape swimming speed) or even only present (survival, sugar and total energy content and muscle mass) following Roundup exposure. This confirms the toxicity of the surfactant POEA. Notably, also glyphosate was not harmless: a realistic concentration of 2 mg/l resulted in reduced growth rate, escape swimming speed and fat content. Our results therefore indicate that the toxicity of Roundup cannot be fully attributed to its surfactant, thereby suggesting that also the new generation of glyphosate-based herbicides with other mixtures of surfactants likely will have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological studies comparing the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations typically ignore behaviour while the here observed differential effects on behaviour likely will negatively impact damselfly populations. Our data highlight that risk assessment of pesticides ignoring sublethal effects may contribute to the negative effects of pesticides on aquatic biodiversity.",2017,193,210,216,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.028

The evidence in support is: (1) That at a given epilimnion total phosphorus concentration (TP) the biomass of fish per m(2) is independent of depth, which means that biomass per m(3) is markedly higher in shallow lakes. (2) That the biomass of benthic invertebrates is higher in shallow lakes, which means that the benthi-planktivorous fish are less dependent on zooplankton prey than in deep lakes. By their ability to shift to zooplankton predation their density can remain high even in periods when zooplankton is scarce and they can thereby maintain a potentially high predation pressure on zooplankton. (3) That the possibilities of cladocerans to escape predation by vertical migration are less. (4) That the zooplankton:phytoplankton mass ratio per m(2) is lower and presumably then also the grazing pressure on phytoplankton. (5) That nutrient constraints appear to be weaker, as evidenced by the fact that at a given annual mean TP, summer TP is considerably higher in shallow lakes, especially in eutrophic lakes lacking submerged macrophytes. (6) That negative feedback on cladocerans by cyanobacteria is lower as cyanobacterial dominance is less frequent in shallow lakes and more easily broken (at least in Northern temperate lakes), and (7) That top-down control by benthi-planktivorous fish is markedly reduced in lakes rich in submerged macrophytes because the plants serve as a refuge for pelagic cladocerans and encourage predatory fish at the expense of prey fish. We conclude that manipulation of fish and submerged macrophytes may have substantial impact on lake ecosystems, in particular in shallow eutrophic lakes. On the contrary, if the conditions for more permanent changes in plant abundance or fish community structure are lacking the feed-back mechanisms that endeavour a return to the original turbid state will be particularly strong in shallow lakes.",1997,342,151,164,10.1023/A:1017046130329

However, the chronic toxicity mechanism of Gly on fish has not yet been clarified entirely. Thus, this study aimed to explore the potential toxicity mechanism of Gly at 2 mg/L, a possibly existing concentration in the aquatic environment, via biochemical, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the liver of tilapia. Long-term Gly exposure increased lipid content, and altered redox status in liver. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Gly exposure changed dramatically the expression of 225 genes in liver, including 94 up-regulated genes and 131 down-regulated genes. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses showed that these genes were predominantly enriched in ion transport, lipid metabolism and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, at proteomic level, long-term Gly exposure resulted in alteration of 21 proteins, which were principally related to hepatic metabolism function. In conclusion, our data displayed a potential toxicity, mainly manifested as redox imbalance and dysregulation of metabolism function, in the liver of tilapia after long-term Gly exposure at 2 mg/L.

The declared active component is taken alone for toxicity calculations, such as the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The PAHs with 2-3 cycles are more represented in pesticides than those with 4-6 cycles, which underlines that the petroleum residues appear to come mainly from crude unburned material.

Anthropogenic pollution and disease can cause both lethal and sub-lethal effects in aquatic species but our understanding of how these stressors interact is often not known. Contaminants can reduce host resistance to disease, but whether hosts are impacted at environmentally relevant concentrations is poorly understood. 2. We investigated the independent and combined effects of exposure to the common herbicide glyphosate and the trematode parasite Telogaster opisthorchis on survival and the development of spinal malformations in juvenile Galaxias anomalus, a New Zealand freshwater fish. We then investigated how exposure to a glyphosate concentration gradient (0 center dot 36, 3 center dot 6, 36 mg active ingredient (a.i.) L-1) affected the production and release of the infective cercarial stage of the parasite by its snail intermediate host Potamopyrgus antipodarum. 3. Survival of juvenile fish was unaffected by exposure to glyphosate alone (at an environmentally relevant concentration; 0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1) or by T. opisthorchis infection alone. However, simultaneous exposure to infection and glyphosate significantly reduced fish survival. 4. Juvenile fish developed spinal malformations when exposed either to infections alone or to infections and glyphosate, with a trend towards greater severity of spinal malformation after exposure to both stressors. 5. All snails exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (36 mg a.i. L-1) died within 24 h. Snails exposed to a moderate concentration (3 center dot 6 mg a.i. L-1) produced significantly more T. opisthorchis cercariae than snails in the control group or the low concentration group (0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1; the same concentration as in the fish experiment). 6. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show that parasites and glyphosate can act synergistically on aquatic vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, and that glyphosate might increase the risk of disease in fish. Our results have important implications when identifying risks to aquatic communities and suggest that threshold levels of glyphosate currently set by regulatory authorities do not adequately protect freshwater systems.",2010,47,498,504,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01791.x

Although glyphosate is more environmental favorable than many other herbicides, it may be exceptionally dangerous for aquatic ecosystems through high water solubility. Thus, the aim of the work was quantification of influence of Roundup Ultra 360 SL (containing isopropylamine salt of glyphosate as an active ingredient) on biomass and chlorophyll content within duckweed (Lemna minor L.). Moreover, changes in polyamine content and activity of such antioxidative enzymes as catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were assayed in order to determine the biochemical mechanisms of L minor response to the herbicide treatment. Obtained results showed that phytotoxicity of the herbicide was connected with decrease in chlorophyll-a, b and a+b content, and reduction of biomass growth. Roundup, similarly to some abiotic and biotic stressors, caused over-accumulation of putrescine, spermidine and total polyamines (PAs) within duckweed tissues. In addition an increase in CAT and APX activities suggested that stress generated by the herbicide treatment was at least partially connected with oxidative burst. Intensity of the duckweed responses to the herbicide was dependent on the applied herbicide level and/or duration of treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The risk of leaching was thus evaluated for glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) and its degradation product AMPA (amino-methylphosphonic acid) under field conditions at one sandy and two loamy sites. Over a 2-yr period, tile-drainage water, ground water, and soil water were sampled and analyzed for pesticides. At a sandy site, the strong soil sorption capacity and lack of macropores seemed to prevent leaching of both glyphosate and AMPA. At one loamy site, which received low precipitation with little intensity, the residence time within the root zone seemed sufficient to prevent leaching of glyphosate, probably due to degradation and sorption. Minor leaching of AMPA was observed at this site, although the concentration was generally low, being on the order of 0.05 mu g L-1 or less. At another loamy site, however, glyphosate and AMPA leached from the root zone into the tile drains (I m below ground surface [BGS]) in average concentrations exceeding 0.1 mu g L-1, which is the EU threshold value for drinking water. The leaching of glyphosate was mainly governed by pronounced macropore flow occurring within the first months after application. AMPA was frequently detected more than 1.5 yr after application, thus indicating a minor release and limited degradation capacity within the soil. Leaching has so far been confined to the depth of the tile drains, and the pesticides have rarely been detected in monitoring screens located at lower depths. This study suggests that as both glyphosate and AMPA can leach through structured soils, they thereby pose a potential risk to the aquatic environment.",2005,34,608,620,10.2134/jeq2005.0608

In practice, more than 2000 GLY-based herbicide (GBH) products are used, consisting of one or more active ingredients (AIs) and so-called inert co-formulants that increase the efficacy of the AIs. However, the focus of ecotoxicological assessments is mainly on AIs, while organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real-world conditions. Overall, the effects on non-target organisms indicate a broad range of biochemical and physiological modes of action, which contrasts with the general assumption that herbicides are specific and act only on target plants. Both GLY alone and GBHs have unintended side-effects on many terrestrial organisms, including non-target plants, microorganisms, insects, spiders, or earthworms, as well as vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, or mammals. One of the triggering mechanisms for these effects is oxidative stress with consequences on biochemical parameters and DNA damage. In addition, disruptions of various physiological, behavioral and ecological processes have been reported. Most studies have examined the short-term effects of a single application of GLY/GBH to a single species. However, the agricultural practice of applying GBHs two to three times during a cultivation season over an extended period of time, the interactions with other pesticides and agrochemicals applied to the same field, and effects on ecological interactions within the field and landscape are rarely considered. In the vast majority of cases, the toxicity of GBHs exceeds the toxicity of GLY, demonstrating that supposedly inert co-formulants are either toxic in their own right or interact and add to the toxicity of AIs. The chemical diversity of different GBHs and the non-disclosure of the co-formulants make it difficult to attribute effects to specific chemical substances within a GBH. Moreover, impurities in GBHs (e.g., heavy metals such as arsenic, chromium, cobalt) pose additional environment and food safety risks. These impacts are even more critical because GBHs are so widely distributed worldwide and interact with other pollutants and environmental stressors. Based on the available literature on terrestrial ecotoxicity, and given the drastic decline in biodiversity, we conclude that the continued high use of GBHs, resulting in increased exposure and risk, cannot be considered ecologically sustainable.",2023,35,,,10.1186/s12302-023-00758-9

Product approval is governed differently in these two sectors in the European Union (EU), and the occurrence of veterinary drug (VD) and pesticide residues indicated by contamination notification cases in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the EU also show characteristic differences. While the initial high numbers of VD residues reported in 2002 were successfully suppressed to less than 100 cases annually by 2006 and on, the number of notification cases for pesticide residues showed a gradual increase from a low (approximately 50 cases annually) initial level until 2005 to more than 250 cases annually after 2009, with a halt occurring only in 2016. Main notifiers of VD residues include Germany, Belgium, the UK, and Italy (63, 59, 42, and 31 notifications announced, respectively), and main consigning countries of non-compliances are Vietnam, India, China, and Brazil (88, 50, 34, and 23 notifications, respectively). Thus, countries of South and Southeast Asia are considered a vulnerable point with regard to VD residues entering the EU market. Unintended side effects of VDs and plant protection products may be caused not only by the active ingredients but also by various additives in these preparations. Adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) and other co-formulants used in therapeutic agents and feed additives, as well as in pesticide formulations have long been considered as inactive ingredients in the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pharmaceutical or pesticide, and in turn, legal regulations of the approval and marketing of these additives specified significantly less stringent risk assessment requirements, than those specified for the active ingredients. However, numerous studies have shown additive, synergistic, or antagonistic side effects between the active ingredients and their additives in formulated products; moreover, toxicity has been evidenced for various additives. Therefore, toxicological evaluation of surfactants and other additives is essential for proper environmental risk assessment of formulations used in agriculture including animal husbandry and plant protection.",2017,4,,,10.3389/fvets.2017.00146

To assess combined effects, glyphosate was applied in its pure form (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and in preparation Roundup Classic (R) formulated with polyethoxylated tallowamines (POEA). Standing and running surface water samples originated from Lake Balaton and River Danube between early May and mid-June of 2015. The kinetics of dissipation of glyphosate, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with UV-VIS absorbance detection or tandem mass spectrometry, was investigated under laboratory conditions in aquaria with or without the presence of biofilms. The quantity and the biofilm structure of algal biomass were determined by in vivo fluorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The presence of POEA affected the dissipation of glyphosate, and dissipation profiles differed in the investigated natural waters. Significantly higher initial concentrations of glyphosate were measured in River Danube for treatment with formulated glyphosate (101.4 +/- 6.2 mu g L-1), than with glyphosate alone (79.9 +/- 6.6 mu g L-1), and dissipation to a residual level (57.6 +/- 1.4 mu g L-1) consequently took longer (approximately by 1day). Degradation of glyphosate from the initial level (91.24 +/- 5.9 mu g L-1) in Lake Balaton was not detected. Phytotoxic effects of glyphosate, particularly if enhanced by a formulant on algal biomass, were observed. Thus, 5-18% and 11-33% of algal biomass reduction was determined in River Danube upon treatments with glyphosate and Roundup Classic (R), respectively. Corresponding biomass decreases in Lake Balaton were 1.3-13% and 9-14%, respectively, accompanied by an overall decay in the algal biofilms. In River Danube, treatments resulted in the occurrence of 1.4-5.8% of green algae in the algal biomass in 28days, while green algae were not detected in the untreated control. The results indicate that glyphosate is capable of modifying the structure of the algal community and to induce increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances matrix in the biofilms assessed.",2017,97,901,921,10.1080/03067319.2017.1373770

In this study, measurements in blood samples such as levels of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), carboxylesterase (CbE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), modified alkaline comet assay (ACA) for detection of oxidized bases (FPG and Endo III sites), as well as the ratio of heterophils and lymphocytes (H/L), were evaluated as non-destructive biomarkers to monitor dermal pesticide exposure in male toads of Rhinella arenarum. Toads were exposed to a solution containing a nominal concentration of commercial formulations of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF, 10 mg/L), and herbicides 2,4-D and glyphosate (GLY) (20 mg/L, respectively). After 48 h of exposure, the levels of plasma B-sterases (BChE and CbE) were inhibited (55 and 43 %, respectively) in toads exposed to CPF. Also, the activity of GST was inducted for dermal exposure to 2,4-D, as well as the levels of TBARS due to CPF exposure. Besides this, CPF and 2,4-D exposure induced oxidative DNA damage, and the H/L ratio decreased for the both herbicide exposures. Our results showed that exposure via dermal uptake to CPF, 2,4-D, and GLY in the common toad R. arenarum induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immunological depression.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to a commercial formulation of glyphosate, Roundup(R) Flex (RF), at environmentally relevant and higher concentrations in zebrafish larvae through the assessment of the inflammatory, oxidative stress and cell death response. Transgenic Tg(mpxGFP)i114 and wild-type (WT) zebrafish larvae (72 h post-fertilisation) were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 mu g mL(-1) of RF (based on the active ingredient concentration) for 4 h 30 min. A concentration of 2.5 mu g mL(-1) CuSO4 was used as a positive control. Copper sulphate exposure showed effectiveness in enhancing the inflammatory profile by increasing the number of neutrophils, nitric oxide (NO) levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death. None of the RF concentrations tested showed changes in the number of neutrophils and NO. However, the concentration of 10 mu g a.i. mL(-1) was able to induce an increase in ROS levels and cell death. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)), the biotransformation activity, the levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidised (GSSG) glutathione, lipid peroxidation (LPO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were similar among groups.

In this sense, a critical review was performed, synthesizing data from the peer-reviewed bibliography, reporting on the toxicity of exposure to pure GLY and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), using zebrafish as an animal model. The concentrations of this herbicide that induced toxic effects are highly variable, with some exceeding the limits determined by regulatory agencies. Globally, relevant toxic effects have been reported in zebrafish, namely, teratogenic effects incompatible with life, which translates directly into an increase in reported zebrafish mortality. Neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, changes in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, and immune and hormonal system dysfunction with an impact on fish reproduction were also described.

Water fleas are some of the key components in aquatic food webs, being one of the most sensitive groups to pollutants. Although being often used in standardized toxicity tests, they are comparatively less studied in relation to glyphosate exposition. Here we examine the current scientific literature regarding the acute and sublethal toxicity of glyphosate in the Cladocera taxonomic group, with special comparisons between the active ingredient (A.I) and formulations. Our results document a high variation in the lethal concentrations reported for different cladoceran species, due to the high diversity of products used in the toxicity tests. Most articles accounting for sublethal effects were performed on the standard Daphnia magna species.

This compound has a favorable environmental safety profile but was suspected to induce deleterious effects in aquatic organisms, with a potential effect of some associated co-formulants. This study aimed to assess the impact of direct and chronic exposure to glyphosate on the health status of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. A total of 36 genitors were exposed daily for 10 months to a dose of glyphosate representative of environmental concentrations (around 1 mu g L-1) using the AS alone or two GBHs formulations (i.e. Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Larding) and findings were compared to an unexposed control group (n = 12). The effects of chemical exposure on the reproductive capacities, hemato-immunologic functions, energetic metabolism, oxidative stress and specific biomarkers of exposure were analyzed over a period of 4 months covering spawning. A limited mortality between 15% and 30% specific to the spawning occurred under all conditions. No differences were observed in reproduction parameters i.e. mean weights, relative fertility and fecundity. Red blood cell count, hematocrit index, mean corpuscular volume and white blood cell counts were similar for all the sampling dates. Significant changes were observed two months before spawning with a 70% decrease of the proportion of macrophages in trout exposed to Viaglif only and a reduction of 35% of the phagocytic activity in fish exposed to the two GBHs. Trends towards lower levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (between 38% and 66%) were detected one month after the spawning for all contaminated conditions but without being statistically significant. Biomarkers of exposure, i.e. acetylcholine esterase and carbonic anhydrase activities, were not impacted and none of the chemical contaminants disturbed the oxidative stress or metabolism parameters measured. These results suggest that a 10 months exposure of rainbow trout to a concentration of 1 mu g L-1 of glyphosate administered using the pure active substance or two GBHs did not significantly modify their global health including during the spawning period. The immunological disturbances observed will need to be further explored because they could have a major impact in response to infectious stress.",2021,230,,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105687

Low frequency sampling may therefore largely underestimate maximum pesticide concentrations and fluxes. Detailed storm-based sampling of pesticide concentrations in runoff water to better predict pesticide sources, transport pathways and toxicity within the headwater catchments is lacking. High frequency monitoring (2 min) of seven pesticides (Dimetomorph, Fluopicolide, Glyphosate, Iprovalicarb, Tebuconazole, Tetraconazole and Triadimenol) and one degradation product (AMPA) were assessed for 20 runoff events from 2009 to 2012 at the outlet of a vineyard catchment in the Layon catchment in France. The maximum pesticide concentrations were 387 mu g L-1. Samples from all of the runoff events exceeded the legal limit, of 0.1 mu g L-1 for at least one pesticide (European directive 2013/39/EC). High resolution sampling used to detect the peak pesticide levels revealed that Toxic Units (TU) for algae, invertebrates and fish often exceeded the European Uniform principles (25%). The point and average (time or discharge-weighted) concentrations indicated up to a 30- or 4-fold underestitnation of the TU obtained when measuring the maximum concentrations, respectively. This highlights the important role of sampling methods for assessing peak exposure. High resolution sampling combined with concentration-discharge hysteresis analyses revealed that clockwise responses were predominant (52%), indicating that Hortonian runoff is the prevailing surface runoff trigger mechanism in the study catchment. The hysteresis patterns for suspended solids and pesticides were highly dynamic and storm- and chemical-dependent Intense rainfall events induced stronger C-Qhysteresis (magnitude). This study provides new insights into the complexity of pesticide dynamics in runoff water and highlights the ability of hysteresis analysis to improve understanding of pesticide supply and transport.

"Meza-Joya, FL; Ramírez-Pinilla, MP; -Lorenzo, JLF","Toxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects of a glyphosate formulation (Roundup®SL-Cosmoflux®411F) in the direct-developing frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei",ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS,"The aerial spraying of glyphosate formulations in Colombia to eradicate illegal crops has generated great concern about its possible impact on nontarget organisms, particularly amphibians. This study evaluated the toxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects of a glyphosate formulation (Roundup (R) SL-Cosmoflux (R) 411F) in the direct-developing frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei by estimating the median lethal application rate (LC50), median hemolytic application rate (HD50), and extent of DNA damage using the in vitro and in vivo Comet assays. Toxicity results indicated that the application rate [37.4 mu g acid equivalent (a.e.)/cm2] equivalent to that used in aerial spraying (3.74 kg a.e./ha) is not lethal in male and female adult frogs, whereas neonates are highly sensitive. Glyphosate formulation at application rates above 5.4 mu g a.e./cm2 (in vivo) and concentrations above 95 mu g a.e./mL (in vitro) showed clear evidence of cytotoxicity. In vivo and in vitro exposure of E. johnstonei erythrocytes to the glyphosate formulation induced DNA breaks in a dose-dependent manner with statistically significant values (P<0.05) at all doses tested. DNA damage initially increased with the duration of exposure and then decreased, suggesting that DNA repair events were occurring during in vivo and in vitro exposures. These results are discussed from the perspective of possible ecotoxicological risks to anuran species from exposure to glyphosate formulation. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 54:362-373, 2013.

Among those, glyphosate-based herbicides are toxic and affect target organs such as the liver. Evaluations of livers of female Poecilia reticulata by exposures to IONPs at a concentration of 0.3 mg/L were performed with association to: (1) 0.65 mg of glyphosate per litter and (2) 1.3 mg of glyphosate per litter of Roundup Original, and (3) glyphosate P.A at 0.65 mg/L. These associations were carried out progressively, after 7, 14, and 21 days. We detected circulatory disturbances, inflammatory responses, activation of the immune system, regressive changes, and progressive responses with changes in the connective tissue and decreased glycogen reserve from days 14 to 21. Ultrastructural changes in the Disse space and microvilli of hepatocytes indicated decreased contact surface area. In general, the damage was time and concentration dependent, increasing from 7 to 14 days and tending to stabilize from 14 to 21 days. Therefore, herbicide-associated IONPs functioned as xenobiotics inducing intense cellular detoxification processes and activation of hepatic immune responses.",2022,37,2244,2258,10.1002/tox.23591

"Levis, NA; Johnson, JR",Level of UV-B radiation influences the effects of glyphosate-based herbicide on the spotted salamander,ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are the number one pesticide in the United States and are used commonly around the world. Understanding the affects of glyphosate-based herbicides on non-target wildlife, for example amphibians, is critical for evaluation of regulations pertaining to the use of such herbicides. Additionally, it is important to understand how variation in biotic and abiotic environmental conditions, such as UV-B light regime, could potentially affect how glyphosate-based herbicides interact with non-target species. This study used artificial pond mesocosms to identify the effects of generic glyphosate-based herbicide (GLY-4 Plus) on mortality, cellular immune response, body size, and morphological plasticity of larvae of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) under conditions that reflect moderate (UVM) and low (UVL) UV-B light regimes. Survival within a given UV-B level was unaffected by herbicide presence or absence. However, when herbicide was present, survival varied between UV-B levels with higher survival in UVM conditions. Herbicide presence in the UVM treatments also decreased body size and reduced cellular immune response. In the UVL treatments, the presence of herbicide increased body size and affected tail morphology. Finally, in the absence of herbicide, body size and cellular immune response were higher in UVM treatments compared to UVL treatments. Thus, the effects of herbicide on salamander fitness were dependent on UV-B level. As anthropogenic habitat modifications continue to alter landscapes that contain amphibian breeding ponds, salamanders may increasingly find themselves in locations with reduced canopy cover and increased levels of UV light. Our findings suggest that the probability of surviving exposure to the glyphosate-based herbicide used in this study may be elevated in more open canopy ponds, but the effects on other components of fitness may be varied and unexpected.",2015,24,1073,1086,10.1007/s10646-015-1448-2

Autotrophs were cultured 21 days in their appropriate standard media supplemented with various amounts of Roundup (R), glyphosate, GIPA and IPA. The determination of the growth of examined photoautotrophs was performed by time-course measurements of total chlorophyll content in experimental cultures. The growth rates related to corresponding concentrations of chemicals, the EC50 values and generation doubling time were determined in order to present the toxicity Roundup (R) 360 SL formulation and its main constituents. Market available formulation of Roundup (R) was found to possess toxicity significantly higher than this, attributed to its main constituents; however both these compounds, isopropylamine and glyphosate, also inhibited the growth of examined strains in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the interpretation of toxicity of the examined substances was found to be significantly dependent on the method of EC50 calculation. The choice of molar or weight concentration of substances tested separately and in specific formulation was found to be essential in this matter. Due to these findings the EC50 values were calculated based either on molar or on weight concentrations. Considering Roundup (R) 360 SL formulation, these values ranged from 10(-3) up to 10(-1) mM and they were one order of magnitude lower than those found for isopropylamine. Quite surprisingly the minimum EC50 values found for glyphosate did not reach micromolar concentrations, whereas most of the EC50 values revealed to IPA did not exceed this range. Notably, in all the cases except for Synechocystis aquatilis Sauvageau, isopropylamine alone was indicated as more toxic than glyphosate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

All,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The coexistence of glyphosate and copper is widely found in bodies of water and terrestrial ecosystems due to widespread application of herbicides and heavy metal. However, their joint ecotoxicological risks in aquatic environments remain unknown. The experiment investigated the individual and combined effects of glyphosate and copper on the growth and physiological response in Salvinia natans (L.) All. The results showed that their joint toxicity is related to concentration. Antagonistic effects were induced when plants were exposed to low concentrations of glyphosate and copper (<= 1 + 0.2 mg l(-1)). Synergistic effects were elicited at higher doses (>= 5 + 1 mg l(-1)). In addition, increased hydrogen peroxide levels indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress at individual or combined exposures. To cope with oxidative stress, S. natans can activate the antioxidant defense systems, including increased superoxide dismutase and changes in peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. High concentrations of combined pollution exceed the oxidative defense capabilities of plants, and therefore, malondialdehyde content increased significantly.

In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed for 120 hpf to 0.7, 7, and 35 mg L-1 GLY. The results show that GLY treatment induced developmental toxicity in the fish, including premature hatching, reduced heartbeats, pericardial and yolk sac oedema, swim bladder deficiency, and shortened body length, which was possibly due to a significantly decreased triiodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4) ratio and the abnormal expression patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) (crh, tsh beta, tr alpha, tr beta, and t tr ) and growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis-related genes (gh, ghr alpha, ghr beta, igf1, igf1r alpha, and igf1r beta) in larvae exposed to GLY. In addition, GLY exposure altered the levels of SOD and CAT, increased ROS, promoted malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and significantly altered the levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling pathway factors (perk, eif2 alpha, gadd34, atf4, ire1 alpha, xbp1, atf6, hspa5, and chop), suggesting that GLY treatment induced oxidative injury and ER stress in the larvae. Further research showed that treatment with a higher concentration of GLY upregulated the levels of iNOS, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha while inhibiting the expression of IL-10 and TGF-beta, suggesting that GLY causes an inflammatory reaction in the larvae. In addition, we also found that apoptosis was induced in the larvae, which was determined by acridine orange staining and abnormal expression of p53, caspase-3,-8, and-9. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GLY exposure altered the T3/T4 ratio, disturbed the expression patterns of HPT and GH/IGF axis-related genes, and induced oxidative and ER stress, inflammatory reactions, and apoptosis in the zebrafish larvae.

The hepatic histopathological observations revealed several types of lesions in the tadpoles exposed to both GLY and POEA. Overall, then, the results of the study indicate that both GLY and POEA have potential genotoxic, mutagenic, and hepatotoxic effects in D. minutus tadpoles.

The intensive use of these products combined with the lack of treatment of agricultural wastewater is causing contamination of the natural environments, especially the aquatics. Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is the most commonly used herbicide in agriculture worldwide. Studies have shown that this compound is toxic to a variety of fish species at the concentrations of environmental relevance. Glyphosate-based herbicides can affect fish biochemical, physiological, endocrine, and behavioral pathways. Changes in behaviors such as foraging, escaping from predators, and courtship can compromise the survival of species and even communities. The behavior patterns of fish has been shown to be a sensitive tool for risk assessment. In this sense, this review summarizes and discusses the toxic effects of glyphosate and its formulations on the behavior of fish in different life stages. Additionally, behavioral im-pairments were associated with other negative effects of glyphosate such as energy imbalance, stress responses, AChE inhibition, and physiological and endocrine disturbances, which are evidenced and described in the literature.

In this study, the effect of glyphosate on sperm quality of the fish Danio rerio was investigated after 24 and 96 h of exposure at concentrations of 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L. The spermatic cell concentration, sperm motility and motility period were measured employing conventional microscopy. The mitochondrial functionality, membrane integrity and DNA integrity were measured by fluorescence microscopy using specific probes. No significant differences in sperm concentration were observed; however, sperm motility and the motility period were reduced after exposure to both glyphosate concentrations during both exposure periods. The mitochondrial functionality and membrane and DNA integrity were also reduced at the highest concentration during both exposure periods. The results showed that glyphosate can induce harmful effects on reproductive parameters in D. rerio and that this change would reduce the fertility rate of these animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We carried out two experiments using microcosms under laboratory conditions for 7 days each. In the first experiment, we analyzed changes in species composition, abundance and chlorophyll a of phytoplankton due to 10 treatments: control; low, medium and high concentrations of G and 2,4-D; and mixtures at low, medium and high concentrations at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45. In the second experiment we studied changes on the composition of the autotrophic fraction and abundance, chlorophyll a, dry weight (DW), ash free dry weight (AFDW) and autotrophic index of periphyton developed in artificial substrata under 7 treatments considering the lowest doses that showed an effect in the previous phytoplankton experiment: control; pure G and Glifosato Atanor (R) (glyphosate-based formulation); pure 2,4-D and Asi Max 50 (R) (2,4-D based formulation); mixtures of the a.i at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45, and mixture of Glifosato Atanor(.)(R) + Asi Max (R). Results showed that G was more toxic than 2,4-D to the algal fraction, decreasing chlorophyll a, turbidity and algal abundances in the phytoplankton experiment. The effects of the mixture on phytoplankton were mainly additive, except for total and Staurastrum sp. live abundances where an antagonistic effect between herbicides was recorded. Periphyton showed more resistance to the herbicides as it was less affected than phytoplankton by the active ingredients and commercial formulations.

At the same time, zebrafish embryos exposed to glyphosate exhibited car-diac malformations, including enlarged chambers, thinned ventricular walls, and rhythm disturbances. In addition, de-fective intersegmental vasculature occurred after glyphosate exposure, indicating impaired angiogenesis. Mechanistically, apoptosis clustered in the heart and vascular regions and levels of ATP and apoptosis-related genes including caspase-3, caspase-9, bax, and bcl-2 were altered.

The eco-safety of glyphosate is still in controversy, and it is inconclusive how glyphosate influences aquatic microbial communities. In the present study, the effects of glyphosate on the structure and function of microbial communities in a freshwater microcosm were investigated. 165/185 rRNA gene sequencing results showed that glyphosate treatment (2.5 mg L-1, 15 days) did not significantly alter the physical and chemical condition of the microcosm or the composition of the main species in the community, but metatranscriptomic analyses indicated that the transcriptions of some cyanobacteria were significantly influenced by glyphosate. The microbial community enhanced the gene expression in pathways related to translation, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism to potentially withstand glyphosate contamination. In the low phosphorus (P) environment, a common cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, plays a special role by utilizing glyphosate as P source and thus reducing its toxicity to other microbes, such as Pseudanabaena. In general, addition of glyphosate in our artificial microcosms did not strongly affect the aquatic microbial community composition but did alter the community's transcription levels, which might be potentially explained by that some microbes could alleviate glyphosate's toxicity by utilizing glyphosate as a P source.

Cordoba, Argentina",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The study area is located in the eastern slope of Las Penas Mountain and its adjacent oriental fluvioaeolian-plain. Agriculture is the main activity (soybean, maize, wheat, peanuts and alfalfa) with notillage farming and intensive use of agrochemicals (pesticides-fertilizers). Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine) is the most common used herbicide which suffers microbial biodegradation giving aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), its main metabolite. The objective of this work is to evaluate hydrogeological features which influence the presence of glyphosate and AMPA in waters. In the study area, the main flow direction of surface and groundwater is NW-SE. The unsaturated zone thickness decreases in the same direction from 60 to 0 m, so groundwater surges in low areas in the eastern sector. From the total water samples collected, glyphosate was detected in 66% of surface water samples (0.2 to 167.4 mu g/L), in 15.8% of the groundwater samples (1.3 to 2 mu g/L) and in the harvested precipitation sample (0.2 mu g/L). AMPA was found in 33% of surface water and 15.8% of groundwater. The herbicide detection was related to areas with the shallowest water table (< 4 m), low hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer (K = 1.5 m/d), low hydraulic gradient (i = 0.16%) and very low flow velocity (0.02 m/d). The most outstanding result is that the groundwater presents higher values in comparison with the surface water samples, which can be explained by the greater dilution capacity of streams. The detection of glyphosate and AMPA in the unconfined aquifer shows that the application for decades under the prevailing agricultural model exceeds the degradation potential of the soil and the unsaturated zone, causing groundwater contamination.

All of the surfactants biodegraded extensively in aerobic screening tests and may be assumed to approach 100% removal in aerobic wastewater treatment plants, except in cases of high loadings or otherwise exceptional conditions. Anaerobic biodegradability tests showed that an ethyl glycoside monoester (EGE) and a linear alkyl polyglycoside (APG) were both mineralized (>70%) under methanogenic conditions. In contrast, a branched APG resisted anaerobic degradation, while the alcohol ethoxylate was partially mineralized by anaerobic bacteria. The EGE surfactant was most rapidly mineralized in aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability tests. None of the surfactants inhibited respiration in activated sludge at the highest concentration tested (200 mg/L). Tests with aquatic organisms showed increasing toxicity in the following order: branched APG < EGE < linear APG < alcohol ethoxylate. Negligible aquatic toxicity was observed for the branched APG, while the alcohol ethoxylate was highly toxic to examined organisms. This evaluation demonstrates that considerable variation in biodegradability and toxicity responses can be seen within structurally related glucose-based surfactants.",1996,73,929,933,10.1007/BF02517997

Geographically gridded data of agricultural pesticides are crucial to assess human and ecosystem exposure to potential and recognised toxicants. However, pesticides inventories are often sparse over time and by region, mostly report aggregated classes of active ingredients, and are generally fragmented across local or government authorities, thus hampering an integrated global analysis of pesticide risk. Here, we introduce PEST-CHEMGRIDS, a comprehensive database of the 20 most used pesticide active ingredients on 6 dominant crops and 4 aggregated crop classes at 5 arc-min resolution (about 10 km at the equator) projected from 2015 to 2025. To estimate the global application rates of specific active ingredients we use spatial statistical methods to re-analyse the USGS/PNSP and FAOSTAT pesticide databases along with other public inventories including global gridded data of soil physical properties, hydroclimatic variables, agricultural quantities, and socio-economic indices. PEST-CHEMGRIDS can be used in global environmental modelling, assessment of agrichemical contamination, and risk analysis.",2019,6,,,10.1038/s41597-019-0169-4

Although there is abundant spatial and temporal information on atrazine occurrence at regional scales, there are far fewer data for glyphosate, and studies that compare the two herbicides are rare. We investigated temporal patterns in glyphosate and atrazine concentrations measured weekly during the 2013 growing season in 100 small streams inthe Midwestern United States. Glyphosate was detected in 44% of samples (method reporting level 0.2 mu g/L); atrazine was detected above a threshold of 0.2 mu g/L in 54% of samples. Glyphosate was detected more frequently in 12 urban streams than in 88 agricultural streams, and at concentrations similar to those in streams with high agricultural land use (>40% row crop) in the watershed. In contrast, atrazine was detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in agricultural streams than in urban streams. The maximum concentration of glyphosate measured at most urban sites exceeded the maximum atrazine concentration, whereas at agricultural sites the reverse was true. Measurement at a 2-day interval at 8 sites in northern Missouri revealed that transport of both herbicide compounds appeared to be controlled by spring flush, that peak concentration duration was brief, but that peaks in atrazine concentrations were of longer duration than those of glyphosate. The 2-day sampling also indicated that weekly sampling is unlikely to capture peak concentrations of glyphosate and atrazine.

However, because of its overuse and resistance to degradation, high levels of glyphosate residues in the environment are reported. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of glyphosate on proteomic aspects of Tetrahymena thermophila and their uses as bioindicators of freshwater ecosystem. First, an acute toxicity test was performed to determine the median inhibition concentration (IC50). The toxicity test results showed that glyphosate inhibited the growth (proliferation) of T. thermophila. The 96 h-IC50 value of glyphosate was 171 mg L-1. No visible changes in aggregation behavior and cell morphology were observed under glyphosate exposure. In addition, the effects of low and high dose glyphosate concentrations (77.5 mg L-1, 171 mg L-1) on the proteomic changes of T. thermophila was investigated using a label-free shotgun proteomic approach. A total of 3191 proteins were identified, 2791 proteins were expressed in the control, 2651 proteins were expressed in 77.5 mg L-1 glyphosates, and 3012 proteins were expressed in 171 mg L-1 glyphosates. Under glyphosate exposure at both low and high dose glyphosate, 400 unique proteins were upregulated. The majority of these proteins was classified as proteins associated with oxidative stress response and intracellular transport indicating the shifts in the internal metabolism. Proteomics revealed that the glyphosate metabolism by T. thermophila is a multi-step process involving several enzymes, which can be divided into four phases, including modification (phase I), conjugation (phase II), transport (phase III), and degradation (phase IV). The accumulation of various biochemical reactions contributes to overall glyphosate resistance. With the proteomics approach, we have found that T. thermophila was equipped with glyphosate detoxification and degradation mechanisms.",2023,38,867,882,10.1002/tox.23735

Three treatments were exposed to different concentrations of pure GLY (100, 1000, and 10,000 mu g g(-1), respectively), and there was also a control group. After the experimental time, liver and blood were analyzed. Melanomacrophages (MMCs) were located between the hepatocyte cordons, close to sinusoids. GLY increased the melanin area in MMCs of Leptodactylus latinasus exposed since lowest concentration until highest concentration. GLY also changed the occurrence of hepatic catabolism pigments into melanomacrophages and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities; therefore, it can interfere with the hepatic metabolism. In conclusion, GLY promotes alterations in the hepatic tissue and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities. Furthermore, MMCs may be useful as morphological responses of GLY effects.",2016,23,9852,9861,10.1007/s11356-016-6153-z

Many of the recent studies focus solely on the persistence of pesticides in soils, air, water or food products, or even on the degree of exposure of animals, since their potential hazards to human health have raised concerns. Given the unaware exposure of the general population to pesticides, and the absence of a significant number of studies on occupational hazards, new glyphosate-induced toxicity data obtained for both residual and acute doses should be analyzed and systematized. Additionally, recent studies also highlight the persistence and toxicity of both glyphosate metabolites and surfactants present in herbicide formulations. To renew or ban the use of glyphosate, recently published studies must be taken into account, aiming to define new levels of safety for exposure to herbicide, its metabolites, and the toxic excipients of its formulations. This review aims to provide an overview of recent publications (2010-present) on in vitro and in vivo studies aimed at verifying the animal toxicity induced by glyphosate, its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and glyphosate-based formulations, evaluated in various experimental models.

Considering that information concerning the impact of GLY on bivalves is scarce, in this study we evaluated for the first time the effects of environmentally realistic concentrations of GLY (10, 100 and 1000 a) to the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were exposed for 7, 14 and 21 days and several biomarkers were measured in haemocytes/haemolymph (total haemocyte counts, haemocyte diameter and volume, haemolymph pH, haemolymph lactate dehydrogenase activity, haemocyte lysate lysozyme and acid phosphatase activities), as well as in gills and digestive gland (antioxidant enzyme and acetylcholinesterase activities). The concentrations of GLY and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid in the experimental tanks were also measured. The MANOVA analysis demonstrated that the experimental variables considered (exposure concentration, exposure duration, and their interaction) affected significantly biomarker responses. In addition, the two-way ANOVA analysis indicated that GLY was able to affect most of the cellular parameters measured, whereas antioxidant enzyme activities resulted to be influenced moderately. Interestingly, exposure to GLY reduced significantly acetylcholinesterase activity in gills. Although preliminary, the results of this study demonstrated that GLY can affect both cellular and biochemical parameters in mussels, highlighting a potential risk for aquatic invertebrates.

"McCarthy, SDS; Rafferty, SP; Frost, PC",Responses of alkaline phosphatase activity to phosphorus stress in Daphnia magna,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"We examined how alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity within the bodies and in the materials released by the crustacean Daphnia magna responds to variable algal food phosphorus (P)-content. We found that Daphnia eating P-poor food (C:P similar to 700) had significantly higher AP activity in their bodies on a mass-specific basis compared with individuals eating P-rich food (C:P similar to 100). This dietary P effect on AP activity was not altered by Daphnia starvation but was partially related to differences in the P concentration of animal body homogenates. By contrast, poor P-nutrition of Daphnia lowered AP activity in released materials compared with that measured from their P-sufficient conspecifics. Moreover, AP activity in Daphnia release was lowest in animals consuming P-poor food for longer time periods. Our results support the hypothesis that AP activity increases inside P-limited Daphnia as a mechanism to increase P-acquisition and retention from ingested algae in these nutritionally stressed animals. The lower level of AP activity present in the water of P-deprived animals could reflect a change from largely free to membrane-bound AP isotypes in the digestive tracts of P-starved animals or a decrease in the shedding of membrane-anchored AP from their intestinal lining. These results supplement accumulating evidence that P-poor algal food reduces the dietary mineral P available to Daphnia. In addition, animal body AP activity measurements, with some refinement, may prove useful as an in situ indicator of P-stress in aquatic consumers.",2010,213,256,261,10.1242/jeb.037788

"Mensah, PK; Muller, WJ; Palmer, CG",Acute toxicity of Roundup® herbicide to three life stages of the freshwater shrimp Caridina nilotica (Decapoda: Atyidae),PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH,"Glyphosate based herbicides, including Roundup (R), are frequently used in the chemical control of weeds and invading alien plant species in South Africa. These herbicides ultimately get into water courses directly or indirectly through processes such as drifting, leaching, surface runoff and foliar spray of aquatic nuisance plants. Despite their widespread use, no water quality guideline exists to protect indigenous South African freshwater organisms from the toxic effects of these herbicides. The toxicity of the herbicide Roundup (R) was assessed using three different life stages of the freshwater shrimp Caridina nilotica, a prevalent species in South African freshwater ecosystems. Neonate (<7 days post hatching (dph)), juvenile (>7 dph and <20 dph) and adult (>40 dph) shrimps were exposed to varying concentrations (1.5-50 mg/L acid equivalence (a.e.)) of the herbicide in 48 and 96 h acute toxicity tests in order to determine the most sensitive life-stage. The results showed neonates to be more sensitive to Roundup than both juveniles and adults with mean 96 h LC(50) values of 2.5, 7.0 and 25.3 mg/L a.e. respectively. The estimated 96 h LC(50) of neonates is much lower than the application rate (20-30 mg/L a.e.), although the application's impact will depend on the dilution rate of the applied concentration in the environment. All three life-stages of unexposed animals exhibited active and coordinated movement but exposed shrimps were erratic and slow in their movements, with neonates showing most of these behavioral irregularities. This study shows that low levels of the herbicide Roundup (R) may adversely affect C. nilotica health and survival. Thus, the herbicide should be carefully managed to minimize any negative impact on non-target freshwater organisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As GBHs are more cytotoxic than glyphosate, we reasoned they may also be more capable of activating carcinogenic pathways. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of glyphosate with Roundup GBHs both in vitro and in vivo. First, glyphosate was compared with representative GBHs, namely MON 52276 (European Union), MON 76473 (United Kingdom), and MON 76207 (United States) using the mammalian stem cell-based ToxTracker system. Here, MON 52276 and MON 76473, but not glyphosate and MON 76207, activated oxidative stress and unfolded protein responses. Second, molecular profiling of liver was performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to glyphosate or MON 52276 (at 0.5, 50, and 175 mg/kg bw/day glyphosate) for 90 days. MON 52276 but not glyphosate increased hepatic steatosis and necrosis. MON 52276 and glyphosate altered the expression of genes in liver reflecting TP53 activation by DNA damage and circadian rhythm regulation. Genes most affected in liver were similarly altered in kidneys. Small RNA profiling in liver showed decreased amounts of miR-22 and miR-17 from MON 52276 ingestion.

OBJECTIVES: We tested whether glyphosate or its representative EU herbicide formulation Roundup MON 52276 affects the rat gut microbiome. METHODS: We combined cecal microbiome shotgun metagenomics with serum and cecum metabolomics to assess the effects of glyphosate [0.5, 50, 175 mg=kg body weight oBW thorn per day] or MON 52276 at the same glyphosate-equivalent doses, in a 90-d toxicity test in rats. RESULTS: Glyphosate and MON 52276 treatment resulted in ceca accumulation of shikimic acid and 3-dehydroshikimic acid, suggesting inhibition of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase of the shikimate pathway in the gut microbiome. Cysteinylglycine, c-glutamylglutamine, and valylglycine levels were elevated in the cecal microbiome following glyphosate and MON 52276 treatments. Altered cecum metabolites were not differentially expressed in serum, suggesting that the glyphosate and MON 52276 impact on gut microbial metabolism had limited consequences on physiological biochemistry. Serum metabolites differentially expressed with glyphosate treatment were associated with nicotinamide, branched-chain amino acid, methionine, cysteine, and taurine metabolism, indicative of a response to oxidative stress. MON 52276 had similar, but more pronounced, effects than glyphosate on the serum metabolome. Shotgun metagenomics of the cecum showed that treatment with glyphosate and MON 52276 resulted in higher levels of Eggerthella spp., Shinella zoogleoides, Acinetobacter johnsonii, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Shinella zoogleoides was higher only with MON 52276 exposure. In vitro culture assays with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strains showed that Roundup GT plus inhibited growth at concentrations at which MON 52276 and glyphosate had no effect. DISCUSSION: Our study highlights the power of multi-omics approaches to investigate the toxic effects of pesticides. Multi-omics revealed that glyphosate and MON 52276 inhibited the shikimate pathway in the rat gut microbiome. Our findings could be used to develop biomarkers for epidemiologi cal studies aimed at evaluating the effects of glyphosate herbicides on humans. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6990",2021,129,,,10.1289/EHP6990
"Mesnage, R; Benbrook, C; Antoniou, MN",Insight into the confusion over surfactant co-formulants in glyphosate-based herbicides,FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate is the active ingredient in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEM were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are 100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted.

"Mie, A; Rudén, C",What you don't know can still hurt you-under reporting in EU pesticide regulation,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,"The safety evaluation of pesticides in the European Union (EU) relies to a large extent on toxicity studies commissioned and funded by the industry. The herbicide glyphosate and four of its salts are currently under evaluation for renewed market approval in the EU. The safety documentation submitted by the applicant companies does not include any animal study regarding developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) that is compliant with test guidelines. For a fifth salt, not included in the present application for re-approval, such a DNT study was sponsored by one of the applicant companies in 2001. That study shows an effect of that form of glyphosate on a neurobehavioural function, motor activity, in rat offspring at a dose previously not known to cause adverse effects. Counter to regulatory requirements, these effects were apparently not communicated to authorities in EU countries where that form of glyphosate was authorised at that time. That DNT study may also be relevant for the ongoing assessment of glyphosate but was not included in the present or previous applications for re-approval.

We argue that the legal obligation for industry to submit all potentially relevant data to EU authorities is clear and far-reaching, but that these obligations were not fulfilled in this case. We claim that authorities cannot reliably pursue a high level of protection of human health, if potentially relevant evidence is withheld from them. We suggest that a retrospective cross-check of lists of studies performed by test laboratories against studies submitted to regulatory authorities should be performed, in order to investigate the completeness of data submitted to authorities. We further suggest that future toxicity studies should be commissioned by authorities rather than by companies, to improve the authorities' oversight over existing data and to prevent that economic conflicts of interest affect the reporting of study results and conclusions.",2022,21,,,10.1186/s12940-022-00891-7
"Miko, Z; Hettyey, A","Toxicity of POEA-containing glyphosate-based herbicides to amphibians is mainly due to the surfactant, not to the active ingredient",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Current international legislation regarding agrochemicals requires thorough toxicological testing mainly of the active ingredients. In a 96-h acute toxicity test we exposed Rana dalmatina and Bufo bufo tadpoles to either one of three concentrations of glyphosate, three concentrations of the surfactant (POEA), three concentrations of the two components together, or to non-contaminated water (control), and subsequently assessed mortality and body mass. To investigate whether simultaneous exposure to another stress factor influences effects of the contaminants, we performed tests both in the presence or absence of predator chemical cues. We found that the surfactant had significant harmful effects on tadpoles; survival was lowered by the highest concentration of the surfactant in case of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo tadpoles it reduced survival already at medium concentrations. Body mass was significantly influenced by medium and high surfactant concentrations in both species. The presence of glyphosate did not have a significant effect by itself, but it slightly increased mortality in tadpoles exposed to medium concentrations of the surfactant in both species. The presence of chemical cues did not have an effect on the examined variables. Our study confirms that the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides is mainly due to the examined surfactant. Nonetheless, we found that glyphosate can enhance the harmful effect of the surfactant. These results stress that during the authorization process of new pesticide formulations, not only the active ingredients would need to be examined but the excipients should also be taken into account in an obligatory and systematic manner.",2023,32,150,159,10.1007/s10646-023-02626-x

The most commonly applied broad-spectrum herbicides in the world are glyphosate-based herbicides, which have been suggested to induce significant behavioural changes in non-target organisms even at low environmental concentrations. To scrutinize the behavioural effects of herbicide-exposure we exposed agile frog (Rana dalmatina) tadpoles in an outdoor mesocosm experiment to three concentrations of a glyphosate-based herbicide (0, 2 and 6.5 mg acid equivalent (a.e.) / L). To assess whether anti-predator behaviour is affected by the pesticide, we combined all levels of herbicide-exposure with three predator treatments (no predator, caged Aeshna cyanea dragonfly larvae or Lissotriton vulgaris newt adults) in a full factorial design. We observed hiding, activity, proximity to the predator cage and vertical position of tadpoles. We found that at the higher herbicide concentration tadpoles decreased their activity and more tadpoles were hiding, and at least at the lower concentration their vertical position was closer to the water surface than in tadpoles of the control treatment. Tadpoles also decreased their activity in the presence of dragonfly larvae, but did not hide more in response to either predator, nor did tadpoles avoid predators spatially. Further, exposure to the herbicide did not significantly influence behavioural responses to predation threat. Our study documents a definite influence of glyphosate-based herbicides on the behaviour of agile frog tadpoles and indicates that some of these changes are similar to those induced by dangerous predators. This may suggest that the underlying physiological mechanisms or the adaptive value of behavioural changes may similar.",2017,140,96,102,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.02.032

Recent studies revealed that glyphosate occurs in soil, surface water, and groundwater, and residues are found at all levels of the food chain, such as drinking water, plants, animals, and even in humans. While research has demonstrated that glyphosate can induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms, the global molecular mechanisms of action still need to be elucidated, in particular for marine species. In this study, we characterized for the first time the molecular mechanisms of action of glyphosate in a marine bivalve species after exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations. To reach such a goal, Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, an ecologically and economically relevant species, were exposed for 21 days to 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L and digestive gland transcriptional profiles were investigated through RNA-seq. Differential expression analysis identified a total of 111, 124, and 211 differentially regulated transcripts at glyphosate concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L, respectively. Five genes were found consistently differentially expressed at all investigated concentrations, including SERP2, which plays a role in the protection of unfolded target proteins against degradation, the antiapoptotic protein GIMAP5, and MTMR14, which is involved in macroautophagy. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals the disruption of several key biological processes, such as energy metabolism and Ca2+ homeostasis, cell signalling, and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Together, the results obtained suggest that the presence of glyphosate in the marine ecosystem should raise particular concern because of its significant effects even at the lowest concentration.

Fish were acutely exposed (6, 24 and 96 h) to 10 mg L-1 of Roundup (R) (RD) or only water (control) and samples of liver, for antioxidants analysis, and brain and muscle, for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) determination, were collected. Fish exposed to RD for 24 h showed reduction on superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, and increased glutathione (GSH) content. After 24 and 96 h, fish of RD group showed increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. AChE activity was inhibited in brain after 96 h and in muscle after 24 and 96 h of exposure. Thus, acute exposure to RD stimulated the biotransformation pathway, with increased GST, but interfered on the antioxidant defenses, with reduction of SOD and GPx activity, leading to the occurrence of lipid peroxidation oxidation. Inhibition of AChE showed that RD acts as a contaminant with anti-AChE action. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010,78,294,299,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.10.047

Advantages of the method include its simplicity (no laborious extraction) and specificity (cross-reactivity is below 0.1% for related compounds, e.g. aminomethyl-phosphonic acid, glufosinate). On the basis of our experiments, the practical limit of detection (LOD) ranged between 0.05 and 0.12 ng/ml. The standard curve was of sigmoid (logistic) characteristics, and it co-occurred with curves obtained for spiked surface water samples. Matrix effects were observed in tap water, possibly due to chlorination and/or heavy metal ions, e.g. copper and zinc. The method was applied for the analysis of 42 surface and ground water samples collected from Bekes county in Hungary at 14 sampling sites in 2010 and 18 surface water samples collected from the Danube River and Lake Velencei in Hungary at 12 sampling sites in 2011. Exceedingly high glyphosate levels (nearly 1 ng/ml) were measured in 5 samples, and significant concentrations were determined in 16 cases (0.54-0.76 ng/ml) in 2010, while practically no contamination was found in 2011. The great contrast between the two sampling regimes is explained by differing agricultural locations, natural precipitation and, to a greater extent, catchment area characteristics, resulting in varying leaching or run-off of glyphosate to surface waters.

Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine acid, is a nonselective post-emergent herbicide and is formulated as an isopropylamine salt with the surfactant taloamine polyethoxylate (POEA) representing the commercial formulation of Roundup (R). There is little knowledge about the effects of the herbicide on helminth parasites, particularly those whose life cycle is related to water bodies. Here we investigated the effects of the Roundup (R) on the food-borne trematode Echinostoma paraensei in experimental conditions using different developmental stages (eggs, miracidia, cercariae, metacercariae, newly excysted larvae (NEL), helminths at seven days and helminths at fourteen days). Three different herbicide concentrations were tested based on concentrations typically applied in the field: 225, 450 and 900 mg/L. Specimens were analyzed in vitro for hatching miracidia, mortality and excystment rate of metacercariae and in vivo for parasitic load and egg production. There was a significant difference in the hatching miracidia rate only for the newly embryonated eggs. The mortality of specimens and excystment rate of metacercariae were concentration-dependent. There was a significant difference in the miracidia mortality with respect to concentration until 56.3 mg/L. The same effect was observed for cercariae, and mortality was observed from 15 min onwards at concentrations of 225-900 mg/L. At low concentrations, mortality was detected after 30 min. The effects of the herbicide concentration on NEL and on helminths at seven and fourteen days showed a significant difference after 24 h. There was no significant difference in parasitic load and egg production after infection of rodents with exposed metacercariae. All developmental stages of the trematode E. paraensei were affected by Roundup (R) exposure under experimental conditions. These results suggest that dynamics of transmission of the trematode could be affected in the natural environments. The study also reinforces the usefulness of this trematode as a good model organism to test pesticides regarding human and environmental health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Moore, LJ; Fuentes, L; Rodgers, JH; Bowerman, WW; Yarrow, GK; Chao, WY; Bridges, WC",Relative toxicity of the components of the original formulation of Roundup® to five North American anurans,ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"The responses of five North American frog species that were exposed in an aqueous system to the original formulation of Roundup (R) were compared. Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup (R) to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22 mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32 mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96 h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians. These study results suggest that anurans are among the most sensitive species, and emphasize the importance of testing the herbicide formulation in addition to its separate components to accurately characterize the toxicity and potential risk of the formulation.

Environmental metabolomics methods that combine quantitative measurements of metabolite levels and multivariate statistical analysis are powerful tools for ascertaining biological impacts and identifying potential biomarkers of exposure. We propose the use of the saltwater aquatic crustacean, Anemia franciscana, as a model organism for environmental metabolomics in saltwater ecosystems. Artemia are a good choice for ecotoxicity assays and metabolomics analysis because they have a short life cycle, their hemolymph is rich in metabolites and they tolerate a wide salinity range. In this work we explore the potential of Anemia franciscana for environmental metabolomics through exposure to the broad-spectrum herbicide, glyphosate. The LC50 for a 48 h exposure of Roundup (R) was determined to be 237 +/- 23 ppm glyphosate in the Roundup (R) formulation. Anemia cysts were hatched and exposed to sub-lethal glyphosate concentrations of 1.00, 10.0, 50.0, or 100 ppm glyphosate in Roundup (R). We profiled 48 h old Anemia extracts using H-1 NMR and GC-MS. Dose-dependent metabolic perturbation was evident for several metabolites using univariate and multivariate analyses. Metabolites significantly affected by Roundup (R) exposure included aspartate, formate, betaine, glucose, tyrosine, phenylalanine, gadusol, and isopropylamine.

Glyphosate and AMPA persistence and spatial distribution in the long-term. A conceptual model,SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH,"Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in a no-tilled (NT) soil and in the runoff resulting from the rain simulation carried out after 270 days of the application of the herbicide. Glyphosate concentration was in low values in runoff water but was not detected in the soil. In contrast, AMPA was found only in soil samples (same LOD/LOQ for both molecules). These intriguing results, on the one hand have led us to develop a conceptual model explaining the dynamics of glyphosate in NT soils with strongly developed platy structures resulting from this soil management, and, on the other hand, to underline the requirement of certain methodological precautions when analyzing properties of such stratified surface horizons. In our model, glyphosate was mostly degraded into AMPA although a small part remained adsorbed and trapped in the plates in the upper soil layer. In the field test, platy aggregates were destroyed by the raindrop impacts, glyphosate was washed off and transported in solution or bound to eroded soil particles. Glyphosate was not detected in soil analysis mainly due to the reduced volume of the surface plates in the total sample and, to a lesser extent, some loss of surface soil material during samples preparation due to its high content of roots and plant debris. In contrast, AMPA leached preferentially and became trapped in the micropores of the dense layer. Therefore, its absence in the runoff and its relatively high proportion in the soil would be due to its accumulation and preservation in the lower portion of the A horizon. The long persistence of AMPA would be explained not only by its physical occlusion in small pores preventing microbial accessibility, but also by a low diffusivity of oxygen and water restricting biotic and abiotic degra-dation processes. It is suggested that an integrative approach considering both the physical behaviour and the architecture of the soil at different scales in the laboratory and in the field, can contribute to understanding the fate of glyphosate and other agrochemicals in NT soils.",2022,223,,,10.1016/j.still.2022.105471

The present study aimed to assess the toxicity of a POEA surfactant system, the Genamin T-200 (R), on two larval stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of Genamin T-200 (R) was quantified after 36 hr of exposure, considering both arrested development and abnormalities in D-shaped larvae. The ability of pediveliger larvae to metamorphose was studied after 24 hr exposure to Genamin T200 (R). According to the European toxicity classification, the present results suggest that Genamin T-200 (R) could be considered very toxic to embryo larval development, with an EC50 of 262 mu g/l, and toxic to metamorphosis processes with an EC50 of 3,027 mu g/l.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient, on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h. Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values. Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an old embryo stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of 1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

The results show that the bodyweight index was the most sensitive toxicity parameter wherein a reduction in body weight was observed at 25 mg/L of glyphosate. Negative correlations between the glyphosate concentration and toxicity parameters such as specific growth rate (SGR), hepato-somatic index (HIS), and gonado-somatic index (GSI) were observed. The fish condition factor and feed conversion ratio were found to be unaffected at the highest glyphosate concentration tested (150 mg/L). The development of glyphosate-resistant genetically modified organisms (GMO) has increased the use of herbicide glyphosate by several magnitudes in recent years. It is now the most commonly used pesticide globally that affects aquatic habitats, especially fish. This study aims to add new knowledge on the effect of technical grade glyphosate on several toxicity parameters and to identify the most effective parameter in predicting technical grade glyphosate chronic toxicity (seven weeks) to fish, especially Malaysia's heavily farmed red tilapia. The results show that a relatively high concentration of technical grade glyphosate is needed to induce significant changes in all tested parameters. However, the results also indicate that the bodyweight index is the most sensitive toxicity parameter in that a reduction in body weight was observed at 25 mg/L of glyphosate. Negative correlations between the glyphosate concentration and toxicity parameters such as specific growth rate (SGR), hepato-somatic index (HIS), and gonado-somatic index (GSI) were observed. The fish condition factor and feed conversion ratio were found not to be affected at the highest glyphosate concentration tested (150 mg/L).

Compared with CTR, liver of fish exposed to POEA 2 and POEA 3 showed increased activity of 7 ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and increased content of glutathione, whereas the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was diminished. On the other hand, fish of the group POEA 1 showed an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and in the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Fish exposed to POEA 3 presented increased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase and reduced plasma cortisol. The exposure to POEA at all concentrations tested caused an increase in plasma lactate and a decrease in the hepatic activity of catalase, in the number of red blood cells and in hemoglobin content The comet assay used for analyzing DNA damage in blood cells indicated the genotoxicity of the surfactant at all concentrations tested.

Tadpoles were chronically exposed in the laboratory from Gosner developmental stage 25 to 42 to four different concentrations of VisionMax (R) (ranging from 0.021 to 2.9 mg acid equivalents/L). Chronic exposures to VisionMax (R) had direct effects on the metamorphosis of L. sylvaticus tadpoles by decreasing development rates, however, there was a decrease in survival only in the group exposed to the highest dose of VisionMax (R) (2.9 mg a.e./L; from approximately 96% in the control group to 77% in the treatment group). There was a decrease in the number of tadpoles reaching metamorphic climax, from 78% in the control group to 42% in the VisionMax (R) (2.9 mg a.e./L) group, and a 7-day delay to reach metamorphic climax in the same treatment group. No effects of exposure on sex ratios or gonadal morphology were detected in tadpoles exposed to any of the concentrations of VisionMax (R) tested. Gene expression analyses in brain and tail tissues demonstrated that exposure to VisionMax (R) alters the expression of key genes involved in development. Results showed significant interaction (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05) between developmental Gosner stage and treatment in brain corticotropin-releasing factor, deiodinase type II (dio2) and glucocorticodroid receptor (grII) and tail dio2 and grII This demonstrates that mRNA levels may be differently affected by treatment depending on the developmental stage at which they are assessed. At the same time there was a clear dose-response effect for VisionMax (R) to increase thyroid hormone receptor beta in tadpole brain (F-(2,F-69) = 3.475, P = 0.037) and tail (F-(2,F-69) = 27.569, P < 0.001), regardless of developmental stage. Interestingly, delays in development (or survival) were only observed in the group exposed to 2.9 mg a.e./L of VisionMax (R), suggesting that tadpoles need to be exposed to a threshold concentration of glyphosate-based herbicide to exhibit phenotypic observable effects. We suggest that the upregulation of genes that trigger metamorphosis following VisionMax (R) herbicide exposure might result from a compensatory response for the delays in development observed. Further studies are needed to determine if disruption of expression of these key genes leads to long-term effects when metamorphs reach adult stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Niedobová, J; Skalsky, M; Ourednícková, J; Michalko, R; Bartosková, A",Synergistic effects of glyphosate formulation herbicide and tank-mixing adjuvants on Pardosa spiders,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are the world's most consumed agrochemicals, and they are commonly used in various agroecosystems, including forests, as well as in urban zones and gardens. These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R), and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the assembly processes that shape microbial communities are vulnerable to a range of environmental stressors, such as climate change, eutrophication, and the use of herbicides. Despite the importance of these stressors, little is known about their cumulative impacts on microbial community assembly in aquatic ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we established 48 mesocosm experiments that simulated shallow lake ecosystems and subjected them to warming (including continuous warming (W) and heat waves (H)), glyphosate-based herbicides (G), and nutrient loading (E). Our study revealed that in the control group, both deterministic and stochastic processes codominated the assembly of microbial communities in water, whereas in sediment, the processes were primarily stochastic. Interestingly, the effects of multiple stress factors on assembly in these two habitats were completely opposite. Specifically, stressors promoted the dominance of stochastic processes in water but increased the importance of deterministic processes in sediment. Furthermore, warming amplified the effects of herbicides but exerted an opposite and stronger influence on assembly compared to nutrients, emphasizing the complexity of these mechanisms and the significance of considering multiple stressors. The interaction of some factors significantly affected assembly (p < 0.05), with the effects of WEG being most pronounced in water. Both water and sediment exhibited homogeneous assembly of microbial communities (mean NTI >0), but the phylogenetic clustering of microbial communities in water was more closely related (NTI >2). Our research revealed the response model of microbial community assembly in aquatic ecosystems to multiple environmental stresses, such as agricultural pollution, climate change, and eutrophication, and indicated that microbial community changes in sediment may be an important predictor of lake ecosystem development. This provides scientific evidence that better environmental management can reduce impacts on aquatic ecosystems under the threat of future warming.",2024,350,,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119594

The acute toxicity interactions were predicted mathematically using Abbott's model and multiple toxicological endpoints. In the multigenerational tests, we evaluated the effects in filial (F1 and F2) generations of daphnids after parental (F0) exposure to Gly and PSNP, as individual compounds and as a mixture, during their life history. Based on Abbott's model, the combined individual toxicities of Gly and PSNP are increased when they are present as a mixture. This indicates synergy between the components of the mixture, especially in the case of co-exposure to Gly and PSNP in higher equitoxic proportions. The mixture of PSNP and Gly caused an increase in immobility and ROS production and decrease in swimming activity. Multigenerational responses indicated that the exposure of F0 daphnids to Gly and PSNP as a mixture induced effects in the F1 and F2 reproduction parameters in the recovery tests. Thus, the results reported herein provide important information on the interaction of hydrophilic organic and nanoplastic pollutants in aqueous ecosystems. This will be useful in future studies on the toxicity of mixtures and multigenerational effects and provide a basis for management decisions aimed at the protection of environmental health.

Three sublethal test concentrations of the herbicide viz., SL-I (1/10th of LC50=similar to 3.25 mg L-1), SL-II (1/8th of LC50=similar to 4.07 mg L-1) and SL-III (1/5th of LC50=similar to 6.51 mg L-1) were calculated using 96-LC50 value and the test specimens were exposed to these concentrations. Blood and gill cells of the exposed specimens were sampled on day 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 to examine the DNA damage using comet assay and to assess the alteration in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes activities. The highest DNA damage was observed on day 14 at all test concentrations followed by gradual non-linear decline. Induction of oxidative stress in the blood and gill cells were evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation level, while antioxidants namely superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase responded in a concentration-dependent manner. The results supported the integrated use of comet and antioxidant assays in determining the toxicity of water pollutants which could be used as part of monitoring programs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Such studies are crucial for improving our understanding of the impact of these substances on stream ecology. In this study, we assess the effects of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; the main degradation product of glyphosate) on the photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate and chlorophyll a content of Nitella microcarpa var. wrightii, a green algae found worldwide. Three concentrations of technical-grade glyphosate and Roundup were tested (0.28, 3.5 and 6 mg l(-1)), while for AMPA only one concentration was evaluated (0.03 mg l(-1)). Our results indicate that glyphosate has a stronger inhibitory effect on photosynthetic rate when applied in association with a surfactant (Roundup). These effects are related both to the concentration of the active ingredient and to exposure time. On the other hand, treatment with AMPA had a stimulatory effect on the photosynthetic rate, which may be associated with an increased supply of phosphorus available to the algae from the AMPA degradation process. From an ecological perspective, our results show that the ecological distribution of N. microcarpa var. wrightii, in terms of both spatial and temporal scales, can be affected by glyphosate-based herbicides in streams.",2016,55,577,584,10.2216/16-12.1
"Orsted, M; Roslev, P",A fluorescence-based hydrolytic enzyme activity assay for quantifying toxic effects of Roundup® to Daphnia magna,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Daphnia magna is a widely used model organism for aquatic toxicity testing. In the present study, the authors investigated the hydrolytic enzyme activity of D. magna after exposure to toxicant stress. In vivo enzyme activity was quantified using 15 fluorogenic enzyme probes based on 4-methylumbelliferyl or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Probing D. magna enzyme activity was evaluated using short-term exposure (24-48 h) to the reference chemical K2Cr2O7 or the herbicide formulation Roundup (R). Toxicant-induced changes in hydrolytic enzyme activity were compared with changes in mobility (International Organization for Standardization standard 6341). The results showed that hydrolytic enzyme activity was quantifiable as a combination of whole body fluorescence of D. magna and the fluorescence of the surrounding water. Exposure of D. magna to lethal and sublethal concentrations of Roundup resulted in loss of whole body enzyme activity and release of cell constituents, including enzymes and DNA. Roundup caused comparable inhibition of mobility and alkaline phosphatase activity with median effective concentration values at 20 degrees C of 8.7mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L to 11.7mga.i./L. Inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by Roundup was lowest at 14 degrees C and greater at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C. The results suggest that the fluorescence-based hydrolytic enzyme activity assay (FLEA assay) can be used as an index of D. magna stress.

Since the large number of contaminants makes it impossible to perform ecotoxicity tests for each potential mixture, a robust approach for prospective environmental risk assessment of chemical mixtures is needed. A number of recent publications by the European Commission and the authorities in charge prove the increasing interest that is spreading in the European community towards the topic of the assessment of chemical mixtures. The current EU regulation for Plant Protection Products authorization (Reg. 1107/2009 EC) explicitly requires the evaluation of the potential combined effects of active substances. We reviewed current methods and limitations of mixture assessment of pesticides (7 fungicides and 4 herbicides) through the analysis of the approaches adopted to investigate possible risks for different non-target organisms. The Concentration Addition (CA) approach was the most used approach to predict multiple toxicity to non-target organisms. The guidance for birds and mammals first introduced standard procedures to assess the multiple toxicity based on on CA concept The recent aquatic EFSA guidance introduced some requirements to evaluate potential mixture toxicity, while the current guidance requirements for terrestrial organisms still lack clear indications on how to conduct the assessment Moreover, new indications come from the draft guidance for the assessment of terrestrial plants and in-soil organisms. However, the approval and implementation of these new guidelines are still at a developmental stage. Some final considerations are drawn on the future possibilities to improve risk assessment procedures so as to identify harmful effects of pesticides mixtures on non-target organisms.

Its utilization in broad-spectrum herbicides, such as RoundUp(R), has continued to increase since 1974; glyphosate, as well as its primary metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid, is measured in soils, water, plants, animals and food. In humans, glyphosate is detected in blood and urine, especially in exposed workers, and is excreted within a few days. It has long been regarded as harmless in animals, but growing literature has reported health risks associated with glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides. In 2017, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic in humans. However, other national agencies did not tighten their glyphosate restrictions and even prolonged authorizations of its use. There are also discrepancies between countries' authorized levels, demonstrating an absence of a clear consensus on glyphosate to date. This review details the effects of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides on fish and mammal health, focusing on the immune system. Increasing evidence shows that glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides exhibit cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, increase oxidative stress, disrupt the estrogen pathway, impair some cerebral functions, and allegedly correlate with some cancers. Glyphosate effects on the immune system appear to alter the complement cascade, phagocytic function, and lymphocyte responses, and increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in fish. In mammals, including humans, glyphosate mainly has cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, causes inflammation, and affects lymphocyte functions and the interactions between microorganisms and the immune system. Importantly, even as many outcomes are still being debated, evidence points to a need for more studies to better decipher the risks from glyphosate and better regulation of its global utilization.",2020,17,163,174,10.1080/1547691X.2020.1804492

River water to which C-13-labelled glyphosate (10, 100 mu g L-1) was added or not (control) was incubated for 6 days at the temperature measured in situ (20 degrees C). Significant differences in bacterioplankton community composition, as assessed by microfluidics-based automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, were found among treatments, with differences in the presence of 100 mu g L-1 of glyphosate being more pronounced, namely significant decreases in bacterial richness and diversity.

"Prosser, RS; Rodriguez-Gil, JL; Solomon, KR; Sibley, PK; Poirier, DG",Effects of the herbicide surfactant MON 0818 on oviposition and viability of eggs of the ramshorn snail (Planorbella pilsbryi),ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"The surfactant mixture MON 0818 is an adjuvant in various commercial formulations of the herbicide glyphosate. Initial studies have shown that MON 0818 is more toxic to aquatic animals than the active ingredient. However, few studies have examined the effect of exposure to MON 0818 on species of mollusks, and no studies have examined the effect on gastropods. The present study investigated the effect of acute exposure (96h) of MON 0818 to the eggs, juveniles, and adults of the file ramshorn snail (Planorbella pilsbryi). Concentrations of MON 0818 up to 9.9mg/L did not have a significant effect on the viability of eggs (p>0.05). Juvenile snails (50% lethal concentration [LC50]=4.0mg/L) were more sensitive than adult snails (LC50=4.9-9.1mg/L). Oviposition was inhibited by exposure to MON 0818 (median effective concentration [EC50]=0.4-2.0mg/L). However, oviposition resumed when snails were removed to clean water, even after 96-h exposure to up to 4.9mg/L of MON 0818. Exposure to a concentration 2.7mg/L caused visible damage to the tentacles of adult snails, which could potentially impact chemoreception. A deterministic hazard assessment indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 could pose a hazard to the deposition of eggs. However, because of the relatively short half-life of MON 0818 in aquatic systems and the ability of snails to resume oviposition following the dissipation of MON 0818, environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 likely pose a de minimis risk to populations of ramshorn snails.

The physiological and biochemical responses of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) to glyphosate and its formulation in the common herbicide, Roundup((R)), were compared. The result suggested that both the cell numbers and Chl-a content of M. aeruginosa increased when the glyphosate concentration increased from 0.01 to 5 mg P L-1. However, Roundup((R)) showed low-dose (below I mg P L-1) stimulation and high-dose (above 1 mg P L-1) inhibition on M. aeruginosa cell density and Chl-a content (hormesis effect). Phosphate was more available than glyphosate or Roundup((R)), and Roundup((R)) was more toxic than glyphosate itself at 3 mg P L-1. Analysis of the maximum yield of PSII indicated that glyphosate stimulated the photosynthesis process while Roundup((R)) inhibited the photosynthesis of M. aeruginosa. The photosynthesis process was enhanced on the 21st day compared with that on the 14th day in all P mediums. The extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (AAA) decreased with the increasing glyphosate or Roundup((R)) concentration. The change pattern of APA was similar in both the glyphosate and Roundup((R)) mediums. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013,248,172,176,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.12.033
"Qu, MJ; Wang, LT; Xu, Q; An, JQ; Mei, YJ; Liu, GL",Influence of glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid on aquatic plants in different ecological niches,ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"Glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) draw great concern due to their potential threat to aquatic ecosystems. The individual and combined effects of glyphosate and AMPA on aquatic plants in different ecological niches need to be explored. This study aimed to investigate the ecotoxicity of glyphosate and AMPA on the emergent macrophyte Acorus calamus, phytoplankton Chlorella vulgaris, and submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans after their exposure to glyphosate and AMPA alone and to their mixture. Medium and low concentrations of glyphosate (< 0.5 mg L-1) significantly inhibited the growth of V. natans and promoted the growth of C. vulgaris (P < 0.05) but had no significant effect on the growth of A. calamus (P > 0.05). AMPA (< 5.0 mg L-1) did not significantly influence the relative growth rate (except C. vulgaris) or malonaldehyde levels but significantly altered the expression levels of chlorophyll-related genes and superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] genes in the aquatic plants examined. AMPA mainly affected the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in V. natans and not those in other two plants, indicating that V. natans was more sensitive to AMPA-induced oxidative damage. Moreover, antagonistic effects on plant growth were observed when plants were exposed to low concentrations of glyphosate + AMPA (< 0.1 + 0.1 mg L-1). When the concentration of glyphosate + AMPA reached 0.5 + 0.5 and 5.0 + 5.0 mg L-1, the growth of the submerged macrophyte was additively or syner-gistically inhibited, but the growth of the emergent macrophyte and phytoplankton was antagonistically inhibited. Our results indicated that both the individual and combined effects of glyphosate and AMPA might alter the vertical structure of shallow lakes and accelerate the conversion of shallow lakes from grass-based to algal-based lakes.",2022,246,,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114155
"Rainio, MJ; Margus, A; Tikka, S; Helander, M; Lindström, L",The effects of short-term glyphosate-based herbicide exposure on insect gene expression profiles,APPLIED ENERGY,"Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most frequently used herbicides worldwide. The use of GBHs is intended to tackle weeds, but GBHs have been shown to affect the life-history traits and antioxidant defense system of invertebrates found in agroecosystems. Thus far, the effects of GBHs on detoxification pathways among invertebrates have not been sufficiently investigated. We performed two different experiments-1) the direct pure glyphosate and GBH treatment, and 2) the indirect GBH experiment via food-to examine the possible effects of environmentally relevant GBH levels on the survival of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and the expression profiles of their detoxification genes. As candidate genes, we selected four cytochrome P450 (CYP), three glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) genes that are known to be related to metabolic or target-site resistances in insects. We showed that environmentally relevant levels of pure glyphosate and GBH increased the probability for higher mortality in the Colorado potato beetle larvae in the direct experiment, but not in the indirect experiment. The GBHs or glyphosate did not affect the expression profiles of the studied CYP, GST, or AChE genes; however, we found a large family-level variation in expression profiles in both the direct and indirect treatment experiments. These results suggest that the genes selected for this study may not be the ones expressed in response to glyphosate or GBHs. It is also possible that the relatively short exposure time did not affect gene expression profiles, or the response may have already occurred at a shorter exposure time. Our results show that glyphosate products may affect the survival of the herbivorous insect already at lower levels, depending on their sensitivity to pesticides.",2023,339,,,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2023.104503

Daphnia have been increasingly used in standardised testing of chemicals as they are well characterised and show sensitivity to pollutants, making them an essential indicator species for environmental stress. The mapping of the genomes of D. pulex in 2012 and D. magna in 2017 further consolidated their utility for ecotoxicity testing, including demonstrating the responsiveness of the Daphnia genome to environmental stressors. The short lifecycle and parthenogenetic reproduction make Daphnia useful for assessment of developmental toxicity and adaption to stress. The emergence of nanomaterials (NMs) and their safety assessment has introduced some challenges to the use of standard toxicity tests which were developed for soluble chemicals. NMs have enormous reactive surface areas resulting in dynamic interactions with dissolved organic carbon, proteins and other biomolecules in their surroundings leading to a myriad of physical, chemical, biological, and macromolecular transformations of the NMs and thus changes in their bioavailability to, and impacts on, daphnids. However, NM safety assessments are also driving innovations in our approaches to toxicity testing, for both chemicals and other emerging contaminants such as microplastics (MPs). These advances include establishing more realistic environmental exposures via medium composition tuning including pre-conditioning by the organisms to provide relevant biomolecules as background, development of microfluidics approaches to mimic environmental flow conditions typical in streams, utilisation of field daphnids cultured in the lab to assess adaption and impacts of pre-exposure to pollution gradients, and of course development of mechanistic insights to connect the first encounter with NMs or MPs to an adverse outcome, via the key events in an adverse outcome pathway. Insights into these developments are presented below to inspire further advances and utilisation of these important organisms as part of an overall environmental risk assessment of NMs and MPs impacts, including in mixture exposure scenarios.",2023,5,,,10.3389/ftox.2023.1178482
"Relyea, RA",New effects of Roundup on amphibians: Predators reduce herbicide mortality; herbicides induce antipredator morphology,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"The use of pesticides is important for growing crops and protecting human health by reducing the prevalence of targeted pest species. However, less attention is given to the potential unintended effects on nontarget species, including taxonomic groups that are of current conservation concern. One issue raised in recent years is the potential for pesticides to become more lethal in the presence of predatory cues, a phenomenon observed thus far only in the laboratory. A second issue is whether pesticides can induce unintended trait changes in nontarget species, particularly trait changes that might mimic adaptive responses to natural environmental stressors. Using outdoor mesocosms, I created simple wetland communities containing leaf litter, algae, zooplankton, and three species of tadpoles (wood frogs [Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus], leopard frogs [R. pipiens or L. pipiens], and American toads [Bufo americanus or Anaxyrus americanus]). I exposed the communities to a factorial combination of environmentally relevant herbicide concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L of Roundup Original MAX) crossed with three predator-cue treatments (no predators, adult newts [Notophthalmus viridescens], or larval dragonflies [A flax junius]). Without predator cues, mortality rates from Roundup were consistent with past studies. Combined with cues from the most risky predator (i.e., dragonflies), Roundup became less lethal (in direct contrast to past laboratory studies). This reduction in mortality was likely caused by the herbicide stratifying in the water column and predator cues scaring the tadpoles down to the benthos where herbicide concentrations were lower. Even more striking was the discovery that Roundup induced morphological changes in the tadpoles. In wood frog and leopard frog tadpoles, Roundup induced relatively deeper tails in the same direction and of the same magnitude as the adaptive changes induced by dragonfly cues. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show that a pesticide can induce morphological changes in a vertebrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the herbicide might be activating the tadpoles' developmental pathways used for antipredator responses. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that the world's most widely applied herbicide may have much further-reaching effects on nontarget species than previous considered.",2012,22,634,647,10.1890/11-0189.1

Five to six concentrations of four formulations of glyphosate (4-Gly) (Eskoba (R), Panzer Gold (R), Roundup Ultramax (R) and Sulfosato Touchdown (R)) were evaluated in both cladoceran species through acute tests and 15-day recovery tests in order to estimate the population dynamics of microcrustaceans. The endpoints of the recovery test were: survival, growth (number of molts), fecundity, and the intrinsic population growth rate (r). A matrix population model (MPM) was applied to r of the survivor individuals of the acute tests, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation study. Among the 4-Gly tested, Sulfosato Touchdown (R) was the one that showed higher toxicity, and C. dubia was the most sensitive species. The Monte Carlo simulation study showed an average value of lambda always <1 for D. magna, indicating that its populations would not be able to survive under natural environmental conditions after an acute Gly exposure between 0.25 and 35 a.e. mg L-1. The average value of lambda for C. dubia was also <1 after exposure to Roundup Ultramax (R) : 1.30 and 1.20 for 1.21 and 2.5 mg a.e. L-1,respectively.

"Riera, SF; Cohen, RA",Alkyl polyglucoside compound influences freshwater plankton community structure in floating field mesocosms,ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Synthetic surfactants in cleaners and detergents commonly contaminate freshwater systems, therefore use of low-toxicity alternatives is becoming increasingly important. Alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) derived from natural products are less toxic than synthetic surfactants, and degrade rapidly reducing chemical exposure time. However, single species toxicity tests showed APGs have toxic effects on aquatic primary producers and zooplankton, and that species demonstrate different sensitivities to APGs. Furthermore, species unaffected by APGs directly may be indirectly affected by removal of a food source or changes in predator densities, thereby changing plankton community structure. To determine the effects of APGs on plankton communities under environmental conditions, floating mesocosms were deployed in a shallow pond in southeast Georgia, USA and dosed with 0, 0.01, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg L-1 APG. Zooplankton community composition and abundance, phytoplankton abundance (as chlorophyll a), and water column dissolved oxygen concentration were determined weekly for 1 month. Zooplankton abundance decreased primarily due to loss of copepods, and community composition shifted toward small-bodied cladocerans (Bosmina sp.), and chlorophyll a concentrations declined by up to 81 % following exposure to APG concentrations of 2.5 mg L-1 or greater. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen never dropped below 5.70 mg L-1, but the observed declines of similar to 2 mg L-1 could become stressful during periods of high water temperatures. Nevertheless, the APG-induced shift from copepod to cladoceran dominated communities and decrease in autochthonous carbon availability has important implications for food availability and quality to higher trophic levels such as planktivorous fishes.",2016,25,1458,1467,10.1007/s10646-016-1697-8
"Rissoli, RZ; Abdalla, FC; Costa, MJ; Rantin, FT; McKenzie, DJ; Kalinin, AL",Effects of glyphosate and the glyphosate based herbicides Roundup Original® and Roundup Transorb® on respiratory morphophysiology of bullfrog tadpoles,CHEMOSPHERE,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in agriculture and are commonly found in water bodies. Roundup Original (R) (RO) contains an isopropylamine glyphosate (GLY) salt containing the surfactant POEA, while Roundup Transorb R (R) (RTR) contains a potassium salt of GLY with unknown surfactants. Both contain different compositions of so-called inert ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O-2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate ((V)over dot O-2 - mLO(2) Kg1 h(-1)) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) (V)over dot O-2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O-2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced (V)over dot O-2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O-2 diffusion distance to O-2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased (V)over dot O-2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of inert compounds and surfactants. (V)over dot O-2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in (V)over dot O-2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since data about the early proteomic response and toxic mechanisms of GBH in fish is very limited, the aim of this study was to investigate the early toxicity of GBH in the gills of guppies Poecilia reticulata using a proteomic approach associated with histopathological index. Median lethal concentration (LC50,96h) was determined and LC50,96h values of guppies exposed to GBH were 3.6 +/- 0.4 mg GLI L-1. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis associated with mass spectrometry, 14 proteins regulated by GBH were identified, which are involved in different cell processes, as energy metabolism, regulation and maintenance of cytoskeleton, nucleic acid metabolism and stress response. Guppies exposed to GBH at 1.82 mg GLI L-1 showed time-dependent histopathological response in different epithelial and muscle cell types. The histopathological indexes indicate that GBH cause regressive, vascular and progressive disorders in the gills of guppies. This study helped to unravel the molecular and tissue mechanisms associated with GBH toxicity, which are potential biomarkers for biomonitoring water pollution by herbicides. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the intensive use of GLY-based herbicides and their direct application on soils, some of their components, including the active ingredient, may reach the aquatic environment through direct run-off and leaching. The present study assessed the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the GLY-based formulation Atanor 48 (ATN) and its major constituents GLY, surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), as well as the main metabolite of GLY aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) on non-target aquatic organisms. The toxic effects of these chemicals were evaluated in the fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio), while genotoxic effects were investigated in the comet assays with cells from zebrafish larvae and rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2). GLY and AMPA caused no acute toxic effect, while ATN and POEA induced significant lethal effects in zebrafish (LC50-96 h 76.50 mg/L and 5.49 mg/L, respectively). All compounds were genotoxic in comet experiments with zebrafish larvae (LOEC 1.7 mg/L for GLY, ATN, AMPA and 0.4 mg/L for POEA). Unlike in vivo, only POEA induced DNA damage in RTG-2 cells (LOEC 1.6 mg/L), suggesting that it is a direct acting genotoxic agent. In summary, these data indicate that the lethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages can be ranked in the following order from most to least toxic: surfactant POEA > formulation ATN > active ingredient GLY approximate to metabolite AMPA. Genotoxic effects were observed in both RTG-2 cells (only POEA) and zebrafish (all test compounds) with the lowest tested concentrations. Therefore, it is important to evaluate different toxicological endpoints as well as use different non-target organisms to predict the hazards of GLY-based formulations and their components and breakdown product to aquatic biota.",2019,842,94,101,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2019.05.002

Considering this controversy, the objective of the present study was to investigate, in vitro, the effects of glyphosate exposure on cholinesterase activity of the brown mussel Perna perna and of two fish species: zebrafish Danio rerio and onesided livebearer Jenynsia multidentata. For this purpose, samples of different tissues (brain and muscle for fish; gills and muscle for mussel) were homogenized and pre-incubated with different glyphosate concentrations before cholinesterase activity determination. Results demonstrated that cholinesterase from different fractions of all species tested was inhibited by glyphosate. The concentrations of glyphosate that inhibits 50% of cholinesterase activity (IC50) ranged from 0.62 mM for P. perna muscle to 8.43 mM for J. multidentata brain. According to this, cholinesterase from mussel seems to be more sensitive to glyphosate exposure than those from the fish D. rerio and J. multidentata. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In microcosms, addition of glyphosate to Sandusky Bay water resulted in a significant increase in phytoplankton abundance, specifically causing an increase in the abundance of Planktothrix spp. In microcosms using Maumee Bay water, glyphosate did not stimulate phytoplankton growth but caused a decrease in Microcystis spp. abundance. The difference in the ability of Planktothrix spp. and Microcystis spp. to grow in the presence of glyphosate was confirmed in laboratory growth experiments. Further, an examination of the molecular pathways involved in phosphonate metabolism demonstrated that heterotrophic bacteria may be critical in allowing this proliferation. The results indicate that glyphosate has both positive and negative influences on phytoplankton community structure, serving as a nutrient source to microbes able to tolerate the herbicidal effects of the compound while killing those less tolerant.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water.

The occurrence of glyphosate residues in European water bodies is rather well documented whereas only few, fragmented and outdated information is available for European soils. We provide the first large-scale assessment of distribution (occurrence and concentrations) of glyphosate and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in EU agricultural topsoils, and estimate their potential spreading by wind and water erosion. Glyphosate and/or AMPA were present in 45% of the topsoils collected, originating from eleven countries and six crop systems, with a maximum concentration of 2 mg kg(-1). Several glyphosate and AMPA hotspots were identified across the EU. Soil loss rates (obtained from recently derived European maps) were used to estimate the potential export of glyphosate and AMPA by wind and water erosion. The estimated exports, result of a conceptually simple model, clearly indicate that particulate transport can contribute to human and environmental exposure to herbicide residues. Residue threshold values in soils are urgently needed to define potential risks for soil health and off site effects related to export by wind and water erosion. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Glycogen content, glucose, lactate, and protein levels were measured in different tissues. Plasma levels of cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also determined. Ventilatory frequency (VF) and swimming activity (SA) were considered behavior parameters. Results showed that herbicide exposure decreased plasma glucose levels and increased it in surubim liver. Lactate increased in both plasma and liver but decreased in muscle. Protein levels decreased in plasma and muscle but increased in liver. After herbicide exposure, liver and muscle glycogen was decreased. Cholesterol levels decreased in plasma at all concentrations tested. Plasma ALT increased, and no alterations were recorded for AST levels. VF increased after glyphosate exposure (5 min) and decreased after 96 h. SA showed differences among all groups (5 min). At the end of 96 h, SA was altered by the 7.5 mg L-1 concentration. Fish used anaerobic glycolysis as indicated by generally decreased glycogen levels and decreased lactate levels in muscle but increased ones in plasma and liver. We suggest that the studied parameters could be used as indicators of herbicide toxicity in surubim and may provide extremely important information for understanding the biology of the animal and its responsiveness to external stimuli (stressors).",2014,67,659,667,10.1007/s00244-014-0073-z

These transformations have caused the loss of habitat and biodiversity, and disruption of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. As a result of the expansion of the agricultural frontier in the recent past, many areas of the natural geographic distribution of the local wildlife, among them crocodilians and particularly the broad snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), are being exposed to contaminants. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of commercially-mixed glyphosate (RU) on some parameters of the immune system of C. latirostris. Two groups of caimans were exposed for two months to different concentrations of RU recommended for its application in the field, while one group was maintained as an unexposed control. The RU concentration was progressively decreased through the exposure period to simulate glyphosate degradation in water. After exposure, total and differential white blood cell (WBC), and complement system activity (CS) were determined. In addition, the animals were injected with a solution of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli to trigger an immune response and evaluate the parameters associated with it. The results showed that an effect of the herbicide on CS was observed, as animals exposed to RU showed a lower CS activity than animals from the negative control (NC) but not in total WBC. In the case of leukocyte population counts, differences were only found for heterophils and lymphocytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016,244,64,70,10.1016/j.cbi.2015.11.031

Here, the effects of the exposure (96 h) of a phytoplankton community collected in an agricultural stream to various glyphosate concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mu g l(-1)) of Factor 540 (R) GBH were investigated. The lowest GBH concentration of 1 mu g l(-1) reduced chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents. Low glyphosate concentrations, such as 5 and 10 mu g l(-1), promoted changes in the community's structure and reduced the diversity of the main algal species. At glyphosate concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 mu g l(-1), the phytoplankton community's composition was modified and new main species appeared. The highest glyphosate concentrations (500 and 1000 mu g l(-1)) affected the shikimate content, the lipid peroxidation and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase). These results indicate that GBH can modify structural and functional properties of freshwater phytoplankton communities living in streams located in agricultural areas at glyphosate concentrations much inferior to the 800 mu g l(-1) threshold set by the Canadian guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Factor 540((R))) on growth and photosynthetic capacity of algae and cyanobacteria. Six algal and three cyanobacterial species/strains, of three different taxonomic groups, were exposed to five glyphosate concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mu g l(-1)) during 48 h. All species have significant growth inhibition at concentrations varying between 50 and 500 mu g l(-1). The photosynthetic response, after glyphosate exposure, varied among species, but a general pattern has emerged. There was an increase in the amount of photons absorbed (ABS/RC), in dissipated (DIo/RC) and trapped (TRWRC) energy in the photosystem II reaction centers, along with a decreased of the maximum photosystem II quantum yield (Fv/ FM) and electron transport per reaction center (ETo/RC). The EC50 and LOEC values for growth and photosynthesis were calculated and established that growth was the most affected parameter by glyphosate-based herbicide, while parameter TRo/RC was the least affected. All species showed reduced growth at glyphosate concentrations lower than the Canadian standard for the protection of aquatic life, set at 800 mu g l(-1) or the American aquatic life benchmark for acute toxicity in non vascular plants of 12 100 mu g l(-1) questioning the validity of these thresholds in assessing the risks related to the presence of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides in aquatic systems.",2017,192,265,273,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.09.021

Within this frame, the sensitivity of the macrophyte Lemna gibba L. to Roundup((R)) Max was studied in standardized laboratory conditions and field experiments. In the laboratory, phytotoxic effects were assessed on the growth rate (GR) and total chlorophyll content (TCC). The GR was affected at 1 mg/L and TCC at 7.5 mg/L as active ingredient. Effects varied along testing time: toxicity was higher at low concentrations at the beginning, but diminishing during exposure, while at higher concentrations toxicity increments during testing. Also, a reduction of frond and root growth was detected. Field experiments with caged plants placed close to field crops showed an inhibition of 35.5 % in biomass production (dry weight) and 75.5 % in TCC when a dose of I kg/ha was applied. Although, in a second dose, only an inhibition effect on TCC of 53.9 % was detected. The assessment of the herbicide drift did not show an influence of this exposure route on the plants for the studied scenery. The lowest glyphosate concentration producing an effect in the laboratory is in agreement with the detected levels of the herbicide in the water body associated with effects in field experiments.",2007,17,31,39,
"Softeland, L; Olsvik, PA",In vitro toxicity of glyphosate in Atlantic salmon evaluated with a 3D hepatocyte-kidney co-culture model,FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY,"A novel 3D Atlantic salmon co-culture model was developed using primary hepatocytes and kidney epithelial cells isolated from the same fish. Mono and co-cultures of primary hepatocytes and kidney epithelial cells were exposed for 48 h to glyphosate (5, 50 and 500 mu M). For comparison, cells were also exposed to chlorpyrifos, benzo(a)pyrene and cadmium. Cell staining, cell viability assessments, RT-qPCR and global metabolomic profiling were used to examine the toxicological effects on liver and renal function and to compare responses in 3D and 2D cultures. The 3D hepatocyte cell culture was considered superior to the 2D culture due to the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (Abcb1) response and was thus used further in co-culture with kidney cells. Metabolomic analysis of co-cultured cells showed that glyphosate exposure (500 mu M) altered lipid metabolism in both hepatocytes and kidney cells. Elevated levels of several types of PUFAs and long-chain fatty acids were observed in exposed hepatocytes, owing to increased uptake and phospholipid remodelling. Glyphosate suppressed the expression of estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) and vitellogenin (Vtg) and altered histidine metabolism in exposed hepatocytes. Increased levels of cholesterol and downregulation of clusterin (Clu) suggest that glyphosate treatment affected membrane stability in Atlantic salmon kidney cells. This study demonstrates the usefulness of applying 3D co-culture models in risk assessment.",2022,164,,,10.1016/j.fct.2022.113012

Although reports about the impact of GLY in snails, crustaceans and amphibians exist, few studies have investigated its sublethal effects in non-target organisms such as the honeybee Apis mellifera, the main pollen vector in commercial crops. Here, we tested whether exposure to three sublethal concentrations of GLY (2.5, 5 and 10 mg l(-1): corresponding to 0.125, 0.250 and 0.500 mu g per animal) affects the homeward flight path of honeybees in an open field. We performed an experiment in which forager honeybees were trained to an artificial feeder, and then captured, fed with sugar solution containing traces of GLY and released from a novel site either once or twice. Their homeward trajectories were tracked using harmonic radar technology. We found that honeybees that had been fed with solution containing 10 mg l(-1) GLY spent more time performing homeward flights than control bees or bees treated with lower concentrations. They also performed more indirect homing flights. Moreover, the proportion of direct homeward flights performed after a second release from the same site increased in control bees but not in treated bees. These results suggest that, in honeybees, exposure to levels of GLY commonly found in agricultural settings impairs the cognitive capacities needed to retrieve and integrate spatial information for a successful return to the hive. Therefore, honeybee navigation is affected by ingesting traces of the most widely used herbicide worldwide, with potential long-term negative consequences for colony foraging success.",2015,218,2799,2805,10.1242/jeb.117291

These treatments should be accompanied by studies of the recovery potential of aquatic communities and ecosystems. We evaluated the potential of freshwater periphyton to recover from glyphosate exposure using microcosms under laboratory conditions. Periphyton developed on artificial substrates was exposed to 0.4 or 4 mg l(-1) monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (IPA) for 7 days, followed by translocation to herbicide-free water. We sampled the community 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the transfer. Dry weight, ash-free dry weight, chlorophyll a, and periphyton abundances were analysed. The periphyton impacted with the lowest IPA concentration recovered most of the structural parameters within 7 days in clean water, but the taxonomic structure did not entirely recover towards the control structure. Periphyton exposed to 4 mg IPA l(-1) could not recover during 21 days in herbicide-free water, reaching values almost four times higher in % of dead diatoms and four times lower in ash-free dry weight concerning the control at the end of the study. Results suggest a long-lasting effect of the herbicide due to the persistence within the community matrix even after translocating periphyton to decontaminated water. We conclude that the exposure concentration modulates the recovery potential of IPA-impacted periphyton. The current research is the first to study the recovery in glyphosate-free water of periphyton exposed to the most commonly used herbicide in the world. Finally, we highlight the need for more studies focused on the recovery potential of freshwater ecosystems and aquatic communities after glyphosate contamination.",2021,290,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117998

The effect of the formulation Glifosato Atanor(A (R)) on freshwater microbial communities (phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, periphyton and zooplankton) was assessed through a manipulative experiment using six small outdoor microcosms of small volume. Three of the microcosms were added with 3.5 mg l(-1) of glyphosate whereas the other three were left as controls without the herbicide. The treated microcosms showed a significant increase in total phosphorus, not fully explained by the glyphosate present in the Glifosato Atanor(A (R)). Therefore, part of the phosphorus should have come from the surfactants of the formulation. The results showed significant direct and indirect effects of Glifosato Atanor(A (R)) on the microbial communities. A single application of the herbicide caused a fast increase both in the abundance of bacterioplankton and planktonic picocyanobacteria and in chlorophyll a concentration in the water column. Although metabolic alterations related to oxidative stress were induced in the periphyton community, the herbicide favored its development, with a large contribution of filamentous algae typical of nutrient-rich systems, with shallow and calm waters. An indirect effect of the herbicide on the zooplankton was observed due to the increase in the abundance of the rotifer Lecane spp. as a consequence of the improved food availability given by picocyanobacteria and bacteria. The formulation affected directly a fraction of copepods as a target. It was concluded that the Glifosato Atanor(A (R)) accelerates the deterioration of the water quality, especially when considering small-volume water systems.",2012,21,1805,1816,10.1007/s10646-012-0915-2

Mortality was used as an endpoint for determining acute lethal effects, whereas the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay was employed as genotoxic endpoint to study sublethal effects. Lethality studies revealed LC50(96 h) values of 358.44 and 78.18 mg LC and GLY for Banvel(A (R)) and Credit(A (R)), respectively. SCGE assay revealed, after exposure for 96 h to either 5 and 10 % of the Banvel(A (R)) LC50(96 h) concentration or 5 and 10 % of the Credit(A (R)) LC50(96 h) concentration, an equal significant increase of the genetic damage index (GDI) regardless of the concentration of the herbicide assayed.

To this end, it has been treated embryo with 1, 5, 10 and 100 mg/L gyphosate at 96 h. The embryos treated with glyphosate from 4 hpf were evaluated by considering the survival rates, hatching rates, body malformations under the stereo microscope in 24, 48, 72 and 96th hours. In order to clarify the mechanism of the abnormalities ROS, enzyme activity of carbonic anhydrase and cellular death were detected end of the 96th hour. The data obtained in the present study have shown that glyphosate treatment inhibited CA activity, caused production of ROS especially branchial regions, triggered cellular apoptosis and caused several types of malformations including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, spinal curvature and body malformation in a dose-dependent manner. As a conclusion, in light of present and previous studies, we can deduce that (1) the probable reason of ROS production was CA inhibition via decreasing of CO2 extraction and developing respiratory acidosis (however, one needs to clarify), (2) abundance of ROS triggered cellular apoptosis and (3) as a result of cellular apoptosis malformations increased. These data will enable us to further understand potential toxic mechanism of glyphosate on embryonic development stage of zebrafish and may be useful for assessment in the toxicology studies.

Since glyphosate is highly water soluble it reaches water bodies easily in surface water runoff. This prompted us to undertake an experiment to evaluate the effects of glyphosate in Roundup(R) on natural communities of marine microphytobenthos. Microphytobenthos communities were obtained from the environment, and after transporting them to the laboratory and acclimatizing them, they were tested under controlled conditions. Changes in microphytobenthos composition and structure and the deteriorating condition of the cells of community-forming organisms (assessed by analyzing changes in chloroplast shape) were used to assess the impact of Roundup(R) on endpoints. The tests indicated that microphytobenthic communities were relatively resistant to herbicide. The species richness of the communities probably enabled them to rebuild effectively. Sensitive species were replaced by those more tolerant of glyphosate. Only at the highest glyphosate concentration (8.5 g center dot dm(-3)) tested was a strong negative effect noted that limited community abundance and eliminated some of the organisms.

"Székács, A; Darvas, B",Re-registration Challenges of Glyphosate in the European Union,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"One of the most controversial societal issues today, regarding pesticide registration in the European Union (EU) may be the case surrounding re-registration of the active herbicide ingredient glyphosate. Shortly before the announcement of the conflicting views regarding the carcinogenicity status of this regulated agrochemical by EU Agencies, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the one hand, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on the other hand, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) also published re-evaluations. The US EPA assessment classified glyphosate into Group E, not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Similar positions were reached by EFSA and ECHA, assessing glyphosate as unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and not classified as a carcinogen, respectively. A strongly opposing evaluation has previously been reached by IARC by classifying glyphosate into Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. IARC identified potential cancer hazards in this case, but did not estimate the level of risk it may present, which was taken into consideration by opposing agencies. Multiple effects of glyphosate have been reported, of which carcinogenic effects are only one component. Formulated glyphosate products-especially with polyethoxylated tallowamine and related compounds-have been shown to cause stronger cytotoxic or endocrine disrupting effects than the active ingredient glyphosate alone. Questions related to hazards and corresponding risks identified in relation to this active ingredient and its formulated herbicide preparations divide scientific circles and official health and environmental authorities and organizations, and touch upon fundamental aspects of risk assessment and product regulation. The decision has to consider both hazard-based (IARC) and risk-based analysis (EFSA); the former may not be suitable to calculate practical significances, and the latter being challenged if exposure estimations are uncertain in light of new data on residue levels. The results of current analytical surveys on surface water are particularly worrisome.

"Tartu, S; Renoirt, M; Cheron, M; Gisselmann, LL; Catoire, S; Brischoux, F",Did decades of glyphosate use have selected for resistant amphibians in agricultural habitats?,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are used worldwide, and glyphosate's primary metabolite (aminomethylphosphonic acid: AMPA), is globally retrieved in surface waters. AMPA induces various adverse effects on aquatic wildlife, including selective mortality, which suggests that glyphosate exposure may have selected for AMPA-resistant individuals. We tested this hypothesis using spined toads (Bufo spinosus), an amphibian found in a variety of habitats, from AMPA-exposed agricultural lands to AMPA-free forested areas. We predicted that the offspring of individuals originating from agricultural habitats would develop AMPA-resistance -and be less prone to develop adverse effects from-AMPA exposure. To investigate this question, we performed a common garden brood -rearing experiment. The embryos and larvae of 40 spined toad pairs captured in agricultural and forest ponds were exposed either to an environmental relevant concentration of AMPA (0.4 mu g L-1) or to control conditions (n = 8160 embryos, n = 240 tadpoles). We monitored development durations, developmental abnormalities and morphology, measured across key developmental stages. Although we observed significant effects of AMPA on fitness parameters in each group, these effects were not exacerbated in individuals from AMPA-free habitats. We suggest that temporal and/or spatial dynamics of contamination, as well as gene flow between exposed and preserved populations, may hinder adaptive divergence between populations.

Globally, the use of glyphosate is increasing, and its residues have been found in drinking water and food products. The data regarding the possible toxic effects of this herbicide are controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of glyphosate at environmental concentrations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 100, and 1,000 mu g/L glyphosate for 96 h, and mortality, heart rate, and hatching rate were evaluated. After the experiment, RNA was extracted from the embryos for transcriptional analysis. No mortality was recorded, and exposure to 100 mu g/L and 1,000 mu g/L of glyphosate resulted in lower heart rates at 48 h. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that glyphosate exposure induced subtle changes in gene transcription profiles. We found 30 differentially expressed genes; however, the highest glyphosate concentration (1,000 mu g/L) induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes involved in oocyte maturation, metabolic processes, histone deacetylation, and nervous system development.",2022,57,775,785,10.1080/03601234.2022.2115780
"Thoré, ESJ; Philippe, C; Brendonck, L; Pinceel, T",Towards improved fish tests in ecotoxicology - Efficient chronic and multi-generational testing with the killifish Nothobranchius furzeri,CHEMOSPHERE,"As many freshwaters are chemically polluted, one of the challenges for policy makers is to determine the potential impact of these pollutants on ecosystems and to define safe concentrations. Common practice is the use of ecotoxicological assays to assess the response of model organisms from different trophic levels such as algae, invertebrates and fish during exposure to dilutions of a specific compound. Ideally, ecotoxicological assessments of (pseudo-)persistent chemicals should be performed across the life-cycle or even multiple generations for an accurate risk assessment. Multigenerational tests with fish are, however, impractical and costly given the long lifespan and generation time of classic model species. Here, we suggest a framework for more relevant, time- and cost-efficient fish-based testing in ecotoxicology and align it with accredited test guidelines. Next, we introduce an upcoming fish model, the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri, and show how it facilitates such research agendas due to a short lifespan and generation time. Through a review of fish-based exposure studies with a set of reference toxicants, we position N. furzeri as a sensitive species, suitable for screening effects of different pollutant types. Ultimately, we perform a cost-benefit analysis and propose a plan of action for the introduction of N. furzeri into accredited test guidelines. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to their extensive application, they frequently occur in aquatic ecosystems and may affect various organisms. The active substance GLY and its major by-product, AMPA, are the most thoroughly studied chemicals; however, the adverse effects of the complex formulas of GBHs with diverse and unknown content of co-formulants are still not sufficiently researched. This study focused on the embryotoxicity, sublethal malformations, and estrogenic potency of GLY, AMPA, and four commonly used GBHs on zebrafish embryos using a wild type and an estrogen-sensitive, transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(vtg1:mCherry)).After 120 h of exposition, AMPA did not cause acute toxicity, while the LC50 of GLY was 160 mg/L. The GBHs were more toxic with LC50 values ranging from 31 to 111 GLY active equivalent (a.e.) mg/L. Exposure to 0.35-2.8 mg/L GBHs led to sublethal abnormalities: typical symptoms were structural deformation of the lower jaw and anomalies in the olfactory region. Deformity rates were 10-30% in the treated groups.In vivo, fluorescently expressed vtg1 mCherry protein in embryonic liver was detected by a non-invasive microscopic method indicating estrogenic action through vitellogenin production by GLY, AMPA, and GBHs. To confirm the in vivo findings, RT-qPCR method was performed to determine the levels of the estrogenicity-related vtg1 mRNA. After 120 h of exposure to GLY, AMPA, and three GBHs at a concentration of 0.35 mg/L, the expression of vtg1 gene was significantly up-regulated.

The nominal effective concentrations immobilizing 50% (EC50) of Daphnia after 24 and 48h were 0.53 and 0.36 mu g L-1, 0.70 and 0.44 mu g L-1, and 0.75 and 0.46 mu g L-1 for the strains 1, 2, and 3 respectively. There was an increase in malathion ecotoxicity with time of exposure as confirmed by chronic studies. In fact, after 21days of exposure, significant effects on survival (lowest observed effect concentration or LOECs) were recorded at malathion concentrations of 22, 220 and 230ng L-1 for strains 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Other endpoints were also examined, including reproduction (with different parameters), body length and embryo toxicity. ICs10 and ICs20 were calculated for these different parameters. ICs10 ranged from 4.7 to more than 220ng L-1 for the three tested strains. The most sensitive parameter was the number of neonates per adult (ICs10 = 4.7 and 10.8ng L-1 for strains 1 and 2 respectively) or the number of broods (IC10 = 10ng L-1 for strain 3). Moreover, an increase in embryo development abnormalities was observed at the two highest tested malathion concentrations. Abnormalities comprised undeveloped second antennae, curved or unextended shell spines, and curved post-abdomen spines in live neonates. Results suggest that malathion could act as an endocrine disruptor in D. magna as it interferes with development. It also induces a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities for the three strains. Both strains 2 and 3 seemed more sensitive (LOECs = 60ng L-1) than strain 1 (LOEC = 120ng L-1). Our results suggest that the AChE activity response can also be used as a biomarker of inter-strain (or inter-clonal) susceptibility (i.e. strain (or clone)-specific response).",2015,50,34,44,10.1080/03601234.2015.965617

In general, chemical control of weeds is considered to be an easy, relatively cheap, and highly effective method. However, not all weeds can be successfully controlled, either because of their natural tolerance or their herbicide resistance. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. It can manage effectively a broad spectrum of weeds, and promotes conservation agriculture by significantly reducing conventional plough tillage. Unfortunately, its extensive use has led to the evolution of glyphosate resistance, which has evolved into a major problem for global crop production. Alternative herbicides are, in some cases, available, but they do not usually control certain weeds as efficiently as glyphosate. The transmission of herbicides to the target site is a complex process, and consists of several stages. Each herbicide is affected and can be manipulated by the product formulation for the optimization of its use. Many experiments have confirmed that different glyphosate salts and adjuvant additives are instrumental in the optimization of herbicide absorption and delivery processes. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief overview of these experiments and summarize the literature related to the effect of various glyphosate formulations and adjuvants on weed control. Determining the differences among formulations and adjuvants may lead to the further optimized long-term use of glyphosate.",2017,7,,,10.3390/agronomy7030060

In this study, the acute toxicity of technical-grade glyphosate acid, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, Roundup((R)) and its surfactant polyoxyethylene amine (POEA) to Microtox((R)) bacterium (Vibrio fischeri), microalgae (Selenastrum capricornutum and Skeletonema costatum), protozoa (Tetrahymena pyriformis and Euplotes vannus) and crustaceans (Ceriodaphnia dubia and Acartia tonsa) was examined and the relative toxicity contributions of POEA to Roundup((R)) were calculated. The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox((R)) bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup((R)) toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l). In contrast, microalgae and crustaceans were 4-5 folds more sensitive to Roundup((R)) toxicity than bacteria and protozoa. Except photosynthetic microalgae, POEA accounted for more than 86% of Roundup((R)) toxicity and the toxicity contribution of POEA was shown to be species-dependent. Increase in pH (6-9) and increase of suspended sediment concentration (0-200 mg/l) significantly increased the toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia, but there were no significant effects due to temperature change and food addition.

In 2019 the European Commission approved the use of this herbicide for another 5 years and is now preparing its re-authorization for marketing. It is known that glyphosate (an active ingredient-AI) is usually less toxic than its commercial formulations, which may be related to adjuvants presents in such formulas. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of glyphosate, as the commercial formulation Roundup (R) Ready (RR), and the AI in the Hydra viridissima life cycle, namely: mortality, morphology, feeding, reproduction, and regeneration. To attain this goal, H. viridissima was exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate (5.2 mg AI/L, both for RR and the AI) and to its culture medium (control). The mortality was lower than 0.03% for both RR and AI. Regarding morphological alterations, these were more severe on organisms exposed to RR, while a high recovery capacity in hydras exposed to AI was observed. No hydra was able to completely regenerate its body parts when exposed to RR, while 95% of the organisms exposed to AI were able to regenerate completely. The feeding rates of hydras exposed to RR decreased by from similar to 20% to similar to 50% compared to AI. As for reproduction, hydras exposed to RR released similar to 70% less buds than those exposed to AI. These timely results suggest that adjuvants present in the commercial formulation of glyphosate may cause higher toxicity to biota than the AI at environmentally relevant concentrations. Though the commercial formulation exerted higher toxicity in hydra, the effects AI induced in the morphology of the hydra cannot be disregarded, suggesting that a deeper understanding on the long-term toxicity of this AI is still needed to further support the decision on its marketing authorization and environmentally safe use.",2023,15,,,10.3390/su151612428

The experiment was carried out over 42 days in ten outdoor mesocosms of different typology: clear waters with aquatic macrophytes and/or metaphyton and turbid waters with great occurrence of phytoplankton or suspended inorganic matter. The herbicide was added at 8 mg L-1 of the active ingredient (glyphosate) in five mesocosms while five were left as controls (without Roundup(A (R)) addition). The estimate of the dissipation rate (k) of glyphosate showed a half-life value of 4.2 days. Total phosphorus significantly increased in treated mesocosms due to Roundup(A (R)) degradation what favored eutrophication process. Roundup(A (R)) produced a clear delay in periphytic colonization in treated mesocosms and values of the periphytic mass variables (dry weight, ash-free dry weight and chlorophyll a) were always higher in control mesocosms. Despite the mortality of algae, mainly diatoms, cyanobacteria was favored in treated mesocosms. It was observed that glyphosate produced a long term shift in the typology of mesocosms, clear turning to turbid, which is consistent with the regional trend in shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina.

The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation.

In contrast to bacteria, few eukaryotic phytoplankton species appear capable of directly utilizing glyphosate. In this study, we observed, after a long delay (>60 days), Prorocentrum donghaiense, a dinoflagellate known to cause major harmful algal blooms in the East China Sea, could grow in a medium with glyphosate as the sole P source; suggesting that P. donghaiense growth was through bacterial mediation. To understand how the bacteria community might respond to glyphosate, we analyzed the 16S rRNA genes of the microbial community present in P. donghaiense cultures when grown under lower (36 mu M) and higher (360 mu M) glyphosate concentrations. Based on both Sanger and Illumina high throughput sequencing, we obtained more than 55,323 good-quality sequences, which were c mu lassified into six phyla. As the concentration of glyphosate rose, our results showed a significant increase in the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and a decrease in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Further qPCR (Quantitative PCR) analysis showed higher abundances of two specific phylotypes in the higher-glyphosate P. donghaiense cultures when compared to the lower-glyphosate and no-glyphosate cultures. Correspondingly, qPCR displayed the same trend for the abundance of a gammaproteobacterial type of phnJ, a gene encoding Alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate 5-phosphate C-P lyase, which is responsible for phosphonate degradation. In addition, Tax4Fun analysis based on our 16S rRNA gene sequences results in higher predicted abundances of phosphonate metabolizing genes in glyphosate-treated cultures. This study demonstrates that glyphosate could selectively promote the growth of particular groups of bacteria within an algal culture and in glyphosate enriched coastal waters, this interaction may potentially further facilitate the growth of alga.",2017,8,,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02530

We studied the physiological effects of glyphosate on fourteen species representing five major coastal phytoplankton phyla (haptophyta, bacillariophyta, dinoflagellata, raphidophyta, and chlorophyta). Based on growth responses to different concentrations of glyphosate under contrasting dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) conditions, we found that phytoplankton species could be classified into five groups. Group I (Emiliania huxleyi, Skeletonema costatum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum) could utilize glyphosate as sole P-source to support growth in axenic culture, but in the presence of DIP, they were inhibited by both 36-mu M and 360-mu M glyphosate. Group II (Karenia mikimotoi, Prorocentrum minimum, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Symbiodinium sp., Heterosigma akashiwo and Alexandrium catenella) could not utilize glyphosate as sole P-source to support growth, and in the presence of DIP growth was not affected by 36-mu M but inhibited by 360-mu M glyphosate. Glyphosate consistently enhanced growth of Group III (Isochrysis galbana) and inhibited Group IV (Thalassiosira weissflogii, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Chattonella marina) regardless of DIP condition. Group V (Amphidinium carterae) exhibited no measurable response to glyphosate regardless of DIP condition. This grouping is not congruent with the phylogenetic relationships of the phytoplankton species suggesting functional differentiation driven by environmental pressure. We conclude that glyphosate could be used as P-source by some species while is toxic to some other species and yet has no effects on others.

"Webster, TMU; Santos, EM",Global transcriptomic profiling demonstrates induction of oxidative stress and of compensatory cellular stress responses in brown trout exposed to glyphosate and Roundup,BMC GENOMICS,"Background: Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup formulations, is the most widely used herbicide worldwide, and as a result contaminates surface waters and has been detected in food residues, drinking water and human urine, raising concerns for potential environmental and human health impacts. Research has shown that glyphosate and Roundup can induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms, particularly via generation of oxidative stress. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation of the global molecular mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup for any species. We aimed to characterise and compare the global mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup in the liver of brown trout (Salmo trutta), an ecologically and economically important vertebrate species, using RNA-seq on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. To do this, we exposed juvenile female brown trout to 0, 0.01, 0.5 and 10 mg/L of glyphosate and Roundup (glyphosate acid equivalent) for 14 days, and sequenced 6 replicate liver samples from each treatment. Results: We assembled the brown trout transcriptome using an optimised de novo approach, and subsequent differential expression analysis identified a total of 1020 differentially-regulated transcripts across all treatments. These included transcripts encoding components of the antioxidant system, a number of stress-response proteins and pro-apoptotic signalling molecules. Functional analysis also revealed over-representation of pathways involved in regulating of cell-proliferation and turnover, and up-regulation of energy metabolism and other metabolic processes. Conclusions: These transcriptional changes are consistent with generation of oxidative stress and the widespread induction of compensatory cellular stress response pathways. The mechanisms of toxicity identified were similar across both glyphosate and Roundup treatments, including for environmentally relevant concentrations. The significant alterations in transcript expression observed at the lowest concentrations tested raises concerns for the potential toxicity of this herbicide to fish populations inhabiting contaminated rivers.",2015,16,,,10.1186/s12864-015-1254-5

To do this, we conducted a 21-day exposure of breeding zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.01, 0.5, and 10 mg/L (glyphosate acid equivalent) Roundup and 10 mg/L glyphosate. 10 mg/L glyphosate reduced egg production but not fertilization rate in breeding colonies. Both 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate increased early stage embryo mortalities and premature hatching. However, exposure during embryogenesis alone did not increase embryo mortality, suggesting that this effect Was caused primarily by exposure during gametogenesis. Transcript profiling of the gonads revealed 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate induced changes in the expression of cyp19a1 and esr1 in the ovary and hsd3b2, cat, and sod1 in the testis. Our results demonstrate that these chemicals cause reproductive toxicity in zebrafish, although only at high concentrations unlikely to occur in the environment, and likely mechanisms of toxicity include disruption of the steroidogenic biosynthesis pathway and oxidative stress.",2014,48,1271,1279,10.1021/es404258h

The effect of pre-harvest chemical desiccation on seed yield and quality was determined. In field experiments, on a fine, montmorillonitic mesic Aquic Arguidoll, Flanagan series soil, harvest was accelerated, but all chemicals significantly reduced yields when they were applied 3 and 4 wk before harvest. Yields were not significantly reduced by applications 2 wk before harvest. Paraquat was the most effective desiccant for accelerating soybean harvest. Paraquat also reduced yield and seed weight the most while glyphosate had the least effect. Ametryn and paraquat did not affect seed germination or seedling vigor, but all glyphosate applications significantly reduced germination and soybean seedling vigor. Chemical desiccation of soybeans prior to physiological maturity will significantly lower soybean yields.

"Wood, RJ; Mitrovic, SM; Lim, RP; Kefford, BJ",THE INFLUENCE OF REDUCED LIGHT INTENSITY ON THE RESPONSE OF BENTHIC DIATOMS TO HERBICIDE EXPOSURE,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Herbicide pollution events in aquatic ecosystems often coincide with increased turbidity and reduced light intensity. It is therefore important to determine whether reduced light intensity can influence herbicide toxicity, especially to primary producers such as benthic diatoms. Benthic diatoms collected from 4 rivers were exposed to herbicides in 48 h rapid toxicity tests under high light (100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and low light (20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) intensities. The effects of 2 herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) were assessed on 26 freshwater benthic diatom taxa. There was no significant interaction of light and herbicide effects at the community level or on the majority (22 of 26) of benthic diatom taxa. This indicates that low light levels will likely have only a minor influence on the response of benthic diatoms to herbicides. (C) 2016 SETAC",2016,35,2252,2260,10.1002/etc.3379

However, glyphosate can be transported into the aquatic environment and might cause adverse effects on aquatic life. This study investigated the physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) after exposure to glyphosate, and the results showed that changes in cell density production, chlorophyll a and protein content are consistent. In M. aeruginosa, oxidative stress caused by glyphosate indicated that 48 h of exposure increased the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD). To further investigate the toxicity of glyphosate on M. aeruginosa, the viability of treated cells was monitored and the toxin release was determined. The results indicated that glyphosate induced apoptosis of and triggered toxin release in M. aeruginosa. These results are helpful for understanding the toxic effects of glyphosate on cyanobacteria, which is important for environmental assessment and protection. These results are also useful for guidance on the application of this type of herbicide in agricultural settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, increasing intensive anthropogenic activities including the inputs of herbicide glyphosate disturb the breakdown of LL in streams. In this study, an anthropogenic carrion subsidy (chicken meat) and glyphosate (a stressor) were used to investigate their individual and combined effects on LL breakdown in urban streams and forest streams in China. We found that: 1) carrion subsidy decreased LL breakdown rate in both urban and forest streams and increased total and predator richness in forest streams, the reduced LL breakdown rates may be attributed to the foraging shift of macroinvertebrates from LL to carrion subsidy; 2) glyphosate depressed LL breakdown rate in forest but not in urban streams, the reduced LL breakdown rate may be caused by the negative effects on microbes; 3) forest streams showed significantly higher LL breakdown rates in both coarse and fine mesh bags than urban streams which were induced by the high dissolved oxygen (DO) and collector-gatherer richness. Our results provide evidence that LL breakdown in streams is sensitive to inputs of anthropogenic carrion subsidy and glyphosate through the impacts on macroinvertebrates and microbes, respectively. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of local macroinvertebrate and microbial communities when assessing the responses of stream ecosystem functioning and macroinvertebrate communities to multiple stressors, as the individual and combined effects of stressors can be site-specific in streams with different physical characteristics and biological communities.",2022,10,,,10.3389/fenvs.2022.806340
"Xiang, HY; Zhang, YX; Atkinson, D; Sekar, R",Effects of anthropogenic subsidy and glyphosate on macroinvertebrates in streams,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Streams and surrounding terrestrial ecosystems are closely linked by numerous resource subsidies including anthropogenic subsidies which are increasingly entering streams due to intensive human activities. Also, streams are threatened by stressors such as glyphosate-the most widely used herbicide worldwide. However, the ecological consequences of anthropogenic subsidies and glyphosate on freshwaters are not fully understood. Here, we deployed leaf litter (Cinnamomum camphora) bags containing neither, either, or both treatments of anthropogenic carrion subsidy (chicken meat) and glyphosate (coated in agar) in four streams, which had different land use (i.e., forest, village, and suburban) in Huangshan, Anhui Province, China. We aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of anthropogenic carrion subsidy and glyphosate on macroinvertebrates in streams and whether these effects differ with land use change. Macroinvertebrate communities significantly differed among streams: biodiversity index and total taxon richness were highest in village streams and lowest in suburban stream. Overall effects of carrion subsidy and glyphosate on macroinvertebrates were not significant. However, several taxa were affected in one or more streams by the individual or combined effects of carrion subsidy and glyphosate, indicating the importance of local community structure and physical habitats in driving the response of macroinvertebrates to carrion subsidy and glyphosate. Collectively, these results imply that the effects of carrion subsidy and glyphosate on macroinvertebrates are site-specific, and future studies should cover more streams and last longer time to better understand the ecological mechanisms driving such pattern.",2020,27,21939,21952,10.1007/s11356-020-08505-w

Our results showed that glyphosate induced acute toxicity to the snail only at high concentrations (96 h LC50 at 175 mg/L) unlikely to occur in the environment. Long-term exposures to glyphosate at sublethal levels (20 and 120 mg/L) caused inhibition of food intake, limitation of growth performance and alterations in metabolic profiles of the snail, It is worth noting that glyphosate at 2 mg/L benefited growth performance in P. canaliculata. Chronic exposures of glyphosate significantly enhanced overall metabolic rate and altered catabolism from protein to carbohydrate/lipid mode. Cellular responses in enzyme activities showed that the exposed snails could increase tolerance by their defense system against glyphosate-induced oxidative stress, and adjustment of metabolism to mitigate energy crisis. Our study displayed that sublethal concentrations of glyphosate might be helpful in control of the invasive species by food intake, growth performance and metabolic interruption; whether environmental relevance of glyphosate (<= 2 mg/L) benefits population growth of P. canaliculata is still inconclusive, which requires further field study.",2017,193,136,143,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.011

However, the impact of glyphosate on non-target organisms, especially on amphibians, is the subject of major concern and debate in recent times. We examined the toxic and genotoxic effects of Roundup, a commercial formulation of glyphosate, in the tadpoles of the Indian skittering frog (Euflictis cyanophlyctis). Roundup at different concentrations (0, 1, 2,3, 4 and 8 mg acid equivalent (ae)/L), tested in a 2 x 6 factorial design in the presence and absence of predator stress, induced concentration-dependent lethality in tadpoles. The 96-h LC50 for Roundup in the absence and presence of predator stress were 3.76 mg ae/L and 3.39 mg ae/L, respectively. The 10-day LC50 value for Roundup was significantly lower, 2.12 mg ae/L and 1.91 mg ae/L in the absence and presence of predator stress, respectively. Lower concentrations of Roundup (1,2 and 3 mg ae/L) induced the formation of micronuclei (MN) in the erythrocytes of tadpoles at 24-h (F-3,F-56 = 10.286, p < 0.001), 48-h (F-3,F-56 = 48.255, p < 0.001), 72-h (F-3,F-56 = 118.933, p < 0.001) and 96-h (F-3,F-56 = 85.414, p < 0.001) in a concentration-dependent manner. Presence of predator stress apparently increased the toxicity and genotoxicity of Roundup; but these effects were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that Roundup at environmentally relevant concentrations has lethal and genotoxic impact on E. cyanophlyctis; which may have long-term fitness consequence to the species.

In this study, the toxic effects of glyphosate suspension (Glyphosate Aria 41% SL, Tehran Iran) on behavior and tissues of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were assessed. For this purpose, a 96 h LC50 of glyphosate suspension (68.788 mL & BULL;L-1) was used in the toxicity test. All individuals were divided into control and treatment groups with four replicates. Exposure operations were performed under two conditions: increasing concentration of suspension from 0 to 68.788 mL & BULL;L-1; then, decreasing to the first level. The swimming pattern was recorded by digital cameras during the test and tissue samples were collected at the end of the test. There were significant differences between the swimming pattern of treated individuals and control ones during both steps. The sublethal concentration of glyphosate led to hypertrophy, hyperplasia and hyperemia in the gill of fish. However, changes were obvious only after sampling. The exposed fish also displayed clinical signs such as darkening of the skin and increasing movement of the operculum. Moreover, glyphosate suspension affected swimming patterns of fish suggest that the swimming behavior test can indicate the potential toxicity of environmental pollutants and be used as a noninvasive, useful method for managing environmental changes and assessing fish health conditions by video monitoring.",2021,8,,,10.3390/vetsci8100218

In this study, testes morphology, physiology function, apoptosis pathway, and spermatozoa quality of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) were evaluated after 7 days of GBH exposure (48.945 mg/l,1/2 of the 96 h LC50 value of GBH). Results showed that GBH induced spermatogenesis disorder by H.E. staining. The obvious vacuolar degenerations and fewer spermatids of the testes accompanied by decreased primary spermatocytes-type seminiferous tubules (PSc-STs) were observed. The extensive apoptosis of spermatids by TUNEL staining was visible. Meanwhile, testes'' characteristic enzyme activities associated with spermatogenesis, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and acid phosphatase (ACP) were significantly decreased. Testes suffered oxidative damage as reflected by the significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, the significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and heat shock proteins (HSP-70) mRNA expression. Further studies demonstrated that GBH induced apoptosis of testes through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by upregulating the relative mRNA expression of cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase-3), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and downregulating B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Oxidative damage may be one of the causes of GBH-induced apoptosis in testes. After GBH exposure, the morphology of spermatophores was changed. The survival and the acrosome reaction (AR) ratio of spermatozoa was significantly decreased. Altogether, these results demonstrated that GBH affects spermatogenesis, spermatophore and spermatozoa quality of E.sinensis, which provides novel knowledge about the toxic effects of GBH on the reproductive system of crustaceans.",2022,447,,,10.1016/j.taap.2022.116086

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.",2021,33,,,10.1186/s12302-021-00492-0

However, the potential mechanisms of CPF and GLY to induce toxicity have not been fully explored. To identify the adverse impacts of CPF and GLY on fish, either alone or in combination (MIX), CPF (25 mu g/L) and GLY (3.5 mg/L) were set up according to an environmentally relevant concentration to expose to common carp for 21 days. After exposure, CPF and GLY decreased the activities of acetylcholinesterase and Na+/K+-ATPase, altered monoamine oxidase levels, decreased antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutamic reductase), and induced the accumulation of malondialdehyde in the carp brain. The parameters in the MIX groups had a greater impact compared to that in the CPF or GLY group, suggesting that both single and combined exposure could affect neurological signaling systems and cause oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation damage in carp brains, and that MIX exposure increases the impact of each pollutant. RNA-seq results showed that single or combined exposure to CPF and GLY induced global transcriptomic changes in fish brains, and the number of differentially expressed genes in MIX-treated carp brains were globally increased compared to either the CPF or GLY groups, suggesting that the effects of co-exposure were greater than single exposure. Further analysis results revealed that the global transcriptomic changes participated in oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and apoptosis of fish brains, and identified that the P13k-Akt signaling pathway participates in both single and combined exposure of CPF- and GLY-induced toxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the interaction of CPF and GLY might be synergic and provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of fish brains coping with CPF and GLY.",2023,24,,,10.3390/ijms241612934

NPs not only directly affect aquatic organisms but also adsorb other pollutants, causing combined pollution. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and is commonly monitored in freshwater systems. In this study, the effects of the combined toxicity of polystyrene cationic amino-modified nanoparticles (nPS-NH2) and glyphosate on a blue-green alga, Microcystis aeruginosa, were investigated. Our results demonstrated that 5 mg/L glyphosate had a strong inhibitory effect on M. aeruginosa (the 96-h inhibitory rate was 27%), while 5 mg/L nPS-NH2 had no apparent effect on the growth of M. aeruginosa. Interestingly, nPS-NH2 combined with glyphosate showed antagonistic effects on the inhibition of algal growth because nPS-NH2 displayed a strong adsorption capacity for glyphosate, which significantly alleviated the inhibitory effect of glyphosate on M. aeruginosa growth. However, the presence of glyphosate enhanced the stability of the dispersion system, which allowed more nPS-NH2 to adsorb on the surface of M. aeruginosa and may result in greater enrichment of nPS-NH2 in the food chain to show potential repercussions to human life. Our current study provides a new theoretical basis for the combined effects of NPs and pesticide pollution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of long-term and large-scale use, residual GLY and AMPA in the environment pose great environmental and human health threats. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and mechanism of residual low-concentrations of GLY and AMPA in the environment on the development of zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 10, 100, and 700 ng.mL- 1 GLY and AMPA for 72 h (from 2 to 74 h post-fertilization). With increasing exposure dose, heart rates of both embryos and larvae showed a rising trend and obvious arrhythmia appeared. Defects in cardiac development and function of zebrafish juveniles may be related to altered transcription levels of cardiac development genes (TBX5, NKX2.5, BMP4) and apoptosis genes (Bcl-2, Bax). In addition, pericardial edema and bone deformation of zebrafish embryos may be caused by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase after exposure to GLY and AMPA.

"Zocchi, M; Sommaruga, R",Microplastics modify the toxicity of glyphosate on Daphnia magna,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Plastic contamination is an environmental problem spreading to even the most remote aquatic and terrestrial habitats and in particular, microplastics represent an uncertain threat for organisms. Microplastics can have a direct negative effect, but they can also potentially modify the toxicity and bioavailability of pollutants. Here, we tested over 1 week the combined effect of three different glyphosate chemical formulations (glyphosate acid, glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt, and Roundup Gran) and two types of microplastics (polyethylene (PE) microbeads and polyethylene terephthalate/polyamide (PET/PA) fibers), on Daphnia magna. Glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt caused the highest mortality after 1 week exposure (23.3%), whereas glyphosate acid the lowest (12.5%), when tested in the absence of microplastics. These results were inverted, however, when the individuals were exposed in combination with the PE microbeads (glyphosate acid: 53.3% and glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt: 18.3%) or the PET/PA fibers (glyphosate acid: 30.0% and glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt: 8.3%). The mortality in the Roundup Gran formulation also increased when combined with the two microplastics, though the effect was less pronounced. In all experiments, the effect of the treatments and time was significant, though there was no significant interaction between them. Inmost treatments, negative effects were not observed after 48 h or later. The change in toxicity of the glyphosate formulations caused by microplastics can be linked to the different sorption properties of the glyphosate-based chemicals formulations. The outcome of this study highlights that beside the potential direct negative effects of microplastics, they can modify the toxicity of pollutants, such as herbicides. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
