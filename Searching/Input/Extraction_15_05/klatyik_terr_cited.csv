Benbrook C.M.,Hypothesis: glyphosate-based herbicides can increase risk of hematopoietic malignancies through extended persistence in bone,2025,Environmental Sciences Europe,37,,,10.1186/s12302-025-01057-1,"Despite episodic and variable patterns of exposure, the levels of glyphosate (GLY) detected in the urine of herbicide applicators and the general public are relatively stable across space (urban vs. rural) and time (weed spray season, not spray season). Substantial GLY metabolism data show that within minutes of entering the bloodstream, GLY moves into bone marrow, and then laterally through bone tissue and back into general circulation. As GLY moves through bone it comes into contact with calcium and a portion is immobilized via chelation. A novel two-part hypothesis is explored: first, the likely reason for the lack of variability in GLY levels in urine is that GLY stored in bone is excreted gradually over days to weeks, and augments the generally stable and modest levels of dietary exposure to GLY; and second, the prolonged systemic movement of GLY into bone marrow and bone extends contact between GLY and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), increasing the risk of GLY-induced breaks and rearrangements in the DNA in HSCs. Studies confirm that GLY and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) can trigger oxidative stress and impair DNA-repair mechanisms. Animal bioassays and epidemiology studies link GLY/GBH exposures to heightened risk of blood cancers, and possibly other pathologies. The hypothesis proposed here provides a plausible pathophysiologic basis for these observations relative, in particular, to blood cancers. © The Author(s) 2025."

This study applies the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank plastics based on their environmental, economic, and social impacts, identifying polycarbonate (PC) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as the most problematic. The AHP framework provides a methodologically sound basis for prioritizing these plastics in waste management strategies, enabling more targeted policy interventions, lifecycle analyses, and corporate decisionmaking. Additionally, the findings can inform public awareness campaigns and guide efforts toward sustainable consumption and waste reduction. By focusing on the most impactful plastics, this research offers a strategic pathway for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of global plastic waste management.  © 2024 IEEE."
Furtak A.; Szafranek-Nakonieczna A.; Furtak K.; Pytlak A.,"A review of organophosphonates, their natural and anthropogenic sources, environmental fate and impact on microbial greenhouse gases emissions – Identifying knowledge gaps",2024,Journal of Environmental Management,355,,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120453,"Organophosphonates (OPs) are a unique group of natural and synthetic compounds, characterised by the presence of a stable, hard-to-cleave bond between the carbon and phosphorus atoms. OPs exhibit high resistance to abiotic degradation, excellent chelating properties and high biological activity. Despite the huge and increasing scale of OP production and use worldwide, little is known about their transportation and fate in the environment. Available data are dominated by information concerning the most recognised organophosphonate – the herbicide glyphosate - while other OPs have received little attention. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge about natural and artificial OPs is presented (including glyphosate). Based on the available literature, a number of knowledge gaps have been identified that need to be filled in order to understand the environmental effects of these abundant compounds. Special attention has been given to GHG-related processes, with a particular focus on CH4. This stems from the recent discovery of OP-dependent CH4 production in aqueous environments under aerobic conditions. The process has changed the perception of the biogeochemical cycle of CH4, since it was previously thought that biological methane formation was only possible under anaerobic conditions. However, there is a lack of knowledge on whether OP-associated methane is also formed in soils. Moreover, it remains unclear whether anthropogenic OPs affect the CH4 cycle, a concern of significant importance in the context of the increasing rate of global warming. The literature examined in this review also calls for additional research into the date of OPs in waste and sewage and in their impact on environmental microbiomes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The presence and levels of 209 pesticide residues (active substances and transformation products) in 625 environmental samples (201 soil, 193 crop, 20 outdoor air, 115 indoor dust, 58 surface water, and 38 sediment samples) have been studied. The samples were collected during the 2021 growing season, across 10 study sites, covering the main European crops, and conventional and organic farming systems. We profiled the pesticide residues found in the different matrices using existing hazard classifications towards non-target organisms and humans. Combining monitoring data and hazard information, we developed an indicator for the prioritization of pesticides, which can support policy decisions and sustainable pesticide use transitions. Eighty-six percent of the samples had at least one residue above the respective limit of detection. One hundred residues were found in soil, 112 in water, 99 in sediments, 78 in crops, 76 in outdoor air, and 197 in indoor dust. The number, levels, and profile of residues varied between farming systems. Our results show that non-approved compounds still represent a significant part of environmental cocktails and should be accounted for in monitoring programs and risk assessments. The hazard profiles analysis confirms the dominance of compounds of low-moderate hazard and underscores the high hazard of some approved compounds and recurring “no data available” situations. Overall, our results support the idea that risk should be assessed in a mixture context, taking environmentally relevant mixtures into consideration. We have uncovered uncertainties and data gaps that should be addressed, as well as the policy implications at the EU approval status level. Our newly introduced indicator can help identify research priority areas, and act as a reference for targeted scenarios set forth in the Farm to Fork pesticide reduction goals. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Despite their advantages in crop production and disease management, the use of pesticides poses significant hazards to the environment and public health. Pesticide elements have now perpetually entered our atmosphere and subsequently contaminated water, food, and soil, leading to health threats ranging from acute to chronic toxicities. Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The toxicity of a pesticide formulation may depend on the specific active ingredient and the presence of synergistic or inert compounds that can enhance or modify its toxicity. Safety concerns are the need of the hour to control contemporary pesticide-induced health hazards. The effectiveness and implementation of the current legislature in providing ample protection for human health and the environment are key concerns. This review explored a comprehensive summary of pesticides regarding their updated impacts on human health and advanced safety concerns with legislation. Implementing regulations, proper training, and education can help mitigate the negative impacts of pesticide use and promote safer and more sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors"
Evalen P.S.; Barnhardt E.N.; Ryu J.; Stahlschmidt Z.R.,Toxicity of glyphosate to animals: A meta-analytical approach,2024,Environmental Pollution,347,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123669,"Glyphosate (GLY)-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most commonly applied pesticide worldwide, and non-target organisms (e.g., animals) are now regularly exposed to GLY and GBHs due to the accumulation of these chemicals in many environments. Although GLY/GBH was previously considered to be non-toxic, growing evidence indicates that GLY/GBH negatively affects some animal taxa. However, there has been no systematic analysis quantifying its toxicity to animals. Therefore, we used a meta-analytical approach to determine whether there is a demonstrable effect of GLY/GBH toxicity across animals. We further addressed whether the effects of GLY/GBH vary due to (1) taxon (invertebrate vs. vertebrate), (2) habitat (aquatic vs. terrestrial), (3) type of biological response (behavior vs. physiology vs. survival), and (4) dosage or concentration of GLY/GBH. Using this approach, we also determined whether adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) in commercial formulations of GBHs increased toxicity for animals relative to exposure to GLY alone. We analyzed 1282 observations from 121 articles. We conclude that GLY is generally sub-lethally toxic for animals, particularly for animals in aquatic or marine habitats, and that toxicity did not exhibit dose-dependency. Yet, our analyses detected evidence for widespread publication bias so we encourage continued experimental investigations to better understand factors influencing GLY/GBH toxicity to animals. © 2024 The Authors"

This study investigated whether pesticide active substances (AS) approved for conventional agriculture in Europe differ in their ecotoxicity from AS approved for organic agriculture. The evaluation was based on official ecotoxicological data for surrogate honeybee, bird, and earthworm species, which also serve as a reference for official environmental risk assessments in the pesticide authorization process. In October 2022, 268 chemical-synthetic AS approved for conventional and 179 nature-based AS approved for organic agriculture were listed in the EU Pesticide Database. Ecotoxicological data were only available for 254 AS approved for use in conventional agriculture and 110 AS approved for use in organic agriculture. The results showed a higher ecotoxicity of conventional AS: 79% (201 AS), 64% (163 AS) and 91% (230 AS) were moderately to acutely toxic to honeybees, birds, and earthworms, respectively, compared to 44% (48 AS), 14% (15 AS) and 36% (39 AS) of AS approved for organic agriculture. We have only considered the potential ecotoxicities of individual substances in this assessment; actual exposure in the field, where multiple AS formulations with other chemicals (including impurities) are applied, will be different. Nevertheless, these results emphasize that an increase in organic agriculture in Europe would reduce the ecotoxicological burden on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. © 2024 by the authors."
Gutierrez A.P.; Kenmore P.E.; Ponti L.,Hybrid Bt cotton is failing in India: cautions for Africa,2023,Environmental Sciences Europe,35,,,10.1186/s12302-023-00804-6,"This paper reviews the ongoing failure of hybrid transgenic Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton unique to India. The underlying cause for this failure is the high cost of hybrid seed that imposes a suboptimal long-season low plant density system that limits yield potential and has associated elevated levels of late-season pests. Indian hybrid Bt cotton production is further complicated by the development of resistance to Bt toxins in the key pest, the native pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders, PBW), resulting in increased insecticide use that induces ecological disruption and outbreaks of highly destructive secondary pests. Rainfed cotton production uncertainty is further exacerbated by the variable monsoon rains. While hybrid cotton produces fertile seed, the resulting plant phenotypes are highly variable preventing farmers from replanting saved seed, forcing them to buy seed yearly (i.e., market capture), and effectively protecting industry Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). The lessons gained from the ongoing market failure of hybrid Bt cotton in India are of utmost importance to its proposed introduction to Africa where, similar to India, cotton is grown mainly in poor rainfed smallholder family farms, and hence similar private–corporate conflicts of interest will occur. Holistic field agroecological studies and weather-driven mechanistic analyses are suggested to help foresee ecological and economic challenges in cotton production in Africa. High-density short-season (HD-SS) non-hybrid non-genetically modified irrigated and rainfed cottons are viable alternatives for India that can potentially produce double the yields of the current low-density hybrid system. © 2023, The Author(s)."
Hasan F.; Perveen K.; Bukhari N.A.; Khan A.; Mani N.; Tanwar A.K.; Dhillon M.K.; Singh A.; Kumar A.; Sharma K.,Multigenerational hormetic effects of different insecticides on Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),2025,Crop Protection,187,,,10.1016/j.cropro.2024.106962,"To protect crops from pest insects, farmers continuously use insecticides, which eventually degrade into residue due to abiotic or biotic factors. These residual effects of pesticides may cause low lethal and/or sublethal impacts on the exposed pest insect populations, leading to the induction of pest resurgence through hormesis and ultimately the development of resistance. Hormesis is a beneficial bi-phasic effect generally characterized by low-dose reproductive stimulation and high-dose inhibition. In the present study, we investigated the impact of low lethal and sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of spinetoram, chlorantraniliprole, and thiodicarb on the F0 generation as well as their multigenerational hormesis effects on the F1 and F2 generations of Fall Armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The study focused on reproductive parameters, fecundity, fertility, and life index parameters such as net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (rm), finite rate of increase (λ), mean length of generation (Tc), and gross reproductive rate (GRR). Fecundity of S. frugiperda increased by 4.82%, 4.63% and 4.58%, while eggs fertility improved by 7.77%, 6.78% and 6.52% at LC10 of thiodicarb, chlorantraniliprole and spinetoram, respectively, from the F1 to F2 generation. Further, interaction analysis (Concentration × Insecticidal treatments) revealed that important vital parameters like pre-oviposition period (POP), oviposition period (OP), post-oviposition period (PtOP), R0, rm, λ, Tc and GRR of F0 were negatively impacted by LC30 of all the tested insecticides and LC20 of only spinetoram. However, LC10 of any of the tested insecticides did not affect these parameters when compared with control. Furthermore, interactive analysis in multigenerational exposure experiments (Concentration × Insecticidal treatments × Generation(s)) showed hermetic effects of LC10 of all tested insecticides which is more positive in F2 as compared to F1 generation. These unwanted positive hermetic effects of low lethal concentrations (LC10) of tested insecticides in offspring of exposed parental population of S. frugiperda indicated its resistance and/or resurgence. Furthernore, present study emphasizes the necessity for additional research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are widely and frequently applied to diminish weeds, exposing spiders a disturbed habitat, especially to overwintering spiders. We conducted a study combining field surveys and lab assays, to assess the effects of a GBH on the overwintering of the agrobiont wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata. The GBH significantly reduced the overall overwintering spider population by about 69 %, and reduced the number of vulnerable juveniles by about 80 %. The survivors exhibited substantial fitness costs such as reproductive dysfunctions and enhanced oxidative stress responses. We then mimicked the overwinter process in lab. We housed spiders on soil patches with and without weeds to examine whether weeds contributed to the GBH's sublethal effects. Spiders overwintered independent of weeds when GBH was not applied. When GBH was applied before or during overwintering, juvenile spiders overwintered in weedy habitats exhibited reduced survival and fecundity, and increased oxidative stress compared to their counterparts in weed-free habitats. Therefore, GBH-containing weeds contributed to the persistent adverse effects of GBH on overwintering spiders. The findings revealed the cross-talk among weeds, herbicides, low temperature, and non-target organisms. The study provides novel information on the environmental risk assessment of pesticides and rational scheduling of pesticide application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

We investigated whether pesticide active ingredients (AIs) are still present in ornamentals at the time of purchase and assessed their potential ecotoxicity to non-target organisms. We purchased 1000 pot plants and 237 cut flowers of different species from garden centers in Austria and Germany between 2011 and 2021 and analyzed them for up to 646 AIs. Ecotoxicological risks of AIs were assessed by calculating toxic loads for honeybees (Apis mellifera), earthworms (Eisenia fetida), birds (Passer domesticus), and mammals (Rattus norvegicus) based on the LD50 values of the detected AIs. Human health risks of AIs were assessed on the basis of the hazard statements of the Globally Harmonized System. Over the years, a total of 202 AIs were detected in pot plants and 128 AIs in cut flowers. Pesticide residues were found in 94% of pot plants and 97% of cut flowers, with cut flowers containing about twice as many AIs (11.0 ± 6.2 AIs) as pot plants (5.8 ± 4.0 AIs). Fungicides and insecticides were found most frequently. The ecotoxicity assessment showed that 47% of the AIs in pot plants and 63% of the AIs in cut flowers were moderately toxic to the considered non-target organisms. AIs found were mainly toxic to honeybees; their toxicity to earthworms, birds, and mammals was about 105 times lower. Remarkably, 39% of the plants labeled as “bee-friendly” contained AIs that were toxic to bees. More than 40% of pot plants and 72% of cut flowers contained AIs classified as harmful to human health. These results suggest that ornamental plants are vectors for potential pesticide exposure of consumers and non-target organisms in home gardens. © The Author(s) 2024."
Laber L.; Donath T.W.; Junck J.; Düring R.-A.; Eichberg C.,Competition moderates impact of anthelmintic-contaminated soil on growth and fitness of temperate grassland species,2025,Science of the Total Environment,968,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.178786,"In animal husbandry, the macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic moxidectin is commonly used and may accumulate in pasture soils, potentially impacting plant growth and fitness. To investigate these effects while considering plant competition, we conducted a completely randomised pot experiment. We grew four temperate grassland species – Achillea ptarmica, Agrostis capillaris, Dianthus deltoides, and Plantago lanceolata – separately in pots, with soil treated with formulated moxidectin at three concentration levels (0.1, 1, 5 μg g−1) or left untreated (control). In half of the pots, we added the dominant grass species Poa pratensis as a competitor. Over a full growth period in a greenhouse, we measured three morphological traits: above-ground plant biomass (APB), specific leaf area (SLA), and intact leaf area (ILA). Moxidectin concentrations in the above-ground plant parts and soil were analysed using HPLC. Results showed that moxidectin was absorbed by the roots and transported to the above-ground plant parts. At the highest concentration (5 μg g−1), APB and ILA were reduced by 14.4 % and 19.8 %, respectively, compared to controls, while SLA increased by 12.2 %. Anthelmintic effects varied with competition; for APB, significant effects were noted only in the absence of competition for three out of four species. The highest increases in SLA and reductions in ILA at 5 μg g−1 occurred without competition in one and three species, respectively. These findings suggest that soil contamination by anthelmintic residues can negatively affect the growth and fitness of grassland plants, particularly in low-competition areas, such as open soil patches, which serve as protective microsites for plant recruitment. © 2025 The Authors"

Therefore, this study evaluated the dissipation of two co-formulants, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid and 1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone, in courgette and tangerine samples to determine possible harmful metabolites under laboratory conditions. The analyses of these substances were performed by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). For the degradation of both compounds, a single-phase kinetic model was fitted, with R2 values greater than 0.99. In courgette and tangerine, half-lives (DT50) for dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid were 1.83 and 1.42 days, while DT50 was 6.26 and 5.04 days for 1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone, respectively. Three metabolites of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid and five metabolites of 1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone were found in courgette, while the same metabolites were detected in tangerine samples, except benzoic acid and 4-aminobutanoic acid. These metabolites were identified for the first time from these compounds except for benzoic acid, observing that 5-hydroxy-N-ethylpyrrolidone was the most concentrated metabolite in tangerine 14 days after application, reaching a maximum concentration of 149 µg/kg. Furthermore, some of the detected metabolites possessed a value of LD50 lower than their original molecules. In consequence, such metabolites, derived from these co-formulants, should be controlled to prevent negative health effects, and ensure food safety. © 2024 The Authors"

Wadi Guenniche is a tributary of the Bizerte coastal lagoon, with a watershed area of 86 km2, which exhibits pluvial cereal, legume, and orchid cultivation and irrigated market gardening. Twenty-nine pesticide active ingredients and 2 metabolites were detected in water. Twenty-four pesticide active ingredients were authorized for use in Tunisia. Among them, 14 had never been mentioned in previous farmer surveys. Five herbicides and their metabolites were the most frequently detected: aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) (100%), glyphosate (94%), simazine (94%), 2,4-D (70%), and deisopropylatrazine (DIA) (47%). The detection frequency and concentration range suggested that the phytosanitary pressure and resulting water contamination are close to those on the northern Mediterranean shore. These results, in addition to characterizing the pollution state, emphasized the need for additional studies on the use and fate of pesticides on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in Tunisia. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Thus, we aimed at the toxicity and histopathological alterations in the earthworm Eudrilus euginae following exposure to glyphosate (weedicide), urea (fertilizer), and environmentally friendly dual herb-mixed silver nanoparticles (DHM-AgNPs). The DHM-AgNPs were synthesized using a blend of Alfinia officinarum and Curcuma longa aqueous leaf extracts with 1 mM silver nitrate. The color change from yellow to brown after an hour of incubation was a significant indicator of successful DHM-AgNP synthesis. Characterization of the DHM-AgNPs using UV–Vis spectra indicated a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 430 nm. In addition to FT-IR spectroscopy and XRD analysis, SEM, TEM, and SEM investigations were performed to identify the DHM-AgNPs. The XPS analysis revealed the oxidation state and surface chemical composition, and Ag NP's specific surface area and degree of porosity were measured using BET. Furthermore, different concentrations of urea and glyphosate were administered to Artemia nauplii and E. euginae to assess their toxicity. The mortality rate for E. euginae exposed to a higher urea concentration (10 g/kg of soil) was 100%. In contrast, a % mortality rate of 83% was noted at 0.5 g/kg of soil. The maximum mortality (90 ± 0.64%) was observed at a 10 mL/kg/L concentration for glyphosate. In contrast, low mortality was noted in E. euginae and A. nauplii exposed with gradient concentrations of DHM-AgNPs compared to glyphosate and urea. As aquaculture and foodborne diseases are widespread, DHM-AgNPs showed significant anti-Vibrio activity against pathogenic Vibrio-related bacteria, inhibiting 80% at 100,100 μg/L, which is of great concern. This study suggests the potential use of DHM-AgNPs in field aqua and crops culture for eco-friendly pest control and anti-Vibrio activity without causing soil and environmental pollution. Further research is warranted to determine the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of DHM-AgNPs in aqua and agricultural practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Using the commercial pesticide preparations containing glyphosate, it was shown that the degree of inhibition of the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc largely depends on the formulants rather than on the active ingredient in their composition. Moreover, the combined inhibitory effect of the pesticides mixture on the coupled enzyme system Red + Luc was not additive. According to the results of the inhibitory assay, the type of interaction of pesticide preparations in mixtures depends on both the formulants used and the ratio of pesticides in the mixture. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025."

Globally, more than 2000 commercial GLY-based herbicides (GBHs) are used to control weeds. Non-target organisms are exposed to complex pesticide formulations under real environmental conditions, but the co-formulants contained in GBHs are classified as so-called inert and inactive ingredients in terms of their biological effects. The main objective of this comprehensive review is to compile the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies on the side-effects of GLY, GBHs, and their formulating agents. Based on the results demonstrated for a variety of plant and animal aquatic organisms, oxidative stress appears to be a major trigger for these adverse effects, affecting the integrity of DNA and other biochemical functions. Furthermore, there is evidence of impairment of various physiological and behavioral functions. Adverse effects of GLY and GBHs have been observed even at very low concentrations. There are also differences in the sensitivity of the aquatic organisms tested, even with similar lifestyles, habitats or identical taxa. The studies typically investigate the short-term effects of a single exposure to GLY/GBH on a single species, whilst in reality multiple applications of GBHs together with other pesticides are common during a cropping cycle. Moreover, the interactions between GLY/GBHs and other aquatic contaminants are rarely studied. Higher toxicity of GBHs compared to GLY alone has often been observed, demonstrating that co-formulants can be highly toxic on their own and markedly increase the toxicity of the GBH formulation. The possible impurities in GBHs, such as heavy metals, can cause additional problems for the environment and food safety. The widespread and massive use of GBHs leads to increased exposure and environmental hazards. In addition, the need for a revision of the risk assessment system is emphasized. According to the results of aquatic ecotoxicological studies, the current use and pollution of the aquatic environment by GLY/GBHs is highly problematic and cannot be considered environmentally sustainable. It is, therefore, necessary to at least tighten the permitted forms of use. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, we know little about how the effects of glyphosate AIs differ from those of GBHs that also contain so-called inert co-formulants. We conducted a greenhouse experiment using the model cover crop white mustard (Sinapis alba) to investigate the effects of three GBHs (Roundup PowerFlex, Roundup LB Plus, and Touchdown Quattro) and their respective glyphosate AIs (glyphosate potassium, isopropylamine, and diammonium salt) on epedaphic springtails (Sminthurinus niger; Collembola) activity in soils with low (3.0%) or high (4.1%) organic matter content (SOM). Springtail activity was assessed using pitfall traps. Most GBHs and AIs reduced springtail activity compared to mechanical removal of mustard in the short-term and even up to 5 months after application. GBHs and AIs differed considerably in their effects on springtail activity, and effects were modified by SOM content. Our results highlight the need to (i) distinguish between the effects of glyphosate AIs and commercial GBH formulations, (ii) disclose all ingredients of GBHs, as co-formulants also affect non-target organisms, and (iii) include soil properties in ecotoxicological risk assessments for soil organisms to better characterize the situation in the field. © 2023 by the authors."
Bartling M.-T.; Brandt A.; Hollert H.; Vilcinskas A.,Current Insights into Sublethal Effects of Pesticides on Insects,2024,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,25,,,10.3390/ijms25116007,"The effect of pesticides on insects is often discussed in terms of acute and chronic toxicity, but an important and often overlooked aspect is the impact of sublethal doses on insect physiology and behavior. Pesticides can influence various physiological parameters of insects, including the innate immune system, development, and reproduction, through a combination of direct effects on specific exposed tissues and the modification of behaviors that contribute to health and reproductive success. Such behaviors include mobility, feeding, oviposition, navigation, and the ability to detect pheromones. Pesticides also have a profound effect on insect learning and memory. The precise effects depend on many different factors, including the insect species, age, sex, caste, physiological condition, as well as the type and concentration of the active ingredients and the exposure route. More studies are needed to assess the effects of different active ingredients (and combinations thereof) on a wider range of species to understand how sublethal doses of pesticides can contribute to insect decline. This review reflects our current knowledge about sublethal effects of pesticides on insects and advancements in the development of innovative methods to detect them. © 2024 by the authors."

A Case Study on the Field Lizard Podarcis siculus,2023,Veterinary Sciences,10,,,10.3390/vetsci10090583,"Soil contaminants (herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals) are among the main causes of change in terrestrial ecosystems. These substances lead to a general loss of biodiversity, both of flora and fauna and being able to biomagnify and pass through the food chain, they can endanger the survival of terrestrial vertebrates at the top of this chain. This review analyzes the risks associated with exposure to glyphosate, the active principle of many herbicide products, for the reproductive health of the field lizard (Podarcis siculus) potentially exposed to the substance in its natural habitat; therefore, introducing it as a possible model organism. Data demonstrate that glyphosate is toxic for this animal, affecting the health of the reproductive organs, both in males and females, and of the liver, the main detoxifying organ and closely involved in the female reproductive process. Sharing structural and functional characteristics of these organs with many other vertebrates, the information obtained with this reptile represents a wake-up call to consider when analyzing the cost/benefit ratio of glyphosate-based substances. The data clearly demonstrate that the P. siculus lizard can be considered a good target organism to study the reproductive risk assessment and hazards of exposure to soil contaminants on wild terrestrial vertebrates. © 2023 by the authors."

Intensified agriculture is often associated with increased use of pesticides and the use of pesticides could negatively impact also non-target species living in the vicinity of agricultural lands. We exposed larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) to a short-term exposure of a herbicide, a fungicide, or a mix of the two via their larval host plant (Plantago lanceolata). Survival and performance of the larvae was recorded and potential carry-over effects on adult butterfly fitness traits were assessed under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor enclosure. Our results showed significantly higher mortality of 60 % in the larvae exposed to the fungicide and 22 % mortality in the fungicide-herbicide mix treatment, with both treatments also impacting adult morphology. Adult female butterflies exposed to the mix of fungicide and herbicide treatment during their development also had lower lifetime reproductive success than the other treatment groups, suggesting that the combined chemical load had stronger carry-over effects into adulthood. Our results demonstrate clear negative impacts of a commonly used fungicide on a non-target butterfly species. The combined effect of two pesticides, while less lethal to larvae directly, seem to have a more profound carry-over impact on fitness of adult female butterflies. The mechanisms underlying the effects of a fungicide alone and in interaction with the herbicide, as well as the relatively minor impacts of herbicide alone on the specialist insect warrant further investigation in the role of pesticides in natural populations. © 2025 The Authors"

(Radish): effects of vermiwash and vermicompost applications on plant development,2024,Discover Food,4,,,10.1007/s44187-024-00101-y,"Long-term application of chemical fertilizers has negative impacts on soil health, crop productivity, and ecosystems. Hence, organic substrates have been proposed as alternatives for enhancing soil health and plant growth parameters. Among them, vermicompost and vermiwash are widely used in the sustainable agriculture sector to enhance plant growth, yield, and soil fertility. Hence, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of vermiwash and vermicompost on the growth of Raphanus sativus L. Pot culture experiments were conducted in four groups which included: group A) control soil (10 kg pot−1), group B) soil (8.5 kg pot−1) + vermicompost (1.5 kg pot−1), group C) soil (10 kg pot−1) + vermiwash (1.5 L pot−1), and group D) soil (8.5 kg pot−1) + vermicompost (1.5 kg pot−1) + vermiwash (1.5 L pot−1), respectively. The results revealed that the plants treated with vermiwash and vermicompost (Group D) had significantly enhanced the growth of the plants with higher germination percentage (100%), number of leaves (32.08%), length of leaves (56.35%), width of leaves (28.05), area of leaves (100.22%), shoot length of plant (78.02%), chlorophyll concentration (42.72%), leaf relative water content (13.30%), fresh weight (65.61%), dry weight of leaves (57.59), and tuber yield (74.96%) when compared to plants under groups A, B, and C. Furthermore, the application of the vermiwash and vermicompost combination improved the soil's physicochemical properties, increased glycine betaine concentrations, and decreased proline accumulation. Hence, this study suggests that vermicompost and vermiwash may be a potential source of plant nutrients for sustainable crop production. © The Author(s) 2024."

Sediments were collected twice in 2021 during low and high tide; waters were sampled on a seasonal basis. The results showed the prevalence of GPS and AMPA in the water with concentrations equal to 190 and 3053 ng/l, respectively. We also found GPS and AMPA in the sediments with values of 0.95 and 11.34 ng/g. In water, pesticides were detected in all seasons with peaks in concentrations during summer and spring. A significant positive correlation between the pesticides in the sediments and the water pH and a negative correlation with salinity was observed. An estimation of the average loads revealed a discharge of 64.11 kg/yr. of GPS and 958.37 kg/yr. of AMPA from the river to the marine environment. © 2024"
Flach H.; Pfeffer S.; Dietmann P.; Kühl M.; Kühl S.J.,Glyphosate formulations cause mortality and diverse sublethal defects during embryonic development of the amphibian Xenopus laevis,2024,Chemosphere,367,,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143624,"The human impact on environmental landscapes, such as land use, climate change or pollution, is threatening global biodiversity and ecosystems maintenance. Pesticides like the herbicide glyphosate have garnered considerable attention due to their well-documented harmful effects on non-target species. During application, the active ingredient glyphosate is utilized in various formulations, each containing different additive adjuvants. However, the possible effects of these formulations on amphibians - the group with the highest decline rates among vertebrates - remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of four glyphosate formulations (Glyphosat TF, Durano TF, Helosate 450 TF, Kyleo) on the embryonic development of the model organism Xenopus laevis (South African clawed frog). Embryos at the 2-cell stage were exposed to various concentrations of glyphosate formulations (glyphosate: 0.01–100 mg/L), and mortality as well as sublethal effects on different organs and tissues were analyzed. The results indicated that the formulations had different effects, particularly on the mortality of Xenopus laevis embryos. At sublethal concentrations, the formulations altered the embryos' external appearance, leading to malformations such as reduced eye and head size. In addition, exposure to formulations impaired heart morphology and function, and the expression of heart-specific genes was altered at a molecular level. Our results confirmed that glyphosate formulations had a stronger effect on Xenopus laevis embryogenesis than pure glyphosate. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the active ingredient and the co-formulations independently, as well as the combined, commercially available products, during pesticide risk assessments and renewal procedures of agrochemicals. The severe global decline of amphibians, partly due to herbicide use, highlights the need for strict and efficient monitoring of environmental pesticide loads and application areas. © 2024 The Authors"
Leblanc P.-O.; Breton Y.; Léveillé F.; Tessier P.A.; Pelletier M.,The impact of the herbicide glyphosate and its metabolites AMPA and MPA on the metabolism and functions of human blood neutrophils and their sex-dependent effects on reactive oxygen species and CXCL8/IL-8 production,2024,Environmental Research,252,,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.118831,"Significant levels of glyphosate, the world's most widely used herbicide, and its primary metabolites, AMPA and MPA, are detected in various human organs and body fluids, including blood. Several studies have associated the presence of glyphosate in humans with health problems, and effects on immune cells and their functions have been reported. However, the impact of this molecule and its metabolites on neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in the human bloodstream, is still poorly documented. We isolated neutrophils from human donor blood and investigated the effects of exposure to glyphosate, AMPA, and MPA on viability, energy metabolism, and essential antimicrobial functions in vitro. We observed that neutrophil viability was unaffected at the blood-relevant average concentrations of the general population and exposed workers, as well as at higher intoxication concentrations. Neutrophil energy metabolism was also not altered following exposure to the chemicals. However, while phagocytosis was unaffected, reactive oxygen species generation and CXCL8/IL-8 production were altered by exposure to the molecules. Alterations in function following exposure to glyphosate and metabolites differed according to the sex of the donors, which could be linked to glyphosate's known role as an endocrine disruptor. While ROS generation was increased in both sexes, male neutrophils exposed to glyphosate had increased intracellular production of CXCL8/IL-8, with no effect on female neutrophils. Conversely, exposure to the metabolites AMPA and MPA decreased extracellular production of this chemokine only in female neutrophils, with MPA also increasing intracellular production in male cells exposed to the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionine-leucyl-phenylalanine. Our study highlights the effects of glyphosate and its metabolites on the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils, which could be associated with health problems as future studies provide a better understanding of the risks associated with glyphosate use. Advances in knowledge will enable better and potentially stricter regulations to protect the public. © 2024 The Authors"

Although co-formulants in pesticide formulations were considered inactive components from the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pesticide, several studies have proven the high individual toxicity of formulating agents, as well as the enhanced combined toxicity of the active ingredients and other components. Since the majority of active ingredients are present in the form of chemical mixtures in our environment, the possible combined toxicity between active ingredients and co-formulants is particularly important. To assess the individual and combined phytotoxicity of the components, glyphosate was tested in the form of pure active ingredient (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and herbicide formulations (Roundup Classic and Medallon Premium) formulated with a mixture of polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEA) or alkyl polyglucosides (APG), respectively. The order of acute toxicity was as follows for Roundup Classic: glyphosate < herbicide formulation < POEA. However, the following order was demonstrated for Medallon Premium: herbicide formulation < glyphosate < APG. Increased photosynthetic activity was detected after the exposure to the formulation (1.5–5.8 mg glyphosate/L and 0.5–2.2 mg POEA/L) and its components individually (glyphosate: 13–27.2 mg/L, POEA: 0.6–4.8 mg/L), which indicates hormetic effects. However, decreased photosynthetic activity was detected at higher concentrations of POEA (19.2 mg/L) and Roundup Classic (11.6–50.6 mg glyphosate/L). Differences were demonstrated in the sensitivity of the selected algae species and, in addition to the individual and combined toxicity of the components presented in the glyphosate-based herbicides. Both of the observed inhibitory and stimulating effects can adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems and water quality of surface waters. © 2024 by the authors."

Due to its extensive application in agriculture, TBZ is frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems, posing potential risks to amphibians. However, the effects of TBZ-based formulations on amphibian development remain poorly understood. The present study investigates the effects of the TBZ-based fungicide Tebucur on the embryogenesis of the South African clawed frog. Two-cell stage embryos were exposed to varying concentrations of Tebucur (0.01–100 mg a.i./L) in a static non-renewal bioassay. The exposure time varied between four and 14 days, depending on the desired developmental stage of the embryos and the analysis method. Tebucur exposure resulted in mortality with a LC50-value of 8.0 mg a.i./L at 14 days. As well, various morphological abnormalities during neural and cardiac development emerged. Additionally, a reduction of overall mobility was observed. This underlines the need for strict regulation of the use of TBZ-formulations. © 2025 The Authors"

The extensive use of glyphosate has been related to environmental pollution and toxic effects on non-target organisms. Effective remediation and treatment alternatives must be developed to reduce the environmental presence of glyphosate and its adverse effects. Bioremediation using microorganisms has been proposed as a feasible alternative for treating glyphosate pollution; due to this, identifying and characterizing microorganisms capable of biodegrading glyphosate is a key environmental task for the bioremediation of polluted sites by this herbicide. This study characterized the glyphosate resistance profile and degradation capacity of the bacterial strain Caballeronia zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3. According to the results of the bacterial growth inhibition assays on agar plates, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 can resist exposure to high concentrations of glyphosate, up to 1600 mg/L in glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) formulation, and 12,000 mg/L of the analytical-grade molecule. In the inhibition assay in liquid media, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 resisted glyphosate exposure to all concentrations evaluated (25–400 mg/L). After 48 h exposure, GBH caused important bacterial growth inhibition (>80%) at concentrations between 100 and 400 mg/L, while exposure to analytical-grade glyphosate caused bacterial growth inhibitions below 15% in all tested concentrations. Finally, this bacterial strain was capable of degrading 60% of the glyphosate supplemented to culture media (50 mg/L), when used as the sole carbon source, in twelve hours; moreover, C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 can also degrade the primary glyphosate degradation metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). Genomic analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with the two reported metabolic pathways for glyphosate degradation, the sarcosine and AMPA pathways. This is the first report on the glyphosate degradation capacity and the genes related to its metabolism in a Caballeronia genus strain. The results from this investigation demonstrate that C. zhejiangensis CEIB S4-3 exhibits significant potential for glyphosate biodegradation, suggesting its applicability in bioremediation strategies targeting this contaminant. © 2025 by the authors."

GBHs are commonly used worldwide in weed control management. Due to their extensive application, they frequently occur in aquatic ecosystems and may affect various organisms. The active substance GLY and its major by-product, AMPA, are the most thoroughly studied chemicals; however, the adverse effects of the complex formulas of GBHs with diverse and unknown content of co-formulants are still not sufficiently researched. This study focused on the embryotoxicity, sublethal malformations, and estrogenic potency of GLY, AMPA, and four commonly used GBHs on zebrafish embryos using a wild type and an estrogen-sensitive, transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(vtg1:mCherry)). After 120 h of exposition, AMPA did not cause acute toxicity, while the LC50 of GLY was 160 mg/L. The GBHs were more toxic with LC50 values ranging from 31 to 111 GLY active equivalent (a.e.) mg/L. Exposure to 0.35–2.8 mg/L GBHs led to sublethal abnormalities: typical symptoms were structural deformation of the lower jaw and anomalies in the olfactory region. Deformity rates were 10–30% in the treated groups. In vivo, fluorescently expressed vtg1 mCherry protein in embryonic liver was detected by a non-invasive microscopic method indicating estrogenic action through vitellogenin production by GLY, AMPA, and GBHs. To confirm the in vivo findings, RT-qPCR method was performed to determine the levels of the estrogenicity-related vtg1 mRNA. After 120 h of exposure to GLY, AMPA, and three GBHs at a concentration of 0.35 mg/L, the expression of vtg1 gene was significantly up-regulated. Our results highlight the risk that short-term GLY and GBH exposure can cause developmental malformations and disrupt the hormonal balance in zebrafish embryos. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
