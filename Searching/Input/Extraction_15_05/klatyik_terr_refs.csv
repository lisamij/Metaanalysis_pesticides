This is alarming because of potential damaging effects on non-target organisms. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example Ghana, many rural farmers have not received training in the use of glyphosate-based herbicides, thus tend to apply higher than recommended concentrations on farms. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of glyphosate-based herbicides on beneficial insects under laboratory conditions, using Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Apini) and Hypotrigona ruspolii (Magretti) (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) as models. The bees were put in contact for 24 h with the recommended concentration of Sunphosate 360 SL, a glyphosate-based herbicide, 2x the recommended concentration, or distilled water as control. The effect of the herbicide on the bees was compared to the effect of a lambda-cyhalothrin insecticide. Generally, more bees died after contact with plants freshly sprayed with the herbicide than on herbicide-treated filter paper. In both cases, more bees died after contact with the higher concentration of the herbicide. These findings suggest that beneficial insects, specifically A. mellifera and H. ruspolii, may get killed if they are sprayed upon or come into contact with plants that have been freshly sprayed with (more than) the recommended concentration of glyphosate-based herbicides. Therefore, it is important to restrict access and use of such herbicides to trained personnel who will comply with spraying guidelines, that is, recommended concentrations and timing of spray. Spraying at a time when insects are flying about may be detrimental to beneficial insects such as pollinator bees, parasitoids, and predators.",2018,166,695,702,10.1111/eea.12694

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) have been shown to induce behavioral impairments, and it is possible that they mediate the effects through an altered GM. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of GBH on GM and its subsequent effects on the neurobehavioral functions in mice following acute, subchronic and chronic exposure to 250 or 500 mg/kg/day. The effect of these acute and repeated treatments was assessed at the behavioral level using the open field, the elevated plus maze, the tail suspension and splash tests. Then, mice were sacrificed and the intestinal samples were collected for GM analysis. Subchronic and chronic exposure to GBH induced an increase of anxiety and depression-like behaviors. In addition, GBH significantly altered the GM composition in terms of relative abundance and phylogenic diversity of the key microbes. Indeed, it decreased more specifically, Corynebacterium, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus in treated mice. These data reinforce the essential link between GM and GBH toxicity in mice and suggest that observed intestinal dysbiosis could increase the prevalence of neurobehavioral alterations.",2018,67,44,49,10.1016/j.ntt.2018.04.002
"Allegrini, M; Zabaloy, MC; Gómez, ED",Ecotoxicological assessment of soil microbial community tolerance to glyphosate,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Glyphosate is the most used herbicide worldwide. While contrasting results have been observed related with its impact on soil microbial communities, more studies are necessary to elucidate the potential effects of the herbicide. Differences in tolerance detected by Pollution Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) approach could reflect these effects. The objective of the present study was to assess the tolerance to glyphosate (the active ingredient and a commercial formulation) of contrasting soils with (H) and without (NH) history of exposure. The hypothesis of a higher tolerance in H soils due to a sustained selection pressure on community structure was tested through the PICT approach. Results indicated that tolerance to glyphosate is not consistent with previous history of exposure to the herbicide either for the active ingredient or for a commercial formulation. Soils of H and NH sites were also characterized in order to determine to what extent they differ in their functional diversity and structure of microbial communities. Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-PCR) indicated high similarity of Eubacteria profiles as well as no significant differences in abundance, respectively, between H and NH sites. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) indicated some differences in respiration of specific sources but functional diversity was very similar as reflected by catabolic evenness (E). These results support PICT assay, which ideally requires soils with differences in their exposure to the contaminant but minor differences in other characteristics. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of PICT approach with glyphosate examining tolerance at soil microbial community level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Fungicides are authorized for use during crop blooms because of their low acute toxicity to honey bees. Thus, a bee that might have been previously exposed to pesticides through contaminated food may be subjected to fungicide spraying when it initiates its first flight outside the hive. In this study, we assessed the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide in bees with different toxicological statuses. Three days after emergence, bees were subjected to chronic exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid and the herbicide glyphosate, either individually or in a binary mixture, at environmental concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mu g/L in food (0.0083 and 0.083 mu g/kg) for 30 days. Seven days after the beginning of chronic exposure to the pesticides (10 days after emergence), the bees were subjected to spraying with the fungicide difenoconazole at the registered field dosage. The results showed a delayed significant decrease in survival when honey bees were treated with the fungicide. Fungicide toxicity increased when honey bees were chronically exposed to glyphosate at the lowest concentration, decreased when they were exposed to imidacloprid, and did not significantly change when they were exposed to the binary mixture regardless of the concentration. Bees exposed to all of these pesticide combinations showed physiological disruptions, revealed by the modulation of several life history traits related mainly to metabolism, even when no effect of the other pesticides on fungicide toxicity was observed. These results show that the toxicity of active substances may be misestimated in the pesticide registration procedure, especially for fungicides.",2021,28,42807,42820,10.1007/s11356-021-13747-3

Therefore, winter honey bees, which have a long life span, could be exposed to these pesticides for longer periods than summer honey bees. In this study, winter honey bees were exposed through food to the insecticide imidacloprid, the fungicide difenoconazole and the herbicide glyphosate, alone or in binary and ternary mixtures, at environmental concentrations (0 (controls), 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g/L) for 20 days. The survival of the honey bees was significantly reduced after exposure to these 3 pesticides individually and in combination. Overall, the combinations had a higher impact than the pesticides alone with a maximum mortality of 52.9% after 20 days of exposure to the insecticide-fungicide binary mixture at 1 mu g/L. The analyses of the surviving bees showed that these different pesticide combinations had a systemic global impact on the physiological state of the honey bees, as revealed by the modulation of head, midgut and abdomen glutathione-S-transferase, head acetylcholinesterase, abdomen glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and midgut alkaline phosphatase, which are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, the nervous system, defenses against oxidative stress, metabolism and immunity, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of studying the effects of chemical cocktails based on low realistic exposure levels and developing long-term tests to reveal possible lethal and adverse sublethal interactions in honey bees and other insect pollinators.",2020,203,,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111013
"Andreasen, C; Streibig, JC",Evaluation of changes in weed flora in arable fields of Nordic countries - based on Danish long-term surveys,WEED RESEARCH,"P>During the last 50 years, agricultural productivity has increased tremendously, as have changes in the weed flora. In several European countries, weed surveys have been conducted regularly, of which the most frequent and consistent ones are Danish surveys conducted in 1911-1915, 1945, 1960-1970, 1987-1989 and 2001-2004. The surveys were carried out on fields not sprayed with herbicide in the sampling year. On the basis of this frame of reference, we discuss the changes in the weed flora during this period and relate them to findings in other Nordic countries and review the role of different farming practices on the weed flora of the past. Numerous agronomic factors and political initiatives to protect the environment have operated in concert. During the last 30 years, winter-sown crops have increased by almost 70%, at the expense of spring annual crops and grass leys, and this has favoured winter annual weed species. Maize is now widely grown and new weed species are invading arable land. Also, increased fertilisation levels over time have affected the weed flora. It is, however, obvious that herbicides play a major role in determining the composition, diversity and abundance of weed flora, although other factors such as mechanisation and the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU are also important. For the last 20 years, we have experienced an increase in some of the most frequent weed species without reductions in yield. This is probably due to governmental policies mandating lower herbicide efficacy goals for farmers, but it has been partly counteracted by genetic improvement of crops and better management.",2011,51,214,226,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00836.x
"Antier, C; Kudsk, P; Reboud, X; Ulber, L; Baret, PV; Messéan, A",Glyphosate Use in the European Agricultural Sector and a Framework for Its Further Monitoring,SUSTAINABILITY,"Monitoring pesticide use is essential for assessing farming practices and the risks associated with the use of pesticides. Currently, there are neither consolidated, public data available on glyphosate use in Europe, nor a standardized categorization of its major uses. In this study, data on glyphosate sales and use in Europe were collected from multiple sources and compiled into a dataset of the agricultural use of glyphosate from 2013 to 2017. The survey shows that glyphosate represented 33% of the herbicide volume sold in Europe in 2017. One third of the acreage of annual cropping systems and half of the acreage of perennial tree crops received glyphosate annually. Glyphosate is widely used for at least eight agronomic purposes, including weed control, crop desiccation, terminating cover crops, terminating temporary grassland and renewing permanent grassland. Glyphosate use can be classified into occasional uses-i.e., exceptional applications, triggered by meteorological conditions or specific farm constraints-and recurrent uses, which are widespread practices that are embedded in farming systems and for which other agronomic solutions may exist but are not frequently used. This article proposes a framework for the precise monitoring of glyphosate use, based on the identification of the cropping systems in which glyphosate is used, the agronomic purposes for which it is employed, the dose used and the rationale behind the different uses.",2020,12,,,10.3390/su12145682

Intensive production resulted in a strong dependence on chemical fertilizers, thus failing to maintain the structure, nutrient content and biological diversity of agricultural soil necessary for long-term production. These deteriorated soils are incapable of regulating and hindering pests, and therefore, agriculture and animal husbandry rely increasingly on the use of pesticides and veterinary drugs to control diseases, pests and parasites endangering crops and livestock. This chapter gives an overview of the European legislation on pesticides, natural and contaminated agricultural soil, as well as on the inter-relationship between the use of chemicals and the deterioration of soils in Europe.",2014,,93,112,

Because glyphosate is able to inhibit 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) not only in plants but also in different microorganisms, its application could lead to shifts in rhizosphere microbial communities in farming soils. In this study, greenhouse experiments were conducted with the objective to evaluate the effects of glyphosate on the composition and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial communities of transgenic soybean. This was especially relevant, because foliar applied glyphosate is transported down to the roots and exuded into the rhizosphere. After two foliar herbicide applications, root samples of treated and untreated plants were analysed by 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data and diversity indices were used to assess changes in the microbial populations in response to glyphosate applications. A comparison of rhizosphere communities revealed that the abundance of a T-RF representing microbes related to Burkholderia sp. significantly decreased under glyphosate application, while the abundance of a T-RF representing uncultured Gemmatimonadetes significantly increased. Interestingly, the bacterial community associated with soybean roots after glyphosate application not only demonstrated effective resilience after the disturbance but in addition, T-RF diversity also increased in comparison to the untreated control samples. The results suggest that bacterial diversity was even stimulated in the rhizosphere after glyphosate application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Of particular interest is the elucidation of the metabolic consequences of glyphosate toxicity in these species. Here we investigated the growth and metabolic responses of soil Pseudomonas species grown on succinate, a common root exudate, and glyphosate at different concentrations. We conducted our experiments with one agricultural soil isolate, P fluorescens RA12, and three model species, P. putida KT2440, P putida S12, and P protegerls Pf-5. Our results demonstrated both species- and strain-dependent growth responses to glyphosate. Following exposure to a range of glyphosate concentrations (up to 5 mM), the growth rate of both P protegens Pf-5 and P fluorescens RA12 remained unchanged whereas the two P putida strains exhibited from 0 to 100% growth inhibition. We employed a C-13-assisted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to monitor disruptions in metabolic homeostasis and fluxes. Profiling of the whole-cell metabolome captured deviations in metabolite levels involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, ribonucleotide biosynthesis, and protein biosynthesis. Altered metabolite levels specifically in the biosynthetic pathway of aromatic amino acids (AAs), the target of toxicity for glyphosate in plants, implied the same toxicity target in the soil bacterium. Kinetic flux experiments with C-13-labeled succinate revealed that biosynthetic fluxes of the aromatic AAs were not inhibited in P fluorescens Pf-5 in the presence of low and high glyphosate doses but these fluxes were inhibited by up to 60% in P putida K12440, even at sub-lethal glyphosate exposure. Notably, the greatest inhibition was found for the aromatic AA tryptophan, an important precursor to secondary metabolites. When the growth medium was supplemented with aromatic Ms, P putida S12 exposed to a lethal dose of glyphosate completely recovered in terms of both growth rate and selected metabolite levels. Collectively, our findings led us to conclude that the glyphosate-induced specific disruption of de novo biosynthesis of aromatic AAs accompanied by widespread metabolic disruptions was responsible for dose-dependent adverse effects of glyphosate on sensitive soil Pseudomonas species.",2017,5,,,10.3389/fenvs.2017.00034
"Baglan, H; Lazzari, CR; Guerrieri, FJ",Glyphosate impairs learning in Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae a field-realistic doses,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the world. Over the past few years, the number of studies revealing deleterious effects of glyphosate on non-target species has been increasing. Here, we studied the impact of glyphosate at field-realistic doses on learning in mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti). Larvae of A. aegypti live in small bodies of water and perform a stereotyped escape response when a moving object projects its shadow on the water surface. Repeated presentations of an innocuous visual stimulus induce a decrease in response due to habituation, a non-associative form of leaming. In this study, different groups of larvae were reared in water containing different concentrations of glyphosate that are commonly found in the field (50 mu g l(-1),100 mu g l(-1), 210 mu g l(-1) and 2 mu g l(-1)). Larvae reared in a glyphosate solution of 2 mg l(-1) (application dose) could complete their development. However, glyphosate at a concentration of 100 mu g l(-1) impaired habituation. A dose-dependent deleterious effect on leaming ability was observed. This protocol opens new avenues to further studies aimed at understanding how glyphosate affects non-target organisms, such as insects. Habituation in mosquito larvae could serve as a parameter for testing the impact of pollutants in the water.",2018,221,,,10.1242/jeb.187518
"Banks, ML; Kennedy, AC; Krerner, RJ; Eivazi, F",Soil microbial community response to surfactants and herbicides in two soils,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,"The environmental impacts of herbicides on desirable plants and the soil biota. are of public concern. The surfactants that are often used with herbicides are also under scrutiny as potentially harmful to soil biological systems. TO address these concerns, we used two soils, a silt loam and a silty, clay loam from south central Missouri, to investigate the impacts of herbicides and surfactants on soil microbial communities using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The surfactants used in this study were alkylphenol ethoxylate plus alcohol ethoxylate (Activator 90), polyethoxylate (Agri-Dex), and a blend of ammonium sulfate, drift reduction/deposition polymers and anti-foam agent (Thrust). The herbicides were glyphosate, atrazine and bentazon. Surfactants and herbicides were applied to soils at label rate, either alone or combined, to 4000g soil per pot. The two soils differed in history, texture, some chemical characteristics and several microbial community characteristics. A few of the chemicals altered some of the components of the microbial community after only one application of the chemical at field-rate. The Cole County, MO silt loam showed larger changes in the microbial community with application of treatments. For the Boone County, MO silty clay loam, Activator 90, Agri-Dex and bentazon treatments increased microbial biomass determined by PLFA; Thrust decreased PLFA markers, bacteria to fungi ratio; and Agri-Dex at both rates decreased monounsaturated fatty acids. Changes in the microbial community due to herbicides or surfactants were minimal in this study of a single application of these chemicals, but could be indicators of potential long-term effects. Long-term studies are needed to determine the changes in the microbial community after several years of annual applications of herbicides and surfactants on a wide array of soil types and management practices.

The current model species for standardized tests is Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei. However, these species are absent from agricultural soils and often less sensitive to pesticides than other earthworm species found in mineral soils. To move towards a better assessment of pesticide effects on non-target organisms, there is a need to perform a posteriori tests using relevant species. The endogeic species Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826) is representative of cultivated fields in temperate regions and is suggested as a relevant model test species. After providing information on its taxonomy, biology, and ecology, we reviewed current knowledge concerning its sensitivity towards pesticides. Moreover, we highlighted research gaps and promising perspectives. Finally, advice and recommendations are given for the establishment of laboratory cultures and experiments using this soil-dwelling earthworm species.",2018,25,33867,33881,10.1007/s11356-018-2579-9
"Battisti, L; Potrich, M; Sampaio, AR; Ghisi, ND; Costa-Maia, FM; Abati, R; Martinez, CBD; Sofia, SH",Is glyphosate toxic to bees? A meta-analytical review,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Glyphosate (GLY) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture. First considered as non-toxic or slightly toxic to bees, GLY and its different formulations have shown, more recently, to affect negatively the survival, development and behavior of these insects, even when used in doses and concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Thus, the results of research on the toxicity of GLY to bees are often conflicting, which makes a meta-analysis interesting for data integration, generating a statistically reliable result. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the GLY effects on mortality of bees through a meta-analysis. For this, a search was carried out in the databases Web of Science, CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil), Scopus, and PubMed. Papers that evaluated the effect of GLY on bee mortality published between 1945 and October 2020, were considered. After obtaining the data, R software was used to perform the meta-analytical tests. Sixteen papers on mortality were selected with 34 data sets. Most of the sets demonstrated differences between the control and experimental groups, showing that the treatments with GLY caused higher mortality of bees. The results considering the methodology used (ingestion or contact), the phase of the biological cycle (adults or larvae), and the dose (ecologically relevant dose and recommended by the manufacturer) were different when compared with their respective control groups. Therefore, GLY can be considered toxic to bees. It is important to emphasize that this meta-analysis identified that papers assessing the toxicity of GLY to bees are still scarce, for both lethal and sublethal effects, mainly for stingless and solitary bee species.

Using this technique, the genotoxic potential of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup Flash (R) (RU)) and two fungicide formulations based on tebuconazole and copper (Corail (R) and Bordeaux mixture (BM), respectively) was evaluated on terrestrial snail embryos. Clutches of Cantareus aspersus were exposed during their entire embryonic development to a range of concentration around the EC50 values (based on hatching success) for each compound tested. Three primers were used for the RAPD amplifications of pesticides samples. RAPD-HRS revealed concentration-dependent modifications in profiles generated with the three primers in RU (R)-exposed embryos from 30 mg/L glyphosate. For Corair (R)-exposed embryos, only two of the three primers were able to show alterations in profiles from 0.05 mg/L tebuconazole. For BM-exposed embryos, no signs of genotoxicity were observed. All changes observed in amplification profiles have been detected at concentrations lower than the recommended doses for vineyard field applications. Our study demonstrates the efficiency of coupling RAPD and HRS to efficiently screen the effect of pesticide formulations on DNA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Beier, F; Jedinger, M; Gruber, E; Zeller, JG",Temperature-Dependence of Glyphosate-Based Herbicide's Effects on Egg and Tadpole Growth of Common Toads,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Glyphosate-based herbicide formulations are broadly used in agriculture, silviculture, horticulture as well as in private gardens all over the world, thus posing the risk of potential contamination of nearby aquatic bodies inhabited by amphibians. Concurrently, climate change can be expected to alter the temperature of amphibian breeding sites. However, while either glyphosate-based herbicides or temperature have been shown to separately affect the development of amphibians, very little is known on possible interactive effects. We studied the impact of herbicide concentrations and temperature on growth and development of eggs and tadpoles of the Common toad (Bufo bufo L.). We hypothesized that (i) eggs would be better protected against herbicides than tadpoles because of their jelly coating, (ii) that higher temperatures would reduce potential herbicide effects because of an accelerated growth and a lower sensitivity of larger specimens. We conducted one experiment starting with eggs (Gosner stage, GS 8) and another experiment starting with tadpoles (GS 21-24) using a full factorial design with 5 concentrations of the herbicide formulation Roundup (R) LB Plus (0.0 mg acid equivalent L-1, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg a.e. L-1 and a pulse treatment with 3 times (egg experiment) or 5 times (tadpole experiment) addition of 0.5 a.e. mg L-1 over the course of several weeks) and two temperature levels (15 and 20 degrees C). Contrary to our expectation, our results showed that toad eggs are more sensitive to herbicides than tadpoles leading to an averaged 3196 increase in total length, tail length, and body length compared to the herbicide-free control. Tadpole morphology, development, or mortality was not influenced by herbicides. There was no correlation between herbicide concentration and the effect strength on eggs or tadpoles. Higher temperature accelerated growth of both eggs and tadpoles. As one of the first we also observed interactive effects between herbicide concentrations and temperature especially for egg development resulting in more pronounced herbicide effects at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. This is quite remarkable as ecotoxicologial risk assessment studies are usually conducted at a constant temperature, thereby perhaps not adequately examining non-target effects at natural conditions.",2016,4,,,10.3389/fenvs.2016.00051

The soil microbial community impacts on many soil properties. More than one-third of the terrestrial ecosystems are semiarid. However, a limited number of studies have been conducted to characterize soil fungal communities in semiarid grasslands, in particular those of agricultural fields. The aim of this study was to explore changes in the diversity and structure of soil fungal communities in semiarid grasslands, after different doses of glyphosate were applied under field conditions. Changes in soil fungal communities were examined using different approaches including culturing, calcofluor white stain and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The different approaches complement each other, revealing different aspects of the effect of glyphosate on soil fungal communities. We demonstrated a negative effect of glyphosate on soil fungal biomass at high doses and an early and transitory stimulatory effect on soil fungal biomass. We also found a negative effect of glyphosate on the species richness of cultivable fungi and changes in the molecular structure of soil fungal communities after double doses or long-term glyphosate application. In summary, our findings demonstrate an overall negative effect of glyphosate on soil fungal communities. (c) 2020 Asociacion Argentina de Microbiologi ' a.

"Benbrook, CM",Trends in glyphosate herbicide use in the United States and globally,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background: Accurate pesticide use data are essential when studying the environmental and public health impacts of pesticide use. Since the mid-1990s, significant changes have occurred in when and how glyphosate herbicides are applied, and there has been a dramatic increase in the total volume applied. Methods: Data on glyphosate applications were collected from multiple sources and integrated into a dataset spanning agricultural, non-agricultural, and total glyphosate use from 1974-2014 in the United States, and from 1994-2014 globally. Results: Since 1974 in the U.S., over 1.6 billion kilograms of glyphosate active ingredient have been applied, or 19 % of estimated global use of glyphosate (8.6 billion kilograms). Globally, glyphosate use has risen almost 15-fold since so-called Roundup Ready, genetically engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops were introduced in 1996. Two-thirds of the total volume of glyphosate applied in the U.S. from 1974 to 2014 has been sprayed in just the last 10 years. The corresponding share globally is 72 %. In 2014, farmers sprayed enough glyphosate to apply similar to 1.0 kg/ha (0.8 pound/acre) on every hectare of U.S.-cultivated cropland and nearly 0.53 kg/ha (0.47 pounds/acre) on all cropland worldwide. Conclusions: Genetically engineered herbicide-tolerant crops now account for about 56 % of global glyphosate use. In the U.S., no pesticide has come remotely close to such intensive and widespread use. This is likely the case globally, but published global pesticide use data are sparse. Glyphosate will likely remain the most widely applied pesticide worldwide for years to come, and interest will grow in quantifying ecological and human health impacts. Accurate, accessible time-series data on glyphosate use will accelerate research progress.",2016,28,,,10.1186/s12302-016-0070-0

Among those, the herbicide glyphosate and its main metabolite, the amino-methylphosphonic acid (AMPA), are among the most abundant and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. Through the foraging and storing of contaminated resources, honeybees are exposed to these xenobiotics. As ingested glyphosate and AMPA are directly in contact with the honeybee gut microbiota, we used quantitative PCR to test whether they could induce significant changes in the relative abundance of the major gut bacterial taxa. Glyphosate induced a strong decrease in Snodgrassella alvi, a partial decrease of a Gilliamella apicola and an increase in Lactobacillus spp. abundances. In vitro, glyphosate reduced the growth of S. alviand G. apicola but not Lactobacillus kunkeei. Although being no bee killer, we confirmed that glyphosate can have sublethal effects on the honeybee microbiota. To test whether such imbalanced microbiota could favor pathogen development, honeybees were exposed to glyphosate and to spores of the intestinal parasite Nosema ceranae. Glyphosate did not significantly enhance the effect of the parasite infection. Concerning AMPA, while it could reduce the growth of G. apicola in vitro, it did not induce any significant change in the honeybee microbiota, suggesting that glyphosate is the active component modifying the gut communities.",2019,14,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0215466

However, bee bread is a mixture of pollen pellets of different plants collected over a longer time period. Therefore, pesticide content in the hive varies with plant species and time of pollen collection. Hence, the analysis of bee bread is an approximate approach to gain information on detailed pesticide exposure during the agronomic active season. As high-resolution data is missing, we carried out a pesticide residue survey over five years (2012-2016) of daily collected pollen pellets at three agricultural distinct sites in southern Germany. 281 single day pollen samples were selected and subjected to a multi-pesticide residue analysis. Pesticide contaminations of pollen differed between the sites. Intensive pesticide exposure can be seen by high pesticide concentrations as well as a high amount of different pesticides detected. During the five years of observation 73 different pesticides were found, of which 84% are characterized as non-harmful to honeybees. To estimate pesticide risks for honeybees, the pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was calculated. Even though pesticides were detected in sublethal concentrations, we found substances not supposed to be exposed to honey bees, indicating the necessity for further improvement of seed treatments and increasing awareness of flowering shrubs, field margins and pesticide drift. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of nine pollen samples, divided into sub-fractions dominated by single plant species, revealed even higher concentrations in single crops for some pesticides.

The aim of this review is to present and discuss the state of knowledge on sorption, degradation and leachability of glyphosate in soils. Difficulties of drawing clear and unambiguous conclusions because of strong soil dependency and limited conclusive investigations are pointed out. Nevertheless, the risk of ground and surface water pollution by glyphosate seems limited because of sorption onto variable-charge soil minerals, e.g. aluminium and iron oxides, and because of microbial degradation. Although sorption and degradation are affected by many factors that might be expected to affect glyphosate mobility in soils, glyphosate leaching seems mainly determined by soil structure and rainfall. Limited leaching has been observed in non-structured sandy soils, while subsurface leaching to drainage systems was observed in a structured soil with preferential flow in macropores, but only when high rainfall followed glyphosate application. Glyphosate in drainage water runs into surface waters but not necessarily to groundwater because it may be sorbed and degraded in deeper soil layers before reaching the groundwater. Although the transport of glyphosate from land to water environments seems very limited, knowledge about subsurface leaching and surface runoff of glyphosate as well as the importance of this transport as related to ground and surface water quality is scarce.

It is absorbed after foliar application and quickly translocated inside the plant. In this study, we investigated the effects of Roundup speed, a commercial glyphosate formulation, on the structural composition (dominance of microbial groups, phospholipid fatty acid analysis-PLFA) and functional diversity (use of carbon sources, Multiple Substrate Induced Respiration- MSIR) of soil microorganisms. We specifically aimed at understanding the potential impact of biotic interactions on herbicide effects and included plants, earthworms, and endomycorrhizal fungi in the experimental setup. For this, we grew clover (Triton= repens) in the greenhouse and added mycorrhizal inoculum (Glomus mosseae) and earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) to the pots. Two weeks after foliar Roundup application and subsequent plant death, the pots were destructively sampled. The application resulted in a significant increase of microbial respiration (SIR) by approximately 30%. A multivariate analysis of the MSIR data exhibited small but significant differences between the microbial communities of treated and untreated pots, while no significant difference was apparent for the PLFA data. Bacterial PLFAs generally decreased following herbicide application, while mycorrhizal and fungal PLFAs were not affected. We did not find a consistent difference between the fatty acid markers of gram negative and gram positive bacteria. For all investigated parameters, there were highly significant differences between the upper (0-5 cm depth) and lower (5-10 cm) soil layers. The fact that rooting density differed by a factor of 3.5 between the two layers indicated that herbicide effects were especially pronounced in the clover rhizosphere and were likely due to changes in root exudate composition. We found significant, though very small, interactions between Roundup and other experimental factors (especially mycorrhizal inoculum).",2019,174,506,513,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.02.073

Concerns arise in particular when glyphosate formulations are proposed for vegetation control in areas inhabited by rare or threatened species.

The increasing consumption and the efficiency of glyphosate-based herbicides have encouraged several studies on their persistence in soils, their effects on soil microbiota and their degradation processes. Fungi have been reported as being the main herbicide-degrading microorganisms as well as the most tolerant to environmental stress conditions. This study evaluated the growth performance of Aspergillus section Flavi and Aspergillus niger aggregate strains on Czapek Dox media supplied with a commercial glyphosate formulation as sole source of carbon (CZC), phosphorus (CZP) or nitrogen (CZN). Six Aspergillus spp. strains were evaluated. Each medium was stab-inoculated with fungal spores from 7-day old cultures. Two measures of colony radii were taken daily. All of the Aspergillus section Flavi strains showed a significant increase (from 24 to 44%) in growth rate on the CZN medium, as compared to controls. The A. niger aggregate strains exhibited the same behavioral pattern under all the conditions tested, except on the CZN medium. Velutinous or slightly floccose colonies with abundant sporulation were observed on CZP. Moreover, the colonies produced sparse sporulation on CZC or CZN media, being their appearances completely different from those on the CZP medium. This study establishes that A. section Flavi and A. niger aggregate strains can grow in vitro in the presence of glyphosate, especially when it is used as a sole source of phosphorus or nitrogen.

Continuous application of pesticides may pollute soils and affect non-target organisms. Soil is a complex ecosystem; its components can modulate the effects of pesticides. Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate the potential environmental risk of these compounds in local conditions. We performed an integrated field-laboratory study on an Argentine soya field sprayed with glyphosate and chlorpyrifos under controlled conditions. Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of a series of endpoints for the assessment of adverse effects of the extensive use of these agrochemicals. Materials and Methods. A RR soya field in a traditional farming area of Argentina was sprayed with glyphosate (GLY) or chlorpyrifos (CPF) formulations at the commercially recommended rates, according to a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. In laboratory assays, Eisenia fetida andrei were exposed to soil samples (0-10 cm depth) collected between the rows of soya. Endpoints linked to behavior and biological activity (reproduction, avoidance behavior and bait-lamina tests) and cellular/subcellular assays (Neutral Red Retention Time NRRT; DNA damage - Comet assay) were tested. Field assays included litterbag and bait-lamina tests. Physico/chemical analyses were performed on soil samples. Results. GLY reduced cocoon viability, decreasing the number of juveniles. Moreover, earthworms avoided soils treated with GLY. No effects on either reproduction or on avoidance were observed at the very low CPF concentration measured in the soils sampled 10 days after treatment. Both pesticides caused a reduction in the feeding activity under laboratory and field conditions. NRRT was responsive to formulations of CPF and GLY. Comet assay showed significantly increased DNA damage in earthworms exposed to CPF treated soils. No significant differences in DNA migration were observed with GLY treated soils. Litterbag field assay showed no differences between treated and control plots. Discussion. The ecotoxicological effects of pesticides can be assessed by monitoring the status of communities in real ecosystems or through the use of laboratory toxicity tests. Litterbag field test showed no influence of the treatments on the organic matter breakdown, suggesting a scarce contribution of soil macrofauna. The bait-lamina test, however, seemed to be useful for detecting the effects of GLY and CPF treatments on the activity of the soil fauna. CPF failed to give significant differences with the controls in the reproduction test and the results were not conclusive in the avoidance test. Although the field population density of earthworms could be affected by multiple factors, the effects observed on the reproduction and avoidance tests caused by GLY could contribute to its decrease, with the subsequent loss of their beneficial functions. Biomarkers measuring effects on sub-organism level could be useful to predict adverse effects on soil organisms and populations. Among them, NRRT, a lysosomal destabilization biomarker, resulted in demonstrating more sensitivity than the reproduction and avoidance tests. The Comet assay was responsive only to CPE Since DNA damage can have severe consequences on populations, it could be regarded as an important indicator to be used in the assessment of soil health. Conclusions. Reproduction and avoidance tests were sensitive indicators of GLY exposure, with the former being more labor intensive. Bait-lamina test was sensitive to both CPF and GLY. NRRT and Comet assays revealed alterations at a subcellular level, and could be considered complementary to the biological activity tests. Because of their simplicity, some of these bioassays seemed to be appropriate pre-screening tests, prior to more extensive and invasive testing. Recommendations and Perspectives. This study showed deleterious effects of GLY and CPF formulations when applied at the nominal concentrations recommended for soya crops. Further validation is needed before these endpoints could be used as field monitoring tools in Argentine soya soils (ecotoxicological risk assessment - ERA tools).",2007,7,232,239,10.1065/jss2007.04.224

"Cederlund, H",Effects of spray drift of glyphosate on nontarget terrestrial plantsA critical review,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Glyphosate is a widely used broad-spectrum postemergent herbicide used for weed control in both agricultural and nonagricultural settings. Spray drift of glyphosate can pose a risk to nontarget terrestrial plants and plant communities outside the intended area of application, but the lack of a well-established predicted-no-effect drift rate makes properly assessing such risk difficult. For this reason, a literature review and meta-analysis was carried out with the aim to determine the level of drift that is likely to cause harm to plants and to explore what spray-reducing targets would be sufficiently protective. No-observed-adverse effect rates, lowest-observed-adverse effect rates, and effect rates giving 10, 25, and 50% effects were extracted from a total of 39 different publications. The data were combined per species, and species sensitivity distributions were constructed and fitted with a log-logistic model to assess protectiveness. No systematic differences were detected between the responses of monocotyledons or dicotyledons, but wild plants were found to be generally less sensitive to glyphosate drift than domesticated plants. The results indicate that restricting spray drift to a level below 5g a.e./ha would protect approximately 95% of all higher plant species against minor adverse effects of glyphosate drift and that rates below 1 to 2g a.e./ha would be almost completely protective. No studies were encountered that evaluated effects of spray drift against nonvascular plants, and therefore, the conclusions are only valid for vascular plants.

We kept forager workers of M. quadrifasciata in laboratory conditions and fed on food contaminated with three different concentrations of GBH for 10 days, after which the midgut digestive cell structure and ultrastructure were analyzed. The presence of GBH in food did not affect food consumption, indicating that M. quadrifasciata bees do not reject food contaminated with GBH. As digestive cells of the midgut release apocrine secretion as a detoxication mechanism, we expected that the ingestion of food contaminated with GBH in the present study affect the height of midgut digestive cells. However, such reduction did not occur, probably because of the low-test concentrations. Although there were differences in digestive cell ultrastructure, ingestion of GBH impaired midgut digestive cell cohesion by disorganizing the smooth septate junctions between cells, which may probably be caused by the adjuvant polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the GBH. Previous studies demonstrated that GBH increase bees' sensibility to intestine infections, based on the present results we hypothesized that the loss of cell cohesion in the midgut epithelium favors pathogenic microbial infections and harms food absorption, increasing bees' mortality.",2022,51,860,868,10.1007/s13744-022-01001-5

In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73 nanogram/gram (ng/g). It is notable that pollen collected by bumble bees in rural areas contained high levels of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (mean 18 ng/g) and thiacloprid (mean 2.9 ng/g), along with a range of fungicides, some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Pesticide exposure of bumble bee colonies in urban areas was much lower than in rural areas. Understanding the effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to complex mixtures of pesticides remains a major challenge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drosophilids have been utilized previously as an effective tool in toxicological tests. In the present study, the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup [Original]) were investigated regarding oxidative stress, the antioxidant defence system and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies (of both genders) that were 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different glyphosate concentrations (0.0 mg/L = control, 1.0 mg/L, 2.0 mg/L, 5.0 mg/L and 10.0 mg/L) in the diet for 24 h and 96 h. After the exposure periods, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were quantified. In addition, the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (i.e., keap1, sod, sod2, cat, irc, gclc, gclm, gss, trxt, trxr-1 and trxr-2) was evaluated via RT-PCR. Additionally, AChE activity was evaluated only after the 96 h exposure period. The results indicated that Roundup exposure leads to a reduction in ROS levels in flies exposed for 96 h. ACAP levels and gene expression of the antioxidant defence system exhibited an increase from 24 h, while LPO did not show any significant alterations in both exposure periods. AChE activity was not affected following Roundup exposure. Our data suggest that Roundup exposure causes an early activation of the antioxidant defence system in D. melanogaster, and this can prevent subsequent damage caused by ROS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Defarge, N; Otto, M; Hilbeck, A",A Roundup herbicide causes high mortality and impairs development of Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Glyphosate has and is being used extensively in herbicide formulations worldwide. Thus, glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) substantially add to the environmental load of pesticides and warrant a strict risk assessment. Ecotoxicological testing of herbicides focuses on non-target plants and higher animals while direct effects on arthropods are only cur-sory tested on the premise of contact exposure. However, oral exposure, as we show in our case, can be highly relevant for systemic pesticides, such as GBH. Specifically, in crop systems including genetically modified crops that are tolerant to GBH, these herbicides and their breakdown products are present both internally and externally of the crop plants and, therefore, are ingested by the crop-associated arthropod fauna. We tested the effects of oral uptake of the Roundup formulation WeatherMax on larvae of the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, a model organism in ecotoxicity testing programs. Long-term oral exposure of C. carnea larvae throughout its juvenile life stages was tested with concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 % dilution, thus, lower than the 1.67 % recommended for field applications. Inhibition of metamorphosis was observable at 0.1 % but at a concentra-tion of 0.5 %, GBH significantly impaired cocoon formation and led to massive lethal malformations.

To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36-48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10-20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants. Considering these new data, this assessment method appears insufficient to ensure safety. These results, taken together, shed a new light on the toxicity of these major herbicides and of pesticides in general.",2018,5,156,163,10.1016/j.toxrep.2017.12.025

We tested the endocrine disruption of co-formulants in six glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), the most used pesticides worldwide. All co-formulants and formulations were comparably cytotoxic well below the agricultural dilution of 1% (18-2000 times for co-formulants, 8-141 times for formulations), and not the declared active ingredient glyphosate (G) alone. The endocrine-disrupting effects of all these compounds were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme in the balance of sex hormones, below the toxicity threshold. Aromatase activity was decreased both by the co-formulants alone (polyethoxylated tallow amine-POEA and alkyl polyglucoside-APG) and by the formulations, from concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1/3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated for the first time that endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to co-formulants. These results could explain numerous in vivo results with GBHs not seen with G alone; moreover, they challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for GBHs exposures, currently calculated from toxicity tests of the declared active ingredient alone.",2016,13,,,10.3390/ijerph13030264

All herbicides were added to soil as pure compounds at recommended dose and were incubated under laboratory conditions for 60 days. High-throughput phylogenetic marker gene sequencing revealed that none of the herbicides significantly influenced the richness, evenness and composition of bacterial and archaeal communities. Likewise, the diversity, composition and size of nematode communities were not significantly influenced by any of the herbicides. From a functional perspective, herbicides did not significantly affect fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) and beta-glucosidase activities. Furthermore, the ability of soil organisms to utilise 15 substrates was generally unaffected by herbicide application. The only exception to this was a temporary impairment in the ability of soil organisms to utilise three organic acids and an amino acid.

The factors affecting bioavailability of stressors to enchytraeids and the nature of direct and indirect effects that may occur are discussed, and the importance of laboratory tests and field studies for the evaluation of toxic effects is underlined. The existing data on specific types of stressors such as pesticides' metals, fertilizers, and industrial and domestic chemicals often show clear responses of enchytraeids, and in many cases interspecific differences in sensitivity are recorded.

In the last decades it has spread across the continent where it outcompetes native slug and snail species, thus posing a threat for biodiversity. A popular anecdote suggests to promote Roman snails (Helix pomatia) in gardens because they are able to control A. vulgaris. We examined a potential interrelationship between these two species using a mesocosm experiment with lettuce plants. C-13-N-15 stable isotope labelling of lettuce allowed us to investigate interactions between Helix and Arion on weight gain/loss and herbivory. Additionally, we wanted to know whether different watering regimes (daily vs. every 3rd day watering of weekly amount) and earthworms alter these interactions. Egg predation of Helix on Arion eggs was further tested in a food-choice experiment. Arion showed a five times higher herbivory per body mass than Helix in a single-species setting. However, in mesocosms containing both species percentage of herbivory per body mass was significantly lower than in Arion-only mesocosms, especially when watered every three days. Overall isotope uptake via eaten lettuce was unaffected by the presence of the other species. Only very little predation (three out of 200 eggs) of Helix on Arion eggs was observed. Our results provide no evidence for a clear dismissal or confirmation of the popular gardener's anecdote that Helix snails have a negative effect on Arion abundance or herbivory.",2021,9,,,10.7717/peerj.11309
"Donley, N",The USA lags behind other agricultural nations in banning harmful pesticides,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,"BackgroundThe United States of America (USA), European Union (EU), Brazil and China are four of the largest agricultural producers and users of agricultural pesticides in the world. Comparing the inclination and ability of different regulatory agencies to ban or eliminate pesticides that have the most potential for harm to humans and the environment can provide a glimpse into the effectiveness of each nation's pesticide regulatory laws and oversight.MethodsThe approval status of more than 500 agricultural pesticides was identified in the USA, EU, Brazil and China and compared between nations. The amount of pesticides that were used in the USA and banned in these other nations was compiled and linear regression was used to identify trends in use.ResultsThere are 72, 17, and 11 pesticides approved for outdoor agricultural applications in the USA that are banned or in the process of complete phase out in the EU, Brazil, and China, respectively. Of the pesticides used in USA agriculture in 2016, 322 million pounds were of pesticides banned in the EU, 26 million pounds were of pesticides banned in Brazil and 40 million pounds were of pesticides banned in China. Pesticides banned in the EU account for more than a quarter of all agricultural pesticide use in the USA. The majority of pesticides banned in at least two of these three nations have not appreciably decreased in the USA over the last 25years and almost all have stayed constant or increased over the last 10years.ConclusionsMany pesticides still widely used in the USA, at the level of tens to hundreds of millions of pounds annually, have been banned or are being phased out in the EU, China and Brazil. Of the pesticides banned in at least two of these nations, many have been implicated in acute pesticide poisonings in the USA and some are further restricted by individual states.

Numerous options to control this slug are on the market; among the most commonly used are slug pellets containing the active ingredients metaldehyde or iron-III-phosphate and the application of parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita). These control measures potentially also affect non-target organisms like earthworms (Lumbricidae), which themselves can directly and/or indirectly alter a plant's susceptibility against slug herbivory. Also, the efficacy of slug control treatments is expected to be influenced by watering. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the influence of daily watering vs. every third day watering on slug control efficacy and potential interactions with earthworms. We found significant interactions between watering and slug control efficacy. Slug herbivory and biomass decreased after application of slug pellets; metaldehyde was more effective under less frequent watering while iron-III-phosphate was unaffected by watering. Parasitic nematodes had no effect on slug herbivory and biomass production. Earthworm activity was reduced with less frequent watering but did not interact with slug control.

Materials and methods Newly hatched snails were exposed for 168 days to soil and/or food contaminated with a formulation of glyphosate (BypassA (R)) or glufosinate (BastaA (R)) at the recommended field doses and also at 10-fold this dose. Results and discussion Herbicide degradation patterns showed that snails were mainly exposed during the first 28 days. The DT50 of glyphosate and glufosinate was established at 10.6 and 3.7 days, respectively. No significant effects on survival and growth were determined. Concerning genital tract maturation of the snails, exposure to herbicides tended to decrease the development of the albumen gland (inhibition of 43.5 +/- 32.8%). The presence of glyphosate (6 mg kg(-1) dry weight) was demonstrated in snails exposed continuously to this active ingredient at the highest concentration in their food. Conclusions These results showed a low effect of herbicides at relevant concentrations in soil but the detection of residues in tissues indicated a potential risk of transfer to the food chain.

The objective was to measure the exposure, the transfer and the effects of pesticides on a non-target soil invertebrate, the land snail Helix aspersa. There was no drift of the herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate) whereas the fungicides (cymoxanil, folpet, tebuconazole and pyraclostrobin) were detected up to 20 m from the treated area. For folpet and particularly tebuconazole, spray deposits on soil (corresponding to losses for the intended target i.e. the vine leaves) were high (41.1% and 88.8% loss of applied dose, respectively). For herbicides, the target was the soil and losses (percentage of compounds which did not reach the soil) were of 22% for glufosinate and 52% for glyphosate. In the study plot, glyphosate was transferred to and accumulated in snail tissues (4 mg kg(-1) dry weight, dw), as was its metabolite AMPA (8 mg kg(-1) dw) which could be in relation with the reduced growth observed in snails. No effects on snail survival or growth were found after exposure to the other organic compounds or to copper and sulphur-fungicides, although transfer of tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin and copper occurred. This study brings original field data on the fate of pesticides in a vineyard agro-ecosystem under real conditions of application and shows that transfer and effects of pesticides to a non-target organism occurred.

"Duke, SO; Powles, SB",Glyphosate: a once-in-a-century herbicide,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Since its commercial introduction in 1974, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] has become the dominant herbicide worldwide. There are several reasons for its success. Glyphosate is a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide, yet it is very toxicologically and environmentally safe. Glyphosate translocates well, and its action is slow enough to take advantage of this. Glyphosate is the only herbicide that targets 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), so there are no competing herbicide analogs or classes. Since glyphosate became a generic compound, its cost has dropped dramatically. Perhaps the most important aspect of the success of glyphosate has been the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops in 1996. Almost 90% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide are glyphosate resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing at a steady pace. Glyphosate/glyphosate-resistant crop weed management offers significant environmental and other benefits over the technologies that it replaces. The use of this virtually ideal herbicide is now being threatened by the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Adoption of resistance management practices will be required to maintain the benefits of glyphosate technologies for future generations.

The formation of these glyphosate-metal complexes in plant tissue may also impair micronutrient nutrition of nontarget plants when exposed to glyphosate drift or glyphosate residues in soil. In the present study, the effects of simulated glyphosate drift on plant growth and uptake, translocation, and accumulation (tissue concentration) of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) were investigated in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants grown in nutrient solution under controlled environmental conditions. Glyphosate was sprayed on plant shoots at different rates between 1.25 and 6.0% of the recommended dosage (i.e., 0.39 and 1.89 mM glyphosate isopropylamine salt). Glyphosate applications significantly decreased root and shoot dry matter production and chlorophyll concentrations of young leaves and shoot tips. The basal parts of the youngest leaves and shoot tips were severely chlorotic. These effects became apparent within 48 h after the glyphosate spray. Glyphosate also caused substantial decreases in leaf concentration of Fe and Mn while the concentration of Zn and Cu was less affected. In short-term uptake experiments with radiolabeled Fe (59Fe), Mn (54Mn), and Zn (65Zn), root uptake of 59Fe and 54Mn was significantly reduced in 12 and 24 h after application of 6% of the recommended dosage of glyphosate, respectively. Glyphosate resulted in almost complete inhibition of root-to-shoot translocation of 59Fe within 12 h and 54Mn within 24 h after application. These results suggest that glyphosate residues or drift may result in severe impairments in Fe and Mn nutrition of nontarget plants, possibly due to the formation of poorly soluble glyphosate-metal complexes in plant tissues and/or rhizosphere interactions.",2006,54,10019,10025,10.1021/jf0625196

For instance, a range of Fusarium mycotoxins can alter different intestinal defense mechanisms, such as the epithelial integrity, cell proliferation, mucus layer, immunoglobulins, and cytokine production. Of recent concern is the occurrence of emerging and masked Fusarium mycotoxins in agricultural commodities, which may contribute to toxic health effects, although the metabolic fate of masked mycotoxins still remains a matter of scientific discussion. These mycotoxins have attracted attention worldwide because of their impact on human and animal health, animal productivity, and the associated economic losses.

"Evans, SC; Shaw, EM; Rypstra, AL",Exposure to a glyphosate-based herbicide affects agrobiont predatory arthropod behaviour and long-term survival,ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Humans commonly apply chemicals to manage agroecosystems. If those chemicals influence the behaviour or survival of non-target arthropods, the food web could be altered in unintended ways. Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the most ubiquitous pesticides used around the world, yet little is known about if and how they might affect the success of terrestrial predatory arthropods in agroecosystems. In this study, we quantified the effects of a commercial formulation of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of three predatory arthropod species that inhabit agricultural fields in the eastern United States. We also measured the survival of the most common species. We tested the reactions of the wolf spider, Pardon, milvina, to either direct application (topical) or contact with a treated substrate (residual). We quantified the reactions of a larger wolf spider, Hogna helluo, and a ground beetle, Scarites quadriceps, to a compound (topical plus residual) exposure. Pardosa milvina reduced locomotion time and distance under topical herbicide exposure, but increased speed and non-locomotory activity time on exposed substrate. Both H. helluo and S. quadriceps increased non-locomotory activity time under compound herbicide exposure. Over a period of 60 days post-exposure, residually exposed P. milvina exhibited lower survivorship compared to topically exposed and control groups. Thus, exposure of terrestrial arthropods to glyphosate-based herbicides affects their behaviour and long-term survival. These results suggest that herbicides can affect arthropod community dynamics separate from their impact on the plant community and may influence biological control in agroecosystems.",2010,19,1249,1257,10.1007/s10646-010-0509-9

This seems to be the case of the herbicide glyphosate (GLY), the most widely used agrochemical worldwide. Its presence in honey has been reported in samples obtained from different environments. Hence, to understand its current and potential risks for this pollinator it has become essential to not only study the effects on honeybee colonies located in agricultural settings, but also its effects under laboratory conditions. Subtle deleterious effects can be detected using experimental approaches.

We studied a total of 16 commercial vineyards in the Tarnave wine region, a typical viticultural region in Transylvania, Central Romania. As a model organism for surface-dwelling arthropods we examined the response of springtail (Collembola) species richness and activity density to vineyard tillage practices, fertilization, and herbicide application. A total of 24 species in 10 families were found in the studied vineyards. Principal coordinates analysis (PGA) identified three distinct springtail communities linked to tillage and fertilization practice. Springtail species richness was positively associated with high tillage intensity (frequency: once or twice a year). Springtail activity density in inter-rows was positively correlated with inter-row tillage and herbicide application under grapevines. For the first time we could show that springtail species assemblages in vineyards were characterized by high niche overlap regarding soil quality (organic matter, pH, CaCO3, P and K), indicating similar resource utilization.

This paper analyzes the toxicological and oxidative stress and modulatory effects of a glyphosate commercial formulation (glyphosate F) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We detected ROS production and enhancement of oxidative stress response in glyphosate F-treated nematodes. Particularly, we found an increased ctl-1 catalase gene expression of a catalase specific activity. In addition, we showed that glyphosate F treatment activated the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, a critical target of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which modulates the transcription of a broad range of genes involved in stress resistance, reproductive development, dauer formation, and longevity. In summary, the exposure of glyphosate F induces an oxidative imbalance in C. elegans that leads to the DAF-16 activation and consequently to the expression of genes that boost the antioxidant defense system. In this regard, clt-1 gene and catalase activity proved to be excellent biomarkers to develop more sensitive protocols to assess the environmental risk of glyphosate use.",2018,214,1,8,10.1016/j.cbpc.2018.08.002

Recent studies report glyphosate residues from diverse habitats globally where the effect on non-target plants are still to be explored. Glyphosate disrupts the shikimate pathway which is the basis for several plant metabolites. The central role of phytohormones in regulating plant growth and responses to abiotic and biotic environment has been ignored in studies examining the effects of glyphosate residues on plant performance and trophic interactions. We studied interactive effects of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) residues and phosphate fertilizer in soil on the content of main phytohormones, their precursors and metabolites, as well as on plant performance and herbivore damage, in three plant species, oat (Avena sativa), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa). Plant hormonal responses to GBH residues were highly species-specific. Potato responded to GBH soil treatment with an increase in stress-related phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and jasmonic acid (JA) but a decrease in cytokinin (CK) ribosides and cytokinin-O-glycosides. GBH residues in combination with phosphate in soil increased aboveground biomass of potato plants and the concentration of the auxin phenylacetic acid (PAA) but decreased phaseic acid and cytokinin ribosides (CKR) and O-glycosides. Chorismate-derived compounds [IAA, PAA and benzoic acid (BzA)] as well as herbivore damage decreased in oat, when growing in GBH-treated soil but concentrations of the cytokinin dihydrozeatin (DZ) and CKR increased. In strawberry plants, phosphate treatment was associated with an elevation of auxin (IAA) and the CK trans-zeatin (tZ), while decreasing concentrations of the auxin PAA and CK DZ was observed in the case of GBH treatment.

Glyphosate residues are reported in soils from diverse environments, but the effects on plant physiology and consequences for species interactions are largely unknown. Here, we emphasize the complexity of these physiological processes, and argue that glyphosate residues modulate biosynthetic pathways, individually or interactively, which may affect interactions between plants and heterotrophic organisms. In this way, glyphosate residues can substantially interfere with plant resistance and the attraction of beneficial insects, both of which are essential elements in integrated pest management and healthy ecosystems.",2021,26,312,323,10.1016/j.tplants.2020.11.004

To investigate ovarian impacts of chronic GLY exposure, female C57BL6 mice were orally administered saline as vehicle control (CT) or GLY at 0.25 (G0.25), 0.5 (G0.5), 1.0 (G1.0), 1.5 (G1.5), or 2 (G2.0) mg/kg for five days per wk. for 20 wks. Feed intake increased (P < .05) in G1.5 and G2.0 mice and body weight increased (P < .05) in G1.0 mice. There was no impact of GLY on estrous cyclicity, nor did GLY affect circulating levels of 17 beta-estradiol or progesterone. Exposure to GLY did not impact heart, liver, spleen, kidney or uterus weight. Both ovarian weight and follicle number were increased (P < .05) by G2.0 but not affected at lower GLY concentrations. There were no detectable effects of GLY on ovarian protein abundance of pAKT, AKT, pAKT:AKT, gamma H2AX, STAR, CYP11A1, HSD3B, CYP19A, ERA or ERB. Increased (P < .05) abundance of ATM protein was observed at G0.25 but not higher GLY doses. A dose-dependent effect (P < .10) of GLY exposure on ovarian protein abundance as quantified by LC-MS/MS was observed (G0.25-4 increased, 19 decreased; G0.5-5 increased, 25 decreased; G1.0-65 increased, 7 decreased; G1.5-145 increased, 2 decreased; G2.0-159 increased, 4 decreased). Pathway analysis was performed using DAVID and identified glutathione metabolism, metabolic and proteasome pathways as GLY exposure targets. These data indicate that chronic low-level exposure to GLY alters the ovarian proteome and may ultimately impact ovarian function.",2020,402,,,10.1016/j.taap.2020.115116

Upon application, they are available to the biota in different ecosystems. The aim of this research was to evaluate the toxicity of Glyphosate and Atrazine based formulations (GBF and ABF, respectively). Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed to different concentrations of each single formulation, and to the mixture. Lethality, locomotion, growth, and fertility were measured as endpoints. Effects on gene expression were monitored utilizing green fluorescence protein transgenic strains. ABF caused lethality of 12%, 15%, and 18% for 6, 60, and 600 mu M, respectively, displaying a dose dependence trend. GBF produced lethality of 20%, 50%, and 100% at 0.01, 10, and 100 mu M, respectively. Locomotion inhibition ranged from 21% to 89% at the lowest and maximum tested concentrations for Atrazine; whereas for Glyphosate, exposure to 10 mu M inhibited 87%. Brood size was decreased by 67% and 93% after treatment to 0.06 and 6 mu M Atrazine, respectively; and by 23% and 93% after exposure to 0.01 and 10 mu M Glyphosate, respectively. There were no significant differences in growth. Changes in gene expression occurred in all genes, highlighting the expression of sod-1, sod-4, and gpx-4 that increased more than two-fold after exposure to 600 mu M ABF and 10 mu M GBF. The effects observed for the mixture of these formulations were additive for lethality, locomotion and fertility. In short, GBF, ABF, and their mixture induced several toxic responses related to oxidative stress on C. elegans.",2018,156,216,222,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.02.075

Glyphosate was applied based on giant foxtail height. Two applications of glyphosate provided better weed control than a single application, especially when applied to weeds 10 cm or less in early-planted corn. Yield was reduced occasionally with a single application on 5- or 10-cm weeds, because of weed re-infestation. Failure to control weeds before they reached a height of 15 to 30 cm also resulted in occasional yield loss. Application of atrazine or acetochlor plus atrazine prior to glyphosate did not consistently increase weed control or yield.

The traps were sprayed with two different concentrations of glyphosate commercial formulation and only with water. The number of cells per nest was significantly lower in glyphosate treated traps compared with the water treatment. The probability of finding breeding cells was two times higher in nests without glyphosate commercial formulation compared with treated nests.

Massive use of the parent compounds leads to the ubiquity of AMPA in the environment, and particularly in water. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss current insights into AMPA formation, transport, persistence and toxicity. In agricultural soils, AMPA is concentrated in the topsoil, and degrades slowly in most soils. It can reach shallow groundwater, but rarely managed to enter deep groundwater. AMPA is strongly adsorbed to soil particles and moves with the particles towards the stream in rainfall runoff. In urban areas, AMPA comes from phosphonates and glyphosate in wastewater. It is commonly found at the outlets of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). Sediments tend to accumulate AMPA, where it may be biodegraded. Airborne AMPA is not negligible, but does wash-out with heavy rainfall. AMPA is reported to be persistent and can be biologically degraded in soils and sediments. Limited photodegradation in waters exists. AMPA mainly has its sources in agricultural leachates, and urban wastewater effluents. The domestic contribution to urban loads is negligible. There is a critical lack of epidemiological data- especially on water exposure- to understand the toxicological effects, if any, of AMPA on humans. Fortunately, well operated water treatment plants remove a significant proportion of the AMPA from water, even though there are not sufficient regulatory limits for metabolites.

Herbicides can influence earthworms' survival, physiology and reproduction. However, there is a lack of data on herbicide effects on earthworms as they are often regarded as low or non-toxic. The aim of our study was to investigate whether widely used commercial formulations of glyphosate (GLF), tembotrione (TBT) and nicosulfuron (NCS) each applied at three environmentally relevant concentrations have adverse effects on various biomarkers and reproduction in epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena veneta. The activities of measured biomarkers varied depending on the herbicide used and the exposure duration and suggest that oxidative stress plays an important role in the toxicity of tested herbicides. Namely, GLF caused an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity induction after seven days, and NCS after 28 days, while TBT caused an inhibition up to 47% (6.6 mu g kg(dw)(-1) (soil)) after seven days. Only TBT caused a significant change (H2 = 13.96, p = 0.002) to catalase (CAT) after seven days of exposure. Malondialdehyde concentrations (MDA) were increased all the time after NCS exposure, but only after seven days in GLF and 28 days in TBT treatments, respectively.

"Haddaway, NR; Hedlund, K; Jackson, LE; Kätterer, T; Lugato, E; Thomsen, IK; Jorgensen, HB; Isberg, PE",How does tillage intensity affect soil organic carbon? A systematic review,ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE,"Background: The loss of carbon (C) from agricultural soils has been, in part, attributed to tillage, a common practice providing a number of benefits to farmers. The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT) (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC? Methods: We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence identified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths. Results: A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published in the 2 years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18 g/kg +/- 0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09 g/kg +/- 0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0-15 cm). IT was also found to be significant higher [1.30 g/kg +/- 0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0-15 cm). At lower depths, only IT SOC compared with HT at 15-30 cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89 g/kg [+/- 0.20 (SE)] lower in intermediate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30 cm than either HT [4.61 Mg/ha +/- 1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85 Mg/ha +/- 1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant. Conclusions: The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT was in the upper soil (0-30 cm) around 4.6 Mg/ha (0.78-8.43 Mg/ha, 95% CI) over >= 10 years, while no effect was detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils.",2017,6,,,10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9

Our experiment consisted of (1) non-treated weed plots, (2) plots, where weeds were killed by hoeing, and (3) plots treated with both Roundup and hoeing. We found that killing plants by hoeing had drastic effects on soil fauna and functioning, and apparently, distinguishing these effects from direct glyphosate effects is profoundly important when evaluating glyphosate risks in soils. In contrast, the effects of Roundup on soil fauna and functioning were minor and transient and no glyphosate remains were found in the soil at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that side-effects can be minor and glyphosate degradation effective also in soil under northern climatic conditions.",2019,9,,,10.1038/s41598-019-44988-5

However, pesticides have the potential to cause adverse human health or environmental effects, depending on exposure levels. This review examines existing pesticide legislation worldwide, focusing on the level of harmonization and impacts of differing legislation on food safety and trade. Pesticide legislation varies greatly worldwide, because countries have different requirements, guidelines, and legal limits for plant protection. Developed nations have more stringent regulations than developing countries, which lack the resources and expertise to adequately implement and enforce legislation. Global differences in pesticide legislation act as a technical barrier to trade. International parties such as the European Union (EU), Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have attempted to harmonize pesticide legislation by providing maximum residue limits (MRLs), but globally these limits remain variable. Globally harmonized pesticide standards would serve to increase productivity, profits, and trade and also enhance the ability to protect public health and the environment.

The objective of this, study was to determine the effect of Roundup Ultra on soil microbial biomass and activity across a range of soils varying in fertility. The isoproplyamine salt of glyphosate was applied in the form of RU at a rate of 234 mg active ingredient kg(-1) soil based on an assumed 2-mm glyphosate-soil interaction depth. Roundup Ultra significantly stimulated soil microbial activity as measured by C and N mineralization, as well as soil microbial biomass. Cumulative C mineralization as well as mineralization rate increased above background levels for all soils tested with addition of RU. There were strong linear relationships between C and N mineralized, as well as between soil microbial C and N (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). The slopes of the relationships with RU addition approximated three. Since the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate has a C to N ratio of 3:1, the data strongly suggest that RU was the direct cause of the enhanced microbial activity. An Increase in the C mineralization rate occurred the first day following RU addition and continued for 14 d.

Glyphosate resistance first appeared in Lolium rigidum in an apple orchard in Australia in 1996, ironically the year that the first glyphosate-resistant crop (soybean) was introduced in the USA. Thirty-eight weed species have now evolved resistance to glyphosate, distributed across 37 countries and in 34 different crops and six non-crop situations. Although glyphosate-resistant weeds have been identified in orchards, vineyards, plantations, cereals, fallow and non-crop situations, it is the glyphosate-resistant weeds in glyphosate-resistant crop systems that dominate the area infested and growing economic impact. Glyphosate-resistant weeds present the greatest threat to sustained weed control in major agronomic crops because this herbicide is used to control weeds with resistance to herbicides with other sites of action, and no new herbicide sites of action have been introduced for over 30 years. Industry has responded by developing herbicide resistance traits in major crops that allow existing herbicides to be used in a new way. However, over reliance on these traits will result in multiple-resistance in weeds. Weed control in major crops is at a precarious point, where we must maintain the utility of the herbicides we have until we can transition to new weed management technologies.

In addition to raising ecotoxicological concerns, the use of glyphosate adds phosphorus (P) to agricultural landscapes, influencing the accumulation and cycling of P in soil and nearby surface waters. Yet pesticides have been largely ignored when monitoring anthropogenic sources of P in agricultural watersheds. Estimating the supply of P derived from glyphosate use, both globally and in the US alone, we show that trends have markedly increased over the past two decades. Across the US, mean inputs of glyphosate-derived P increased from 1.6 kg P km(-2) in 1993 to 9.4 kg P km(-2) in 2014, with values frequently exceeding 20 kg P km(-2) in areas planted with glyphosate-resistant crops.

One of the main culprits for this decline is the widespread use of, and pollinators' chronic exposure to, agrochemicals. Here, we examined the effect of a field-realistic dose of the world's most commonly used pesticide, glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH), on bumblebee cognition. We experimentally tested bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) color and scent discrimination using acute GBH exposure, approximating a field-realistic dose from a day's foraging in a patch recently sprayed with GBH. In a 10-color discrimination experiment with five learning bouts, GBH treated bumblebees' learning rate fell to zero by third learning bout, whereas the control bees increased their performance in the last two bouts. In the memory test, the GBH treated bumblebees performed to near chance level, indicating that they had lost everything they had learned during the learning bouts, while the con-trol bees were performing close to the level in their last learning bout. However, GBH did not affect bees' learning in a 2-color or 10-odor discrimination experiment, which suggests that the impact is limited to fine color learning and does not necessarily generalize to less specific tasks or other modalities. These results indicate that the widely used pesticide damages bumblebees' fine-color discrimination, which is essential to the pollinator's individual success and to colony fitness in complex foraging environments. Hence, our study suggests that acute sublethal exposure to GBH poses a greater threat to pollination-based ecosystem services than previously thought, and that tests for learning and memory should be integrated into pesticide risk assessment.",2023,857,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159298

The sub-lethal impact of GLY on non-target organisms such as insect pollinators has not yet been evaluated. Apis mellifera is the main pollinator in agricultural environments and is a well-known model for behavioural research. Honeybees are also accurate biosensors of environmental pollutants and their appetitive behavioural response is a suitable tool with which to test sub-lethal effects of agrochemicals. We studied the effects of field-realistic doses of GLY on honeybees exposed chronically or acutely to the herbicide. We focused on sucrose sensitivity, elemental and non-elemental associative olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), and foraging-related behaviour. We found a reduced sensitivity to sucrose and learning performance for the groups chronically exposed to GLY concentrations within the range of recommended doses. When olfactory PER conditioning was performed with sucrose reward with the same GLY concentrations (acute exposure), elemental learning and short-term memory retention decreased significantly compared with controls. Non-elemental associative learning was also impaired by an acute exposure to GLY traces. Altogether, these results imply that GLY at concentrations found in agro-ecosystems as a result of standard spraying can reduce sensitivity to nectar reward and impair associative learning in honeybees. However, no effect on foraging-related behaviour was found. Therefore, we speculate that successful forager bees could become a source of constant inflow of nectar with GLY traces that could then be distributed among nestmates, stored in the hive and have long-term negative consequences on colony performance.",2014,217,3457,3464,10.1242/jeb.109520
"Herrmann, KM; Weaver, LM",The shikimate pathway,ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,"The shikimate pathway links metabolism of carbohydrates to biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. In a sequence of seven metabolic steps, phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate are converted to chorismate, the precursor of the aromatic amino acids and many aromatic secondary metabolites. All pathway intermediates can also be considered branch point compounds that may serve as substrates for other metabolic pathways. The shikimate pathway is found only in microorganisms and plants, never in animals. All enzymes of this pathway have been obtained in pure form from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources and their respective DNAs have been characterized from several organisms. The cDNAs of higher plants encode proteins with amino terminal signal sequences for plastid import, suggesting that plastids are the exclusive locale for chorismate biosynthesis. In microorganisms, the shikimate pathway is regulated by feedback inhibition and by repression of the first enzyme. In higher plants, no physiological feedback inhibitor has been identified, suggesting that pathway regulation may occur exclusively at the genetic level. This difference between microorganisms and plants is reflected in the unusually large variation in the primary structures of the respective first enzymes. Several of the pathway enzymes occur in isoenzymic forms whose expression varies with changing environmental conditions and, within the plant, from organ to organ. The penultimate enzyme of the pathway is the sole target for the herbicide glyphosate.

Compounds detected in >2% of the samples included: insecticides thiamethoxam (46%), bifenthrin (28%), clothianidin (24%), chlorpyrifos (17%), imidacloprid (13%), fipronil desulfinyl (7%; degradate); fungicides azoxystrobin (17%), pyraclostrobin (11%), fluxapyroxad (9%), and propiconazole (9%); herbicides atrazine (19%) andmetolachlor (9%). Concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng/g for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in samples collected from both grasslands and wheat fields; the location of the sample and the surrounding land cover at the 1000 m radius influenced the pesticides detected but because of a small number of temporally comparable samples, correlations between pesticide concentration and land cover were not significant. The results show native bees collected in an agricultural landscape are exposed to multiple pesticides, these results can direct future research on routes/timing of pesticide exposure and the design of future conservation efforts for pollinators.

In this study, we explored the potential effects of GBHs on urinary metabolites and their interactions with gut microbiome using a rodent model. Glyphosate and Roundup (equal molar for glyphosate) were administered at the USA glyphosate ADI guideline (1.75 mg/kg bw/day) to the dams and their pups. The urine metabolites were profiled using non-targeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Our results found that overall urine metabolite profiles significantly differed between dams and pups and between female and male pups. Specifically, we identified a significant increase of homocysteine, a known risk factor of cardiovascular disease in both Roundup and glyphosate exposed pups, but in males only. Correlation network analysis between gut microbiome and urine metabolome pointed to Prevotella to be negatively correlated with the level of homocysteine. Our study provides initial evidence that exposures to commonly used GBH, at a currently acceptable human exposure dose, is capable of modifying urine metabolites in both rat adults and pups. The link between Prevotella-homocysteine suggests the potential role of GBHs in modifying the susceptibility of homocysteine, which is a metabolite that has been dysregulated in related diseases like cardiovascular disease or inflammation, through commensal microbiome.",2021,11,,,10.1038/s41598-021-82552-2

It has been long recognized that some of these microbes, such as mycorrhizal fungi or nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria, play important roles in plant performance by improving mineral nutrition. However, the full range of microbes associated with plants and their potential to replace synthetic agricultural inputs has only recently started to be uncovered. In the last few years, a great progress has been made in the knowledge on composition of rhizospheric microbiomes and their dynamics. There is clear evidence that plants shape microbiome structures, most probably by root exudates, and also that bacteria have developed various adaptations to thrive in the rhizospheric niche. The mechanisms of these interactions and the processes driving the alterations in microbiomes are, however, largely unknown.

It has now become the most debilitating public health issue in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Previous studies showed SAN is a tubulo-interstitial type nephropathy and exposure to arsenic and cadmium may play a role in pathogenesis of the disease. Methods: Urine samples of patients with SAN (N = 10) from Padavi-Sripura, a disease endemic area, and from two sets of controls, one from healthy participants (N = 10) from the same endemic area and the other from a non-endemic area (N = 10; Colombo district) were analyzed for 19 heavy metals and for the presence of the pesticide-glyphosate. Results: In both cases and the controls who live in the endemic region, median concentrations of urinary Sb, As, Cd, Co, Pb, Mn, Ni, Ti and V exceed the reference range. With the exception of Mo in patients and Al, Cu, Mo, Se, Ti and Zn in endemic controls, creatinine adjusted values of urinary heavy metals and glyphosate were significantly higher when compared to non-endemic controls. Creatinine unadjusted values were significant higher for 14 of the 20 chemicals studied in endemic controls and 7 in patients, compared to non-endemic controls. The highest urinary glyphosate concentration was recorded in SAN patients (range 61.0-195.1 mu g/g creatinine). Conclusions: People in disease endemic area exposed to multiple heavy metals and glyphosate. Results are supportive of toxicological origin of SAN that is confined to specific geographical areas. Although we could not localize a single nephrotoxin as the culprit for SAN, multiple heavy metals and glyphosates may play a role in the pathogenesis. Heavy metals excessively present in the urine samples of patients with SAN are capable of causing damage to kidneys. Synergistic effects of multiple heavy metals and agrochemicals may be nephrotoxic.",2015,16,,,10.1186/s12882-015-0109-2

The complete formulations are unknown. For each declared active ingredient, there are dozens or hundreds of formulations. We demonstrate that petroleum has always been and is still always in pesticides. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were applied for 24 pesticides. The measured compounds were the 16-priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The ratio of the PAHs to the threshold of toxicity was from 2.16 to 8288 times. The levels and distribution of PAHs per pesticide were different. Petroleum residues appear to be a waste product. The declared active component is taken alone for toxicity calculations, such as the acceptable daily intake (ADI). The PAHs with 2-3 cycles are more represented in pesticides than those with 4-6 cycles, which underlines that the petroleum residues appear to come mainly from crude unburned material. The ADI should be divided by 1000 if it is considered that petroleum residues amplify the toxicity by 1000. The admixture of PAHs in pesticides can be highly carcinogenic or toxic in the long term, even more than the declared active ingredient itself.",2022,10,,,10.3390/toxics10110670

Results revealed that the co-exposure of glyphosate and multi-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) caused a synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth and metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana shoots. However, only a slight inhibitory effect was induced by nanotubes or glyphosate alone at the tested concentrations. Several intermediate metabolites of nitrogen metabolism and fatty acid synthesis pathways were upregulated under the combined treatment, which increased the amount of energy required to alleviate the disruption caused by the combined treatment. Additionally, compared with the two individual treatments, the glyphosate/nanotube combination treatment induced greater fluctuations in the phyllosphere bacterial community members with low abundance (relative abundance (RA) <1%) at both the family and genus levels, and among these bacteria some plant growth promotion and nutrient supplement related bacteria were markable increased. Strikingly, strong correlations between phyllosphere bacterial diversity and metabolites suggested a potential role of leaf metabolism, particularly nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism, in restricting the range of leaf microbial taxa. These correlations be.tween phyllosphere bacterial diversity and leaf metabolism will improve our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and the extent of their drivers of variation and the underlying causes of variability in bacterial community composition.

The existing scientific literature contains conflicting results, from no observable effect of glyphosate to the enrichment of agricultural pathogens such as Fusarium spp. We conducted a comprehensive field-based study to compare the microbial communities on the roots of plants that received a foliar application of glyphosate to adjacent plants that did not. The 2-year study was conducted in Beltsville, MD, and Stoneville, MS, with corn and soybean crops grown in a variety of organic and conventional farming systems. By sequencing environmental metabarcode amplicons, the prokaryotic and fungal communities were described, along with chemical and physical properties of the soil. Sections of corn and soybean roots were plated to screen for the presence of plant pathogens. Geography, farming system, and season were significant factors determining the composition of fungal and prokaryotic communities. Plots treated with glyphosate did not differ from untreated plots in overall microbial community composition after controlling for other factors. We did not detect an effect of glyphosate treatment on the relative abundance of organisms such as Fusarium spp. IMPORTANCE Increasing the efficiency of food production systems while reducing negative environmental effects remains a key societal challenge to successfully meet the needs of a growing global population. The herbicide glyphosate has become a nearly ubiquitous component of agricultural production across the globe, enabling an increasing adoption of no-till agriculture. Despite this widespread use, there remains considerable debate on the consequences of glyphosate exposure. In this paper, we examine the effect of glyphosate on soil microbial communities associated with the roots of glyphosate-resistant crops. Using metabarcoding techniques, we evaluated prokaryotic and fungal communities from agricultural soil samples (n = 768).

The risk of leaching was thus evaluated for glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) and its degradation product AMPA (amino-methylphosphonic acid) under field conditions at one sandy and two loamy sites. Over a 2-yr period, tile-drainage water, ground water, and soil water were sampled and analyzed for pesticides. At a sandy site, the strong soil sorption capacity and lack of macropores seemed to prevent leaching of both glyphosate and AMPA. At one loamy site, which received low precipitation with little intensity, the residence time within the root zone seemed sufficient to prevent leaching of glyphosate, probably due to degradation and sorption. Minor leaching of AMPA was observed at this site, although the concentration was generally low, being on the order of 0.05 mu g L-1 or less. At another loamy site, however, glyphosate and AMPA leached from the root zone into the tile drains (I m below ground surface [BGS]) in average concentrations exceeding 0.1 mu g L-1, which is the EU threshold value for drinking water. The leaching of glyphosate was mainly governed by pronounced macropore flow occurring within the first months after application. AMPA was frequently detected more than 1.5 yr after application, thus indicating a minor release and limited degradation capacity within the soil. Leaching has so far been confined to the depth of the tile drains, and the pesticides have rarely been detected in monitoring screens located at lower depths. This study suggests that as both glyphosate and AMPA can leach through structured soils, they thereby pose a potential risk to the aquatic environment.",2005,34,608,620,10.2134/jeq2005.0608
"Klátyik, S; Bohus, P; Darvas, B; Székács, A",Authorization and Toxicity of Veterinary Drugs and Plant Protection Products: Residues of the Active Ingredients in Food and Feed and Toxicity Problems Related to Adjuvants,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,"Chemical substances applied in animal husbandry or veterinary medicine and in crop protection represent substantial environmental loads, and their residues occur in food and feed products. Product approval is governed differently in these two sectors in the European Union (EU), and the occurrence of veterinary drug (VD) and pesticide residues indicated by contamination notification cases in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the EU also show characteristic differences. While the initial high numbers of VD residues reported in 2002 were successfully suppressed to less than 100 cases annually by 2006 and on, the number of notification cases for pesticide residues showed a gradual increase from a low (approximately 50 cases annually) initial level until 2005 to more than 250 cases annually after 2009, with a halt occurring only in 2016. Main notifiers of VD residues include Germany, Belgium, the UK, and Italy (63, 59, 42, and 31 notifications announced, respectively), and main consigning countries of non-compliances are Vietnam, India, China, and Brazil (88, 50, 34, and 23 notifications, respectively). Thus, countries of South and Southeast Asia are considered a vulnerable point with regard to VD residues entering the EU market. Unintended side effects of VDs and plant protection products may be caused not only by the active ingredients but also by various additives in these preparations. Adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) and other co-formulants used in therapeutic agents and feed additives, as well as in pesticide formulations have long been considered as inactive ingredients in the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pharmaceutical or pesticide, and in turn, legal regulations of the approval and marketing of these additives specified significantly less stringent risk assessment requirements, than those specified for the active ingredients. However, numerous studies have shown additive, synergistic, or antagonistic side effects between the active ingredients and their additives in formulated products; moreover, toxicity has been evidenced for various additives. Therefore, toxicological evaluation of surfactants and other additives is essential for proper environmental risk assessment of formulations used in agriculture including animal husbandry and plant protection.",2017,4,,,10.3389/fvets.2017.00146

In the present study, we quantified pesticides and related substances in ambient air at 69 sites using passive air samplers and ventilation filter mats. It is, to our knowledge, so far the most comprehensive data set on pesticides and their related products in ambient air in Germany. Results Samples were collected in 2019 and analysed for over 500 substances. One hundred and nine (109) were detected, including 28 that are not approved for use in Germany. In each sampling site, we identified one to 36 substances, including locations such as national parks and forests. Here, the presence of pesticides is not expected, e.g., on the highest mountain top in the national park Harz (13 substances) and in the Bavarian Forest (six substances). Glyphosate was recorded in every sample. More than half of passive air samplers contained chlorothalonil, metolachlor, pendimethalin, terbuthylazine, prothioconazole-desthio, dimethenamid, prosulfocarb, flufenacet, tebuconazole, aclonifen, chlorflurenol, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH). Filter mats also contained boscalid. The statistical analysis showed that landscape classification and agricultural intensity were the primary factors influencing the number of substances detected in ambient air. Location, such as protected areas or regions of organic farming, had only a small effect on the number of substances recorded. Medium- and long-range transport likely accounts for these findings. Extending the current sampling method will probably detect more pesticides than the data currently suggest. Conclusions Airborne pesticide mixtures are ubiquitous in Germany, which is particularly concerning for glyphosate, pendimethalin, and prosulfocarb. Deposition of these pesticides on organic products may disqualify them from the market, resulting in economic losses to farmers. Air concentrations of pesticides are a relevant issue and must be reduced.",2021,33,,,10.1186/s12302-021-00553-4

One of the most widely used agricultural pesticides worldwide is the herbicide glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine), commonly known as Roundup. There are an increasing number of conflicting reports regarding the direct exposure toxicity (risk) of glyphosate, but no rigorous investigations on the generational actions. The current study using a transient exposure of gestating F0 generation female rats found negligible impacts of glyphosate on the directly exposed F0 generation, or F1 generation offspring pathology. In contrast, dramatic increases in pathologies in the F2 generation grand-offspring, and F3 transgenerational greatgrand-offspring were observed. The transgenerational pathologies observed include prostate disease, obesity, kidney disease, ovarian disease, and parturition (birth) abnormalities. Epigenetic analysis of the F1, F2 and F3 generation sperm identified differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). A number of DMR associated genes were identified and previously shown to be involved in pathologies. Therefore, we propose glyphosate can induce the transgenerational inheritance of disease and germline (e.g. sperm) epimutations. Observations suggest the generational toxicology of glyphosate needs to be considered in the disease etiology of future generations.",2019,9,,,10.1038/s41598-019-42860.0

Typhimurium and Escherichia coli antibiotic responses,MICROBIOLOGY-SGM,"Herbicides are frequently released into both rural and urban environments. Commercial herbicide formulations induce adaptive changes in the way bacteria respond to antibiotics. Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli were exposed to common co-formulants of formulations, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium was exposed to active ingredients dicamba, 2,4-D and glyphosate to determine what ingredients of the commercial formulations caused this effect. Co-formulants Tween80 and carboxymethyl cellulose induced changes in response, but the pattern of the responses differed from the active ingredients, and effect sizes were smaller. A commercial wetting agent did not affect antibiotic responses. Active ingredients induced changes in antibiotic responses similar to those caused by complete formulations. This occurred at or below recommended application concentrations. Targeted deletion of efflux pump genes largely neutralized the adaptive response in the cases of increased survival in antibiotics, indicating that the biochemistry of induced resistance was the same for formulations and specific ingredients. We found that glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D, as well as co-formulants in commercial herbicides, induced a change in susceptibility of the potentially pathogenic bacteria E. coli and S. enterica to multiple antibiotics. This was measured using the efficiency of plating (EOP), the relative survival of the bacteria when exposed to herbicide and antibiotic, or just antibiotic, compared to survival on permissive media.

Many biocides are known to induce an adaptive multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype. This can be due to either an increase in the expression of efflux pumps, a reduced synthesis of outer membrane porins, or both. Exposures of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to commercial formulations of three herbicides-dicamba (Kamba), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and glyphosate (Roundup)-were found to induce a changed response to antibiotics. Killing curves in the presence and absence of sublethal herbicide concentrations showed that the directions and the magnitudes of responses varied by herbicide, antibiotic, and species. When induced, MICs of antibiotics of five different classes changed up to 6-fold. In some cases the MIC increased, and in others it decreased. Herbicide concentrations needed to invoke the maximal response were above current food maximum residue levels but within application levels for all herbicides. Compounds that could cause induction had additive effects in combination. The role of soxS, an inducer of the AcrAB efflux pump, was tested in beta-galactosidase assays with soxS-lacZ fusion strains of E. coli. Dicamba was a moderate inducer of the sox regulon. Growth assays with Phe-Arg beta-naphtylamide (PA beta N), an efflux pump inhibitor, confirmed a significant role of efflux in the increased tolerance of E. coli to chloramphenicol in the presence of dicamba and to kanamycin in the presence of glyphosate. Pathways of exposure with relevance to the health of humans, domestic animals, and critical insects are discussed. IMPORTANCE Increasingly common chemicals used in agriculture, domestic gardens, and public places can induce a multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype in potential pathogens. The effect occurs upon simultaneous exposure to antibiotics and is faster than the lethal effect of antibiotics. The magnitude of the induced response may undermine antibiotic therapy and substantially increase the probability of spontaneous mutation to higher levels of resistance. The combination of high use of both herbicides and antibiotics in proximity to farm animals and important insects, such as honeybees, might also compromise their therapeutic effects and drive greater use of antibiotics. To address the crisis of antibiotic resistance requires broadening our view of environmental contributors to the evolution of resistance.",2015,6,,,10.1128/mBio.00009-15

Toads were exposed to a solution containing a nominal concentration of commercial formulations of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF, 10 mg/L), and herbicides 2,4-D and glyphosate (GLY) (20 mg/L, respectively). After 48 h of exposure, the levels of plasma B-sterases (BChE and CbE) were inhibited (55 and 43 %, respectively) in toads exposed to CPF. Also, the activity of GST was inducted for dermal exposure to 2,4-D, as well as the levels of TBARS due to CPF exposure. Besides this, CPF and 2,4-D exposure induced oxidative DNA damage, and the H/L ratio decreased for the both herbicide exposures. Our results showed that exposure via dermal uptake to CPF, 2,4-D, and GLY in the common toad R. arenarum induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immunological depression.

We describe some of the research that has been carried out in the areas of neurotoxicology, genetic toxicology, and environmental toxicology, as well as high-throughput experiments with C. elegans including genome-wide screening for molecular targets of toxicity and rapid toxicity assessment for new chemicals. We argue for an increased role for C. elegans in complementing other model systems in toxicological research.",2008,106,5,28,10.1093/toxsci/kfn121
"Liess, M; Henz, S; Shahid, N",Modeling the synergistic effects of toxicant mixtures,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background: Toxicants often occur simultaneously. Some combinations show synergistic combined effects that go far beyond what is predicted with current effect models. Up until now, only the combined additive effects of similar acting chemicals have been assessed accurately, whereas the combined effects of dissimilar acting chemicals have been greatly underestimated in many cases. Results: Here, we use the individual tri-phasic concentration-response relationship of two toxicants with different modes of action to model their combined synergistic effect onDaphnia magna. The novel stress addition approach (SA) predicted the combined effects (LC50) of different esfenvalerate and prochloraz combinations with an uncertainty factor of 2.8 at most, while the traditional effect addition (EA) and concentration addition (CA) approaches underestimated the combined effect by a factor of up to 150 and 660, respectively. Data of the single substance concentration-response relationships and on their combined effects enable to determine the degree of synergism. For the evaluation of the combined toxicant effect, we provide the approach as R package and as Indicate model (http:// www.systemecology.eu/indicate/). Conclusion: Adding stressors arithmetically, considering non-monotonic cause-effect relationships, is a decisive component in predicting the combined effects of multiple stressors within test systems. However, the extent of the synergistic effects that multiple stressors exert on populations within the ecosystem context is still highly controversial. Various processes are relevant at the ecosystem level, which are not considered in laboratory studies. However, the present work serves as a building block for understanding the effects of multiple stressors in the field.",2020,32,,,10.1186/s12302-020-00394-7

This accumulation has become a serious environmental issue, as it threatens life of earthworms, inhibits the enzyme activities and microbial diversity, and contributes to the loss of soil microbial carbon and nitrogen. However, little information is available regarding the effects of pesticides on soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is also unknown how plastic debris, especially small-sized particles called micro plastics, influences the effects of pesticides on soil DOM. In this study, we performed a 30-day soil incubation experiment. Three levels of the common herbicide glyphosate were applied to soil: 0 (control, CK), 3.6 kg ha(-1) (G1) and 7.2 kg ha(-1) (G2). We also tested four levels of glyphosate and microplastics (homopolymer polypropylene powder) co-addition: 3.6 kg ha(-1) + 7% (w/w) (M1G1), 3.6 kg ha(-1)+ 28% (w/w) (M2G1), 7.2 kg ha(-1) + 7% (w/w) (M1G2), and 7.2 kg ha(-1)+ 28% (w/w) (M2G2). Glyphosate addition slightly increased soil fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) and phenol oxidase (PO) activities. Although the glyphosate addition significantly promoted the accumulation of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) within the first 14 days, the M2 treatment decreased DOP at day 30. M2G1 and M2G2 increased soil FDAse activity and promoted the accumulation of DOC and DOP relative to G1 and G2 respectively while M1G1 and M1G2 benefited DON accumulation. Our results highlighted that the interaction between glyphosate and low microplastics content negatively affected DOC and DOP dynamics, leading to the loss of bioavailable C and P loss. The interaction between glyphosate and high content microplastics negatively affected DON compared with glyphosate addition, possibly decreasing DON.",2019,182,,,10.1016/j.catena.2019.104177

The present study evaluated the genotoxic, mutagenic, and histopathological hepatic responses of Dendropsophus minutus tadpoles to acute exposure (96 h) to the herbicide glyphosate (GLY, 65, 130, 260 and 520 mu g/L) and the surfactant polyoxyethylene amine (POEA, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mu g/L). On average, 174 % more genomic damage was observed in the tadpoles exposed to all concentrations of POEA in comparison with the control, while up to seven times more micronuclei were recorded, on average, at a concentration of 5 mu g/L of POEA. All the individuals exposed to 10 mu g/L of POEA died. The tadpoles exposed to GLY presented 165 % more DNA damage than the control, on average, at the highest concentrations (260 and 520 mu g/L), and up to six times more micronuclei at 520 mu g/L. The Erythrocyte Nuclear Abnormality test (ENA) detected a relatively high frequency of cells with lobed nuclei in the tadpoles expose to POEA at 5 mu g/L and binucleated cells in those exposed to GLY at 520 mu g/L. The hepatic histopathological observations revealed several types of lesions in the tadpoles exposed to both GLY and POEA. Overall, then, the results of the study indicate that both GLY and POEA have potential genotoxic, mutagenic, and hepatotoxic effects in D. minutus tadpoles. We emphasize the need for further studies to monitor the amphibian populations, such as those of D. minutus, which breed in aquatic environments associated with agricultural areas.

Previous studies have reported sublethal effects of glyphosate on honeybees. However, the effects of commercially formulated glyphosate (CFG) at the recommended concentration (RC) on the chronic toxicity of honeybees, especially on their behaviours, remain unknown. In this study, a series of behavioural experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of CFG on honeybees. The results showed that there was a significant decline in water responsiveness at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC after 3 h of exposure to CFG for 11 days. The CFG significantly reduced sucrose responsiveness at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. In addition, CFG significantly affected olfactory learning ability at 1/2x, 1x, and 2xthe RC and negatively affected memory ability at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. The climbing ability of honeybees also significantly decreased at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC. Our findings indicated that, after they were chronically exposed to CFG at the RC, honeybees exhibited behavioural changes.

Environmental risk assessments (ERA) on nontarget organisms mostly consider the active ingredients (AIs) of these herbicides, while much less is known on effects of commercial GBH formulations that are actually applied in the field. Moreover, it is largely unknown to what extent different soil characteristics alter potential side effects of herbicides. We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing a model weed population of Amaranthus retroflexus in arable field soil with either 3.0 or 4.1% soil organic matter (SOM) content and treated these weeds either with GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex) or their respective AIs (isopropylammonium, diammonium or potassium salts of glyphosate) at recommended dosages. Control pots were mechanically weeded. Nontarget effects were assessed on the surface activity of the springtail species Sminthurinus niger (pitfall trapping) and litter decomposition in the soil (teabag approach). Both GBHs and AIs increased the surface activity of springtails compared to control pots; springtail activity was higher under GBHs than under corresponding AIs. Stimulation of springtail activity was much higher in soil with higher SOM content than with low SOM content (significant treatment x SOM interaction). Litter decomposition was unaffected by GBHs, AIs or SOM levels. We suggest that ERAs for pesticides should be performed with actually applied herbicides rather than only on AIs and should also consider influences of different soil properties.",2020,27,17280,17289,10.1007/s11356-020-08213-5

Fungi were analyzed using classical sequencing technology and bacteria using next-generation sequencing. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) comprising bacteria, yeasts and molds was higher under flazasulfuron compared to all other treatments which had similar CFU levels. Abundance of the fungus Mucor was higher under flazasulfuron than glufosinate and mechanical weeding; Mucor was absent under glyphosate. Several other fungi taxa were exclusively found under a specific treatment. Up to 160 different bacteria species were found - some of them for the first time in vineyard soils.

Three treatments were exposed to different concentrations of pure GLY (100, 1000, and 10,000 mu g g(-1), respectively), and there was also a control group. After the experimental time, liver and blood were analyzed. Melanomacrophages (MMCs) were located between the hepatocyte cordons, close to sinusoids. GLY increased the melanin area in MMCs of Leptodactylus latinasus exposed since lowest concentration until highest concentration. GLY also changed the occurrence of hepatic catabolism pigments into melanomacrophages and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities; therefore, it can interfere with the hepatic metabolism. In conclusion, GLY promotes alterations in the hepatic tissue and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities. Furthermore, MMCs may be useful as morphological responses of GLY effects.",2016,23,9852,9861,10.1007/s11356-016-6153-z
"Maqueda, C; Undabeytia, T; Villaverde, J; Morillo, E",Behaviour of glyphosate in a reservoir and the surrounding agricultural soils,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Glyphosate (GPS) is an herbicide currently used on olive crops in Spain, and can be transported to the nearby reservoirs currently used for human consumption. The purpose of this work was to study the behaviour and environmental fate of GPS in water and sediments of the Vibora Reservoir, its tributary river, and the surrounding agricultural soils to assess the risk of water pollution of this reservoir. The adsorption of GPS by different matrices was as follows: heading of the reservoir sediment (Cabecera) > tail sediment (Cola) > soils > Vibora sediment. The highest amount of oxides (especially Fe oxides) was observed in sediments from Cabecera and Cola whereas the lowest values were recorded on Vibora sediment. Results indicate that the highest GPS adsorption is due to the amorphous oxides and the edge sites of the clay minerals. Glyphosate adsorption increased with decreasing pH from 8 to 7. The desorption percentage of GPS from the four soils studied ranged only from 0.40 to 1.22%. Desorption was almost irreversible for Cabecera and Cola sediments, with values between 0 and 1.1%. Conversely, Vibora sediment presented about 20% desorption, probably due to its coarse texture and lower levels of amorphous oxides. Hockey-stick first-order kinetics was the best descriptor for water glyphosate dissipation at the Cabecera and Cola locations, and simple first-order kinetic for the water from the tributary Vibora River. The half-lives (DT50) were between 63 and 11.0 days. The rapid degradation of GPS in surface waters and its practically irreversible sorption on these soils and sediments implies that GPS use in similar agricultural areas is of very low environmental risk. This manuscript also outlines the importance of the presence of photo-sensitizers in waters in the degradation routes of GPS in reservoirs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Even though glyphosate is the herbicide most widely used in the world, increasing evidence indicates severe ecotoxicological effects on non-target organisms as native plants. The aim of this work is to determine glyphosate effects on 23 native species present in the remaining Chaco forests immersed in agricultural matrices. This is a laboratory/greenhouse approach studying acute effects on seedlings after 21 days. A gradient of glyphosate rates (525, 1050, 2100, 4200, and 8400 g ai/Ha; recommended field application rate (REAR) = 2100 g ai/Ha) was applied on four-week seedlings cultivated in a greenhouse and response variables (phytotoxicity, growth reduction, and sensitivity to the herbicide) were measured. This gradient of herbicide rates covers realistic rates of glyphosate applications in die crop field and also those that can reach vegetation of forest relicts by off-target drift and overspray. Testing was performed following guidelines for vegetative vigour (post-germination spray). All species showed lethal or sublethal effects after the application of the 25% of REAR (50% of species showed severe phytotoxicity or death and 70% of species showed growth reduction). The results showed a gradient of sensitivity to glyphosate by which some of the studied species are very sensitive to glyphosate and seedlings died with 25% of REAR while other species can be classified as herbicide-tolerant. Thus, the vegetation present in the forest relicts could be strongly affected by glyphosate application on crops. Lethal and sublethal effects of glyphosate on non-target plants could promote both the loss of biodiversity in native forest relicts immersed in the agroecosystems and the selection of new crop weeds considering that some biotypes are continuously exposed to low doses of glyphosate.",2017,144,360,368,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.049

Using published literature, the role of weeds in arable systems for other above-ground trophic levels are examined. In the UK, there is evidence that weed flora have changed over the past century, with some species declining in abundance, whereas others have increased. There is also some evidence for a decline in the size of arable weed seedbanks. Some of these changes reflect improved agricultural efficiency, changes to more winter-sown crops in arable rotations and the use of more broad-spectrum herbicide combinations. Interrogation of a database of records of phytophagous insects associated with plant species in the UK reveals that many arable weed species support a high diversity of insect species. Reductions in abundances of host plants may affect associated insects and other taxa. A number of insect groups and farmland birds have shown marked population declines over the past 30 years. Correlational studies indicate that many of these declines are associated with changes in agricultural practices. Certainly reductions in food availability in winter and for nestling birds in spring are implicated in the declines of several bird species, notably the grey partridge, Perdix perdix . Thus weeds have a role within agroecosystems in supporting biodiversity more generally. An understanding of weed competitivity and the importance of weeds for insects and birds may allow the identification of the most important weed species. This may form the first step in balancing the needs for weed control with the requirements for biodiversity and more sustainable production methods.",2003,43,77,89,10.1046/j.1365-3180.2003.00326.x

Many of the recent studies focus solely on the persistence of pesticides in soils, air, water or food products, or even on the degree of exposure of animals, since their potential hazards to human health have raised concerns. Given the unaware exposure of the general population to pesticides, and the absence of a significant number of studies on occupational hazards, new glyphosate-induced toxicity data obtained for both residual and acute doses should be analyzed and systematized. Additionally, recent studies also highlight the persistence and toxicity of both glyphosate metabolites and surfactants present in herbicide formulations. To renew or ban the use of glyphosate, recently published studies must be taken into account, aiming to define new levels of safety for exposure to herbicide, its metabolites, and the toxic excipients of its formulations.

It is unknown, however, whether unhatched worms exposed to TD during the egg stage show abnormal neurodevelopment post hatching. Therefore, we investigated whether early treatment with TD leads to aberrant neuronal or neurite development in C. elegans. Studies were completed in three different worm strains with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged neurons to facilitate visual neuronal assessment. Initially, eggs from C elegans with all neurons tagged with GFP were chronically exposed to TD. Visual inspection suggested decreased neurite projections associated with ventral nerve cord neurons. Data analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in overall green pixel numbers at the fourth larval (L4) stage (*p<0.05). We further investigated whether specific neuronal populations were preferentially vulnerable to TD by treating eggs from worms that had all dopaminergic (DAergic) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons tagged with GFP. As before, green pixel number associated with these discrete neuronal populations was analyzed at multiple larval stages. Data analysis indicated statistically significant decreases in pixel number associated with DAergic, but not GABAergic, neurons (***p<0.001) at all larval stages. Finally, statistically significant decreases (at the first larval stage, L1) or increases (at the fourth larval stage, L4) in superoxide levels, a developmental signaling molecule, were detected (*p<0.05). These data suggest that early exposure to TD may impair neuronal development, perhaps through superoxide perturbation. Since toxic insults during development may late render individuals more vulnerable to neurodegenerative diseases in adulthood, these studies provide some of the first evidence in this model organism that early exposure to TD may adversely affect the developing nervous system.

Toxic effects of POEA exposure are well documented for aquatic organisms, but despite the widespread occurrence of POEA in soils, the potential effects on soil bacteria have not been investigated. Here we examined the growth and metabolic effects of POEA in three strains of plant-beneficial soil Pseudomonas species (Pseudomonas putida KT2440, P. putida S12, and P. protegens Pf-5) grown on succinate, a common root exudate. Compared to the rate of growth on only succinate, the addition of POEA resulted in up to 60% reduction in the biomass growth rate. In the presence of both POEA and glyphosate, the biomass growth rate either remained the same as during exposure to only POEA or decreased by only an additional 5-15%, thus indicating that growth inhibition was primarily caused by POEA. Metabolomics analysis of POEA-exposed cells identified, relative to control cells, disruption of metabolite levels in key biosynthetic pathways: accumulation of ribonucleotides and depletion of amino acids. Kinetic C-13 flux experiments further revealed delayed de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides.

The declared active ingredient glyphosate does not only inhibit the EPSPS but is also a chelating agent that binds macro- and micronutrients, essential for many plant processes and pathogen resistance. GBH treatment may thus impede uptake and availability of macro- and micronutrients in plants. The present study investigated whether this characteristic of glyphosate could contribute to adverse effects of GBH application in the environment and to human health. According to the results, it has not been fully elucidated whether the chelating activity of glyphosate contributes to the toxic effects on plants and potentially on plant-microorganism interactions, e.g., nitrogen fixation of leguminous plants. It is also still open whether the chelating property of glyphosate is involved in the toxic effects on organisms other than plants, described in many papers. By changing the availability of essential as well as toxic metals that are bound to soil particles, the herbicide might also impact soil life, although the occurrence of natural chelators with considerably higher chelating potentials makes an additional impact of glyphosate for most metals less likely. Further research should elucidate the role of glyphosate (and GBH) as a chelator, in particular, as this is a non-specific property potentially affecting many organisms and processes. In the process of reevaluation of glyphosate its chelating activity has hardly been discussed.",2018,25,5298,5317,10.1007/s11356-017-1080-1

Caecum bacterial microbiota were evaluated by 16S rRNA sequencing whilst the fungal population was determined by ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Results showed that both fungal and bacterial diversity were affected by the Roundup formulations in a dose-dependent manner, whilst glyphosate alone significantly altered only bacterial diversity. At taxa level, a reduction in Bacteroidota abundance, marked by alterations in the levels of Alloprevotella, Prevotella and Prevotellaceae UCG-003, was concomitant to increased levels of Firmicutes (e.g., Romboutsia, Dubosiella, Eubacterium brachy group or Christensenellaceae) and Actinobacteria (e.g., Enterorhabdus, Adlercreutzia, or Asaccharobacter). Treponema and Mycoplasma also had their levels reduced by the pesticide treatments. Analysis of fungal composition indicated that the abundance of the rat gut commensal Ascomycota Kazachstania was reduced while the abundance of Gibberella, Penicillium, Claviceps, Cornuvesica, Candida, Trichoderma and Sarocladium were increased by exposure to the Roundup formulations, but not to glyphosate. Altogether, our data suggest that glyphosate and its Roundup RangerPro and Bioflow caused profound changes in caecum microbiome composition by affecting the fitness of major commensals, which in turn reduced competition and allowed opportunistic fungi to grow in the gut, in particular in animals exposed to the herbicide formulations. This further indicates that changes in gut microbiome composition might influence the long-term toxicity, carcinogenicity and multigenerational effects of glyphosate-based herbicides.",2022,13,,,10.3389/fmicb.2022.888853

As GBHs are more cytotoxic than glyphosate, we reasoned they may also be more capable of activating carcinogenic pathways. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of glyphosate with Roundup GBHs both in vitro and in vivo. First, glyphosate was compared with representative GBHs, namely MON 52276 (European Union), MON 76473 (United Kingdom), and MON 76207 (United States) using the mammalian stem cell-based ToxTracker system. Here, MON 52276 and MON 76473, but not glyphosate and MON 76207, activated oxidative stress and unfolded protein responses. Second, molecular profiling of liver was performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to glyphosate or MON 52276 (at 0.5, 50, and 175 mg/kg bw/day glyphosate) for 90 days. MON 52276 but not glyphosate increased hepatic steatosis and necrosis. MON 52276 and glyphosate altered the expression of genes in liver reflecting TP53 activation by DNA damage and circadian rhythm regulation. Genes most affected in liver were similarly altered in kidneys. Small RNA profiling in liver showed decreased amounts of miR-22 and miR-17 from MON 52276 ingestion. Glyphosate decreased miR-30, whereas miR-10 levels were increased. DNA methylation profiling of liver revealed 5727 and 4496 differentially methylated CpG sites between the control and glyphosate and MON 52276 exposed animals, respectively. Apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA damage formation in liver was increased with glyphosate exposure.

OBJECTIVES: We tested whether glyphosate or its representative EU herbicide formulation Roundup MON 52276 affects the rat gut microbiome. METHODS: We combined cecal microbiome shotgun metagenomics with serum and cecum metabolomics to assess the effects of glyphosate [0.5, 50, 175 mg=kg body weight oBW thorn per day] or MON 52276 at the same glyphosate-equivalent doses, in a 90-d toxicity test in rats. RESULTS: Glyphosate and MON 52276 treatment resulted in ceca accumulation of shikimic acid and 3-dehydroshikimic acid, suggesting inhibition of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase of the shikimate pathway in the gut microbiome. Cysteinylglycine, c-glutamylglutamine, and valylglycine levels were elevated in the cecal microbiome following glyphosate and MON 52276 treatments. Altered cecum metabolites were not differentially expressed in serum, suggesting that the glyphosate and MON 52276 impact on gut microbial metabolism had limited consequences on physiological biochemistry. Serum metabolites differentially expressed with glyphosate treatment were associated with nicotinamide, branched-chain amino acid, methionine, cysteine, and taurine metabolism, indicative of a response to oxidative stress. MON 52276 had similar, but more pronounced, effects than glyphosate on the serum metabolome. Shotgun metagenomics of the cecum showed that treatment with glyphosate and MON 52276 resulted in higher levels of Eggerthella spp., Shinella zoogleoides, Acinetobacter johnsonii, and Akkermansia muciniphila. Shinella zoogleoides was higher only with MON 52276 exposure. In vitro culture assays with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strains showed that Roundup GT plus inhibited growth at concentrations at which MON 52276 and glyphosate had no effect. DISCUSSION: Our study highlights the power of multi-omics approaches to investigate the toxic effects of pesticides. Multi-omics revealed that glyphosate and MON 52276 inhibited the shikimate pathway in the rat gut microbiome. Our findings could be used to develop biomarkers for epidemiologi cal studies aimed at evaluating the effects of glyphosate herbicides on humans. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6990",2021,129,,,10.1289/EHP6990
"Mesnage, R; Benbrook, C; Antoniou, MN",Insight into the confusion over surfactant co-formulants in glyphosate-based herbicides,FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate is the active ingredient in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEM were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are 100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted. Research to understand health implications from ingesting these substances is required.",2019,128,137,145,10.1016/j.fct.2019.03.053

Here, we focus on spiders as a model group of generalist predators. They are among the most abundant and most diverse natural enemies in agroecosystems. We review their functional traits that influence food-web dynamics and pest suppression at organisational levels ranging from individuals to communities. At the individual and population levels, we focus on hunting strategy, body size, life stage, nutritional target, and personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour). These functional traits determine the spider trophic niches. We also focus on the functional and numerical response to pest densities and on non-consumptive effects of spiders on pests. At the community level, we review multiple-predator effects and effect of alternative prey on pest suppression. Evidence for a key role of spiders in pest suppression is accumulating. Importantly, recent research has highlighted widespread non-consumptive effects and complex intraguild interactions of spiders.

"Mie, A; Rudén, C",What you don't know can still hurt you-under reporting in EU pesticide regulation,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,"The safety evaluation of pesticides in the European Union (EU) relies to a large extent on toxicity studies commissioned and funded by the industry. The herbicide glyphosate and four of its salts are currently under evaluation for renewed market approval in the EU. The safety documentation submitted by the applicant companies does not include any animal study regarding developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) that is compliant with test guidelines. For a fifth salt, not included in the present application for re-approval, such a DNT study was sponsored by one of the applicant companies in 2001. That study shows an effect of that form of glyphosate on a neurobehavioural function, motor activity, in rat offspring at a dose previously not known to cause adverse effects. Counter to regulatory requirements, these effects were apparently not communicated to authorities in EU countries where that form of glyphosate was authorised at that time. That DNT study may also be relevant for the ongoing assessment of glyphosate but was not included in the present or previous applications for re-approval. In this commentary, we highlight that it is the responsibility of the industry to evaluate and ensure the safety of their products, taking all available scientific knowledge into account. We argue that the legal obligation for industry to submit all potentially relevant data to EU authorities is clear and far-reaching, but that these obligations were not fulfilled in this case. We claim that authorities cannot reliably pursue a high level of protection of human health, if potentially relevant evidence is withheld from them. We suggest that a retrospective cross-check of lists of studies performed by test laboratories against studies submitted to regulatory authorities should be performed, in order to investigate the completeness of data submitted to authorities. We further suggest that future toxicity studies should be commissioned by authorities rather than by companies, to improve the authorities' oversight over existing data and to prevent that economic conflicts of interest affect the reporting of study results and conclusions.",2022,21,,,10.1186/s12940-022-00891-7

Here, we investigated whether perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH alters the female reproductive performance, and/or induced second-generation effects related to congenital anomalies or growth alterations. Pregnant rats (F0) received a GBH through food, in a dose of 2 mg (GBH-LD: GBH-low dose group) or 200 mg (GBH-HD: GBH-high dose group) of glyphosate/kg bw/day from gestational day (GD) 9 until weaning. Body weight gain and vaginal canal-opening of F1 females were recorded. Sexually mature F1 females were mated to evaluate their reproductive performance by assessing the pregnancy rate, and on GD19, the number of corpora lutea, the implantation sites (IS) and resorption sites. To analyze second-generation effects on F2 offspring, we analyzed the fetal morphology on GD19, and assessed the fetal length and weight, and the placental weight. GBH exposure neither altered the body weight gain of F1 females, nor vaginal opening onset. Although all GBH-exposed F1 rats became pregnant, a lower number of IS was detected. F2 offspring from both GBH groups showed delayed growth, evidenced by lower fetal weight and length, associated with a higher incidence of small for gestational age fetuses. In addition, higher placental weight and placental index were found in F2 offspring from GBH-HD dams. Surprisingly, structural congenital anomalies (conjoined fetuses and abnormally developed limbs) were detected in the F2 offspring from GBH-HD group. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH impaired female reproductive performance and induced fetal growth retardation and structural congenital anomalies in F2 offspring.",2018,92,2629,2643,10.1007/s00204-018-2236-6

Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup (R) to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22 mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32 mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96 h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians. These study results suggest that anurans are among the most sensitive species, and emphasize the importance of testing the herbicide formulation in addition to its separate components to accurately characterize the toxicity and potential risk of the formulation.

These effects have been associated with both glyphosate and co-formulants, but it is still unknown whether they translate to other bee species. In this study, we tested whether glyphosate, pure or in herbicide formulation, can affect the gut microbiota and survival rates of the eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. We performed mark-recapture experiments with bumble bee workers from four different commercial colonies, which were exposed to field relevant concentrations of glyphosate or a glyphosate-based formulation (0.01 mM to 1 mM). After a 5-day period of exposure, we returned the bees to their original colonies, and they were sampled at days 0, 3 and 7 post-exposure to investigate changes in microbial community and microbiota resilience by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. We found that exposure to glyphosate, pure or in herbicide formulation, reduced the relative abundance of a beneficial bee gut bacterium, Snodgrassella, in bees from two of four colonies when compared to control bees at day 0 post-exposure, but this reduction became non-significant at days 3 and 7 post-exposure, suggesting microbiota resilience. We did not find significant changes in total bacteria between control and exposed bees. Moreover, we observed an overall trend in decreased survival rates in bumble bees exposed to 1 mM herbicide formulation during the 7-day postexposure period, suggesting a potential negative effect of this formulation on bumble bees.",2023,872,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162102
"Motta, EVS; Powell, JE; Moran, NA",Glyphosate induces immune dysregulation in honey bees,ANIMAL MICROBIOME,"Background Similar to many other animals, the honey bee Apis mellifera relies on a beneficial gut microbiota for regulation of immune homeostasis. Honey bees exposed to agrochemicals, such as the herbicide glyphosate or antibiotics, usually exhibit dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Considering the relevance of the microbiota-immunity axis for host health, we hypothesized that glyphosate exposure could potentially affect other components of the honey bee physiology, such as the immune system. Results In this study, we investigated whether glyphosate, besides affecting the gut microbiota, could compromise two components of honey bee innate immunity: the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (humoral immunity) and the melanization pathway (cellular immunity). We also compared the effects of glyphosate on the bee immune system with those of tylosin, an antibiotic commonly used in beekeeping. We found that both glyphosate and tylosin decreased the expression of some antimicrobial peptides, such as apidaecin, defensin and hymenoptaecin, in exposed honey bees, but only glyphosate was able to inhibit melanization in the bee hemolymph. Conclusions Exposure of honey bees to glyphosate or tylosin can reduce the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria and lead to immune dysregulation.",2022,4,,,10.1186/s42523-022-00165-0

Environmental stressors that affect the bee gut microbial community, such as antibiotics and glyphosate, can indirectly compromise bee health. Most of the experiments demonstrating these effects have been done under laboratory conditions with pure chemicals. Here, we investigated the oral and topical effects of various concentrations of glyphosate in a herbicide formulation on the honey bee gut microbiota and health under laboratory and field conditions. Under all of these conditions, the formulation, dissolved in sucrose syrup or water, affected the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the bee gut in a dose-dependent way. Mark-recapture experiments also demonstrated that bees exposed to the formulation were more likely to disappear from the colony, once reintroduced after exposure. Although no visible effects were observed for hives exposed to the formulation in field experiments, challenge trials with the pathogen Serratia marcescens, performed under laboratory conditions, revealed that bees from hives exposed to the formulation exhibited increased mortality compared with bees from control hives. In the field experiments, glyphosate was detected in honey collected from exposed hives, showing that worker bees transfer xenobiotics to the hive, thereby extending exposure and increasing the chances of exposure to recently emerged bees. These findings show that different routes of exposure to glyphosate-based herbicide can affect honey bees and their gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE The honey bee gut microbial community plays a vital role in immune response and defense against opportunistic pathogens. Environmental stressors, such as the herbicide glyphosate, may affect the gut microbiota, with negative consequences for bee health. Glyphosate is usually sprayed in the field mixed with adjuvants, which enhance herbicidal activity. These adjuvants may also enhance undesired effects in nontargeted organisms. This seems to be the case for glyphosate-based herbicide on honey bees. As we show in this study, oral exposure to either pure glyphosate or glyphosate in a commercial herbicide formulation perturbs the gut microbiota of honey bees, and topical exposure to the formulation also has a direct effect on honey bee health, increasing mortality in a dose-dependent way and leaving surviving bees with a perturbed microbiota. Understanding the effects of herbicide formulations on honey bees may help to protect these important agricultural pollinators.",2020,86,,,10.1128/AEM.01150-20
"Motta, EVS; Moran, NA","Impact of Glyphosate on the Honey Bee Gut Microbiota: Effects of Intensity, Duration, and Timing of Exposure",MSYSTEMS,"Exposure to anthropogenic chemicals may indirectly compromise animal health by perturbing the gut microbiota. For example, the widely used herbicide glyphosate can affect the microbiota of honey bees, reducing the abundance of beneficial bacterial species that contribute to immune regulation and pathogen resistance. Previous studies have not addressed how this impact depends on concentration, duration of exposure, or stage of microbiota establishment. Worker bees acquire their microbiota from nestmates early in adult life, when they can also be exposed to chemicals collected by foragers or added to the hives. Here, we investigated how the gut microbiota of honey bees is affected by different concentrations of glyphosate and compared the effects with those caused by tylosin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat hives. We treated newly emerged workers at the stage at which they acquire the microbiota and also workers with established gut microbiota. Treatments consisted of exposure to sucrose syrup containing glyphosate in concentrations ranging from 0.01 mM to 1.0 mM or tylosin at 0.1 mM. Based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) determination of abundances, glyphosate perturbed the gut microbiota of honey bees regardless of age or period of exposure. Snodgrassella alvi was the most affected bacterial species and responded to glyphosate in a dose-dependent way. Tylosin also perturbed the microbiota, especially at the stage of acquisition, and the effects differed sharply from the effects of glyphosate. These findings show that sublethal doses of glyphosate (0.04 to 1.0 mM) and tylosin (0.1 mM) affect the microbiota of honey bees. IMPORTANCE As is true of many animal species, honey bees depend on their gut microbiota for health. The bee gut microbiota has been shown to regulate the host immune system and to protect against pathogenic diseases, and disruption of the normal microbiota leads to increased mortality. Understanding these effects can give broad insights into vulnerabilities of gut communities, and, in the case of honey bees, could provide information useful for promoting the health of these economically critical insects, which provide us with crop pollination services as well as honey and other products. The bee gut microbiota is acquired early in adult life and can be compromised by antibiotics and other chemicals. The globally used weed killer glyphosate was previously found to impact the gut microbiota of honey bees following sustained exposure. In the present study, we address how this impact depends on concentration, duration of exposure, and stage of community establishment. We found that sublethal doses of glyphosate reduce the abundance of beneficial bacteria and affect microbial diversity in the guts of honey bees, regardless of whether exposure occurs during or after microbiota acquisition. We also compared the effects of glyphosate to those of tylosin, an antibiotic used in beekeeping, and observed that tylosin effects diverge from those caused by glyphosate and are greater during microbiota acquisition. Such perturbations are not immediately lethal to bees but, depending on exposure level, can decrease survivorship under laboratory conditions.",2020,5,,,10.1128/mSystems.00268-20
"Motta, EVS; Raymann, K; Moran, NA",Glyphosate perturbs the gut microbiota of honey bees,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Glyphosate, the primary herbicide used globally for weed control, targets the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme in the shikimate pathway found in plants and some microorganisms. Thus, glyphosate may affect bacterial symbionts of animals living near agricultural sites, including pollinators such as bees. The honey bee gut microbiota is dominated by eight bacterial species that promote weight gain and reduce pathogen susceptibility. The gene encoding EPSPS is present in almost all sequenced genomes of bee gut bacteria, indicating that they are potentially susceptible to glyphosate. We demonstrated that the relative and absolute abundances of dominant gut microbiota species are decreased in bees exposed to glyphosate at concentrations documented in the environment. Glyphosate exposure of young workers increased mortality of bees subsequently exposed to the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens. Members of the bee gut microbiota varied in susceptibility to glyphosate, largely corresponding to whether they possessed an EPSPS of class I (sensitive to glyphosate) or class II (insensitive to glyphosate). This basis for differences in sensitivity was confirmed using in vitro experiments in which the EPSPS gene from bee gut bacteria was cloned into Escherichia coli. All strains of the core bee gut species, Snodgrassella alvi, encode a sensitive class I EPSPS, and reduction in S. alvi levels was a consistent experimental result. However, some S. alvi strains appear to possess an alternative mechanism of glyphosate resistance. Thus, exposure of bees to glyphosate can perturb their beneficial gut microbiota, potentially affecting bee health and their effectiveness as pollinators.",2018,115,10305,10310,10.1073/pnas.1803880115

Studies are often one-dimensional as the majority examine glyphosate by itself. Farmers and the public use commercial products, like Roundup, containing a myriad of chemicals in addition to glyphosate. Currently, there are no neurological targets proposed for glyphosate and little comparison to Roundup. To investigate this, we compared how glyphosate and Roundup affect convulsant behavior in C.elegans and found that glyphosate and Roundup increased seizure-like behavior. Key to our initial hypothesis, we found that treatment with an antiepileptic drug rescued the prolonged convulsions. We also discovered over a third of nematodes exposed to Roundup did not recover from their convulsions, but drug treatment resulted in full recovery. Notably, these effects were found at concentrations that are 1,000-fold dilutions of previous findings of neurotoxicity, using over 300-fold less herbicide than the lowest concentration recommended for consumer use. Exploring mechanisms behind our observations, we found significant evidence that glyphosate targets GABA-A receptors. Pharmacological experiments which paired subeffective dosages of glyphosate and a GABA-A antagonist yielded a 24% increase in non-recovery compared to the antagonist alone. GABA mutant strain experiments showed no effect in a GABA-A depleted strain, but a significant, increased effect in a glutamic acid decarboxylase depleted strain. Our findings characterize glyphosate's exacerbation of convulsions and propose the GABA-A receptor as a neurological target for the observed physiological changes. It also highlights glyphosate's potential to dysregulate inhibitory neurological circuits.",2022,12,,,10.1038/s41598-022-17537-w

With the advent of glyphosate tolerant (GT) cropping more than 10 years ago, there is now concern for non-target effects on soil microbial communities that has potential to negatively affect soil functions, plant health, and crop productivity. Although extensive research has been done on short-term response to glyphosate, relatively little information is available on long-term effects. Therefore, the overall objective was to investigate shifts in the rhizosphere bacterial community following long-term glyphosate application on GT corn and soybean in the greenhouse. In this study, rhizosphere soil was sampled from rhizoboxes following 4 growth periods, and bacterial community composition was compared between glyphosate treated and untreated rhizospheres using next-generation barcoded sequencing. In the presence or absence of glyphosate, corn and soybean rhizospheres were dominated by members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria (particularly gammaproteobacteria) increased in relative abundance for both crops following glyphosate exposure, and the relative abundance of Acidobocteria decreased in response to glyphosate exposure. Given that some members of the Acidobacteria are involved in biogeochemical processes, a decrease in their abundance could lead to significant changes in nutrient status of the rhizosphere. Our results also highlight the need for applying culture-independent approaches in studying the effects of pesticides on the soil and rhizosphere microbial community. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, studies on the effects of GBH formulations on specific non-rhizosphere soil microbial species are scarce. We evaluated the toxicity of a commercial formulation of RoundupA (R) (R450), containing 450 g/L of glyphosate (GLY), on the soil filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, an experimental model microorganism. The median lethal dose (LD50) on solid media was between 90 and 112 mg/L GLY (among adjuvants, which are also included in the RoundupA (R) formulation), which corresponds to a dilution percentage about 100 times lower than that used in agriculture. The LOAEL and NOAEL (lowest- and no-observed-adverse-effect levels) associated to morphology and growth were 33.75 and 31.5 mg/L GLY among adjuvants, respectively. The formulation R450 proved to be much more active than technical GLY. At the LD50 and lower concentrations, R450 impaired growth, cellular polarity, endocytosis, and mitochondria (average number, total volume and metabolism). In contrast with the depletion of mitochondrial activities reported in animal studies, R450 caused a stimulation of mitochondrial enzyme activities, thus revealing a different mode of action of RoundupA (R) on energetic metabolism. These mitochondrial disruptions were also evident at a low dose corresponding to the NOAEL for macroscopic parameters, indicating that these mitochondrial biomarkers are more sensitive than those for growth and morphological ones.

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R), and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Field and laboratory screening tests to risk assessment,CHEMOSPHERE,"Despite glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in agriculture, forestry and gardens, little is known about its effects on non-target organisms. The present work evaluated the ecotoxicity of four formulated products (Roundup (R) Original, Trop (R), Zapp (R) Qi 620 and Crucial (R)) on soil invertebrates. Screening ecotoxicity tests were carried out with soil and oat straw collected in a field experiment, besides laboratory spiked soils. Screening tests included avoidance behaviour of earthworms (Eisenia andrei), collembolans (Folsomia candida) and isopods (Porcellio dilatatus) in single and multispecies tests; reproduction of collembolans (F. candida), and bait lamina in field. Non-avoidance behaviour was observed in standard tests (earthworms) in soil, neither in multispecies tests (earthworm + isopods) using oat straw, while for collembolans it occurred for the product Zapp (R) Qj 620 even at the recommended dose. Reproduction of E candida was not impaired even at high doses in laboratory-spiked soils. Feeding activity on bait lamina test was impaired in treatment corresponding to the red label product, Crucial (R). Results showed the relevance of bait lamina test on screening the impact of herbicides in the field. The findings highlight the importance of considering different formulations for the same active ingredient in risk assessment of pesticides. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Even so, the individual and combined non-target effects of N fertilizers and herbicides on multitrophic interactions within agrosystems are not well known. From soil samples collected in the field, we examined the effects of the direct application of glyphosate and/or N fertilization on microbial activities and soil nutrient status. In addition, we investigated the increase in biomass and, nutrient acquisition of the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the consequences of the applications of N and glyphosate on the performance of the herbivore aphid (Aphis fabae). From soils that did (N +) or did not receive (NO) synthetic N fertilization over a 6-year period, we assessed the effects of glyphosate (CK, without glyphosate; FR, field rate of glyphosate) and N fertilization (N +, with N fertilization; NO, without N fertilization) applications in a mesocosm experiment for 75-days. Following the 75 day treatment, the biological and physiological consequences, both belowground and aboveground were determined. The growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dehydrogenase activity, were negatively affected following N + fertilization and the application of the FR of glyphosate, while in the absence of glyphosate, alkaline phosphatase (AIP) activity was reduced. Functional microbial responses were unaffected by both. N and glyphosate, even when applied in combination. Conversely, the N fertilization significantly increased the nitrate content (NO3-) in,the CK soils and the total N in the FR soils, compared to CK/NO and FR/NO soils. The combined effects of glyphosate and nitrogen fertilization (FR/N +) significantly decreased the soil C:N ratio, but significantly increased nitrification compared to CK/NO and FR/NO soils. The FR/N + treatments positively affected plant performance, improving the total chlorophyll, sucrose, ammonium, amino acid content, and pod biomass, compared to the CK/NO and FR/NO soils. Unlike glyphosate, which did not appear to exert an effect when applied alone or in combination, N fertilization significantly increased aphid nymph survival. The non-metric multidimensional scale allowed us to establish belowground and aboveground interactions with glyphosate and N fertilization. We conclude that glyphosate and N fertilization have negative effects on soil microflora and potential pests, but do not necessarily affect belowground and aboveground interactions, and may offer equal or superior benefits to crop productivity.",2018,311,45,57,10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.002

The experiment simulated post-harvest conditions in no-till cereal cultivation, where L. terrestris often abound, and glyphosate is widely used. Pairs of adult, field-collected L. terrestris (median total mass 11.2 g fresh weight) were kept in fine sand-filled cylinders, with chopped wheat straw on the soil surface as feed. The treatment cylinders were sprayed with glyphosate at normal field application rate [Rodeo (R) XL 3.0 1 ha(-1), resulting in 1080 g a.i. ha(-1) and Contact surfactant (0.51 ha(-1))]; the controls were sprayed with water (N = 12 for both). The treatment and control cylinders were maintained for two months at + 15 degrees C, approximate 60% air humidity and 12h:12h light:dark cycle. All individuals survived the experiment. There was no difference in L. terrestris mass change over the experiment, with an average weight change of + 0.96% in glyphosate treatment and -0.93% change in the control (p = 0.66). Glyphosate treatment and control did not differ in cocoon production rate (31 vs 28 cocoons cylinder(-1) respectively; p = 0.30). The straw incorporation was slightly but not significantly lower in glyphosate-treated soil (decline in surface straw mass 27.5% vs. 30.5%; p = 0.07). The glyphosate treatment applied represents a commonly used practice in spring cereal cultivation, and it did not affect negatively L. terrestris.

In such areas the pesticide Roundup Full II (R) (RU) is widely applied. The genotoxic effect of its active ingredient glyphosate (RU is 66.2% glyphosate) on the peripheral blood lymphocytes of C. villosus was tested over a range of concentrations (280, 420, 560, 1120 mu mol/L). Culture medium without glyphosate served as negative control, while medium containing mitomycin C served as positive control. Genetic damage was characterized in terms of the percentage of cells with chromosome aberrations (CA), the mean number of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) per cell, and the modification of cell proliferation kinetics via the calculation of the replication index. Significant increases (p < 0.0001) were seen in the CA frequency and the mean number of SCEs per cell compared to negative controls at all the RU concentrations tested. Chromatid breaks, the only form of CA observed, under the 560 mu mol/L RU conditions and in presence of mitomycin C were four to five times more common than at lower concentrations, while no viable cells were seen in the 1120 mu mol/L treatment.

"Panettieri, M; Lazaro, L; López-Garrido, R; Murillo, JM; Madejón, E",Glyphosate effect on soil biochemical properties under conservation tillage,SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH,"In conservation tillage (CT) the use of herbicides is often required. Glyphosate (C3H8NO5P, N-phosphonomethylglycine) is one of the most used herbicides. Since biochemical parameters are often used as soil quality indexes, the stimulation effects on these indexes induced by CT could be misinterpreted due to the required application of herbicide. The objective of this work was to establish the effect of glyphosate on soil biochemical parameters and how long did these effects last on a sandy clay loam Entisol in SW Spain under different tillages. To test the hypothesis that glyphosate could lead to an erroneous evaluation of biochemical parameters when different tillages are compared, two experiments were carried out in 2011: (i) the first one was conducted under incubation conditions; no-tillage (NT) and reduced tillage (RT) pots with and without herbicide addition were compared, after sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) sowing, during 101 days; (ii) in the second one, samples were directly collected from an experimental farm after wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sowing; NT and RT soil samples where glyphosate was applied were compared for 60 days with plots under traditional tillage in the absence of glyphosate. Biochemical parameters such as water soluble carbon (WSC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), as well as dehydrogenase (DHA) and beta-glucosidase (beta-Glu) activities were analyzed in both experiments. Results showed that glyphosate acted as a source of organic carbon in both experiments, however, stimulation effects on MBC, MBN, DHA and beta-Glu were more evident and lasted longer for the incubated samples. In this experiment, the maximum values for MBC, MBN and DHA were registered between 18 and 37 days after application, while higher beta-Glu values under reduced tillage were still registered after 101 days. Those effects were less noticeable in the on-field experiment. Under our experimental conditions (Entisol, Mediterranean condition, rainfed agriculture, wheat-sunflower-fodder pea rotation), an interval of at least 30 days between glyphosate application and soil sampling should be adopted as a standard to avoid data misinterpretation. Differences in glyphosate metabolism are expected for different conditions and crops and should be evaluated case by case. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since the large number of contaminants makes it impossible to perform ecotoxicity tests for each potential mixture, a robust approach for prospective environmental risk assessment of chemical mixtures is needed. A number of recent publications by the European Commission and the authorities in charge prove the increasing interest that is spreading in the European community towards the topic of the assessment of chemical mixtures. The current EU regulation for Plant Protection Products authorization (Reg. 1107/2009 EC) explicitly requires the evaluation of the potential combined effects of active substances. We reviewed current methods and limitations of mixture assessment of pesticides (7 fungicides and 4 herbicides) through the analysis of the approaches adopted to investigate possible risks for different non-target organisms. The Concentration Addition (CA) approach was the most used approach to predict multiple toxicity to non-target organisms. The guidance for birds and mammals first introduced standard procedures to assess the multiple toxicity based on on CA concept The recent aquatic EFSA guidance introduced some requirements to evaluate potential mixture toxicity, while the current guidance requirements for terrestrial organisms still lack clear indications on how to conduct the assessment Moreover, new indications come from the draft guidance for the assessment of terrestrial plants and in-soil organisms. However, the approval and implementation of these new guidelines are still at a developmental stage. Some final considerations are drawn on the future possibilities to improve risk assessment procedures so as to identify harmful effects of pesticides mixtures on non-target organisms.

The massive and increasing use of GBHs results in not only the global burden of occupational exposures, but also increased exposure to the general population. The current pilot study represents the first phase of a long-term investigation of GBHs that we are conducting over the next 5 years. In this paper, we present the study design, the first evaluation of in vivo parameters and the determination of glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in urine. Methods: We exposed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats orally via drinking water to a dose of glyphosate equivalent to the United States Acceptable Daily Intake (US ADI) of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, defined as the chronic Reference Dose (cRfD) determined by the US EPA, starting from prenatal life, i.e. gestational day (GD) 6 of their mothers. One cohort was continuously dosed until sexual maturity (6-week cohort) and another cohort was continuously dosed until adulthood (13-week cohort). Here we present data on general toxicity and urinary concentrations of glyphosate and its major metabolite AMPA. Results: Survival, body weight, food and water consumption of the animals were not affected by the treatment with either glyphosate or Roundup. The concentration of both glyphosate and AMPA detected in the urine of SD rats treated with glyphosate were comparable to that observed in animals treated with Roundup, with an increase in relation to the duration of treatment. The majority of glyphosate was excreted unchanged. Urinary levels of the parent compound, glyphosate, were around 100-fold higher than the level of its metabolite, AMPA. Conclusions: Glyphosate concentrations in urine showed that most part of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged parent compound upon glyphosate and Roundup exposure, with an increasing pattern of glyphosate excreted in urine in relation to the duration of treatment The adjuvants and the other substances present in Roundup did not seem to exert a major effect on the absorption and excretion of glyphosate.

Its utilization in broad-spectrum herbicides, such as RoundUp(R), has continued to increase since 1974; glyphosate, as well as its primary metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid, is measured in soils, water, plants, animals and food. In humans, glyphosate is detected in blood and urine, especially in exposed workers, and is excreted within a few days. It has long been regarded as harmless in animals, but growing literature has reported health risks associated with glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides. In 2017, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic in humans. However, other national agencies did not tighten their glyphosate restrictions and even prolonged authorizations of its use. There are also discrepancies between countries' authorized levels, demonstrating an absence of a clear consensus on glyphosate to date. This review details the effects of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides on fish and mammal health, focusing on the immune system. Increasing evidence shows that glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides exhibit cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, increase oxidative stress, disrupt the estrogen pathway, impair some cerebral functions, and allegedly correlate with some cancers. Glyphosate effects on the immune system appear to alter the complement cascade, phagocytic function, and lymphocyte responses, and increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in fish. In mammals, including humans, glyphosate mainly has cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, causes inflammation, and affects lymphocyte functions and the interactions between microorganisms and the immune system. Importantly, even as many outcomes are still being debated, evidence points to a need for more studies to better decipher the risks from glyphosate and better regulation of its global utilization.",2020,17,163,174,10.1080/1547691X.2020.1804492
"Pelosi, C; Joimel, S; Makowski, D",Searching for a more sensitive earthworm species to be used in pesticide homologation tests - A meta-analysis,CHEMOSPHERE,"Pesticide risk assessments include experiments designed to measure the effect of pesticides on earthworms using the Eisenia fetida fetida or Eisenia fetida andrei species. There is no clear consensus in the literature on the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. We performed a meta-analysis on the sensitivity of several earthworm species to pesticides to determine the most sensitive species, and to discuss their suitability for European homologation tests. A dataset including median lethal dose (LC50) values reported in 44 experimental treatments was constructed and then analyzed in order to compare the sensitivity levels of E. fetida with that of other earthworm species. Results showed that LC50 values reported for Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea caliginosa were on average significantly lower than for E. fetida. Considering the relatively high LC50 values reported for E. fetida and the absence of this species from zones where pesticides are usually applied, the relevance of using E. fetida for pesticide homologation tests is questionable and we advise risk assessors to use A. caliginosa as model species. A new protocol based on this species could be proposed for European homologation tests but its implementation will require the definition of a new standard and take time. In the meantime, the results obtained with E. fetida should be interpreted with caution taking into account the low sensitivity of this species. Our study illustrates the value of the meta-analysis approach for comparing the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. It would be useful to extend the dataset presented in this paper in order to analyze the sensitivity of other aquatic or terrestrial organism groups used for pesticide homologation or ecotoxicology tests.

A review,AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,"Earthworms provide key soil functions that favour many positive ecosystem services. These services are important for agroecosystem sustainability but can be degraded by intensive cultural practices such as use of pesticides. Many literature reports have investigated the effect of pesticides on earthworms. Here, we review those reports to assess the relevance of the indicators of earthworm response to pesticides, to assess their sensitivity to pesticides, and to highlight the remaining knowledge gaps. We focus on European earthworm species and products authorised in Europe, excluding natural compounds and metals. We consider different organisation levels: the infra-individual level (gene expression and physiology), the individual and population levels (life-history traits, population density and behaviour) and the community level: community biomass and density. Our analysis shows that earthworms are impacted by pesticides at all organisation levels. For example, pesticides disrupt enzymatic activities, increase individual mortality, decrease fecundity and growth, change individual behaviour such as feeding rate and decrease the overall community biomass and density. Insecticides and fungicides are the most toxic pesticides impacting survival and reproduction, respectively.",2014,34,199,228,10.1007/s13593-013-0151-z

Since there is little information about the interactions between these pesticides, the aim of this study was to evaluate the single and joint lethal toxicity of the glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) ATANOR (R) (43.8% of glyphosate, isopropylamine salt) and the 2,4-D-based herbicide (2,4-DBH) Asi Max 50 (R) (602000 mg/L of 2,4-D) on Rhinella arenarum larvae. Equitoxic and non-equitoxic mixtures were prepared according to the recommendation for their combination and analyzed with a fixed ratio design at different exposure times and levels of lethality (LC10, LC50, and LC90). GBH (504h-LC50=38.67 mg ae/L) was significantly more toxic than 2,4-DBH (504h-LC50=250.31 mg ae/L) and their toxicity was time-dependent. At 48h, the equitoxic mixture toxicity was additive and from the 96h was antagonistic at LC10 and LC50 effect level. The non-equitoxic mixture toxicity was additive at LC10 effect level from the 48h to the 168h, and synergistic from the 240h. At LC50 and LC90 effect level, the mixture interaction resulted synergistic for all exposure times. This is the first study to report the synergistic interactions between GBH and 2,4-DBH on amphibians, alerting about its negative impact on aquatic ecosystems.",2022,29,14443,14452,10.1007/s11356-021-16784-0

However, studies on the effects of glyphosate-based formulations on terrestrial receptors are scarce. This study was conducted to evaluate the comparative toxicity of two glyphosate-based products: Roundup FG (monoammonium salt, 72% acid equivalent, glyphosate-A) and Mon 8750 (monoammonium salt, 85.4% acid equivalent, glyphosate-B), towards the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Median lethal concentration (LC50) showed that glyphosate-A was 4.5-fold more toxic than glyphosate-B. Sublethal concentrations caused a concentration-dependent weight loss, consistent with the reported effect of glyphosate as uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Glyphosate-A showed deleterious effects on DNA and lysosomal damage at concentrations close to the applied environmental concentrations (14.4 mu g ae cm(-2)). With glyphosate-B toxic effects were observed at higher doses, close to its LC50, suggesting that the higher toxicity of formulate A could be attributed to the effects of some of the so-called inert ingredients, either due to a direct intrinsic toxicity, or to an enhancement in the bioavailability and/or bioaccumulation of the active ingredient. Our results highlight the importance of ecotoxicological assessment not only of the active ingredients, but also of the different formulations usually employed in agricultural practices.

Despite the observed decline in the monarch population as measured at overwintering sites in Mexico, these studies found no decline in summer counts in the Midwest, the core of the summer breeding range, leading to a suggestion that the cause of the monarch population decline is not the loss of Midwest agricultural milkweeds but increased mortality during the fall migration. Using these counts to estimate population size, however, does not account for the shift of monarch activity from agricultural fields to non-agricultural sites over the past 20 years, as a result of the loss of agricultural milkweeds due to the nearubiquitous use of glyphosate herbicides. We present the counter-hypotheses that the proportion of the monarch population present in non-agricultural habitats, where counts are made, has increased and that counts reflect both population size and the proportion of the population observed. We use data on the historical change in the proportion of milkweeds, and thus monarch activity, in agricultural fields and non-agricultural habitats to show why using counts can produce misleading conclusions about population size. We then separate out the shifting proportion effect from the counts to estimate the population size and show that these corrected summer monarch counts show a decline over time and are correlated with the size of the overwintering population. In addition, we present evidence against the hypothesis of increased mortality during migration. The milkweed limitation hypothesis for monarch decline remains supported and conservation efforts focusing on adding milkweeds to the landscape in the summer breeding region have a sound scientific basis.",2017,12,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0181245

While multiple studies have documented the toxicity, environmental persistence, and tendency to spread for glyphosate and Roundup (R), few studies have compared the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations to the toxicity of pure glyphosate for soil invertebrates, which contact both the herbicide and the formulations. Hundreds of formulations exist; their inert ingredients are confidential; and glyphosate persists in our food, water, and soil. In this experiment, we held glyphosate type and concentration constant, varying only formulation. Using Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R), Roundup Super Concentrate (R), and pure glyphosate, we delivered 26.3 mg glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt per kg of soil to compost worms (Eisenia fetida). We found that worms living in soil spiked with pure glyphosate lost 14.8-25.9% of their biomass and survived a stress test for 22.2-333% less time than worms living in uncontaminated soil. Worms living in soil spiked with Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R) and Roundup Super Concentrate (R) did not lose body mass and survived the stress test as well as worms living in uncontaminated soil. No contaminant affected soil microbial or fungal biomass over the 40-day period of this experiment. We suggest that the nitrates and phosphates in the formulations offset the toxic effects of glyphosate by spurring microbial growth and speeding glyphosate degradation. We also found a 26.5-41.3% reduction in fungal biomass across all treatments over the course of this experiment, suggesting that the worms consumed fungi and spores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A full literature review shows negative, positive, and non-significant impacts on a suite of outcomes. Pilot studies from our lab have produced similar inconsistencies. This study aimed to determine which factors drive earthworm sensitivity to Roundup-Ready-To-Use III (R), a popular herbicide. Taking cues from literature and our pilot work, we examined the effects of soil temperature, initial earthworm body mass, and the interaction between the two on a) final earthworm mass after a month of exposure to contamination and b) survival time during a stress test. We found that both earthworm responses varied with intrinsic worm characteristics (e.g. initial body mass) and environmental characteristics (e.g. soil temperature). Specifically, only initially heavy worms grown in heated soil responded to contamination, and they responded by growing significantly heavier than their uncontaminated counterparts. Worms of lighter mass and worms grown in a cooler temperature did not respond to contamination by altering final body mass. Additionally, earthworms living in unheated soil survived significantly fewer minutes during the stress test, with herbicide-exposed worms surviving the shortest number of minutes overall. Initial earthworm body mass did not affect the outcome of this test. This study shows that by varying initial body condition and soil temperature, earthworms can respond positively, negatively or not at all to exposure to a glyphosate-based formulation. Earthworm sensitivity varies with specific environmental and somatic conditions, and this may explain variation in published literature, where neither initial earthworm body mass nor soil temperature is generally considered.",2019,139,32,39,10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.03.015

When exposed to Roundup formulations and glyphosate, worms endure a suite of sublethal changes, potentially impacting their ability to provide ecosystem services. Roundup applications also impact soil microbes, which aid soil in delivering ecosystem services. The experiment described here sought to establish the length of time needed between herbicide application and earthworm and soil microbe recovery. We found that exposing worms and soil microbes to a Roundup formulation commonly used in urban settings, at about twice the recommended dose, did not impact earthworm mortality or body mass. However, worms significantly decreased their stress-test survival time, and soil microbes significantly declined in biomass after exposure. While worms demonstrated the strongest decline one-week post exposure, and soil microbes demonstrated the strongest decline two-weeks post exposure, both worms and soil microbes recovered by the third week.

In at least one ectotherm, females of the New Zealand common gecko, Hoplodactylus maculatus, this variation in baseline ( not stress-induced) corticosterone appears to be correlated with variation in body temperature (T-b). We tested the hypothesis that elevated corticosterone affects thermoregulatory behavior so as to raise T-b and that, independently of an increase in T-b, corticosterone increases metabolic rate. Compared with geckos receiving placebo implants, those that received implants containing corticosterone displayed heat-seeking behaviors, had a higher mean T-b in their home cages, and, at one time of day, selected a higher mean T-b in a thermal gradient. At a constant T-b, corticosterone-treated geckos consumed oxygen at a rate approximately 50% higher than placebo geckos. This work has far-reaching implications for a variety of physiological and ecological processes in ectotherms and suggests that corticosterone should be considered as a variable influencing T-b and metabolism in future studies.",2008,81,641,650,10.1086/590371

The present study was aimed to evaluate the occurrence and concentration of the herbicide and its main metabolite (AMPA) in soil and other environmental compartments of the mentioned agroecosystem, including groundwater, in relation to real-world agricultural management practices in the region. Occurrence was almost ubiquitous in solid matrices (83 -100%) with maximum concentrations among the higher reported in the world (soil: 8105 and 38939; sediment: 3294 and 7219; suspended particulate matter (SPM): 584 and 475 mu g/kg of glyphosate and AMPA). Lower detection frequency was observed in surface water (27-55%) with maximum concentrations in whole water of 1.80 and 1.90 mu g/L of glyphosate and AMPA, indicating that SPM analysis would be more sensitive for detection in the aquatic ecosystem. No detectable concentrations of glyphosate or AMPA were observed in groundwater. Glyphosate soil concentrations were better correlated with the total cumulative dose and total number of applications than the last spraying event dose, and an increment of 1 mg glyphosate/kg soil every 5 spraying events was estimated. Findings allow to infer that, under current practices, application rates are higher than dissipation rates. Hence, glyphosate and AMPA should be considered pseudo-persistent pollutants and a revisions of management procedures, monitoring programs, and ecological risk for soil and sediments should be also recommended.

Neurotoxicity is one of the subfields greatly profiting from the C. elegans model within biomedical context, while the corresponding potential of the organism applied to environmental studies is relevant but has been largely underexplored. Within the biomedical scope, the implication of metals and organic chemicals with pesticide activity (hereinafter designated as pesticides) in the etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases has been extensively investigated using this nematode as a primary model organism. Additionally, as a well-known experimental model bearing high sensitivity to different contaminants and representing important functional levels in soil and aquatic ecosystems, C. elegans has high potential to be extensively integrated within Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) routines. In spite of the recognition of some regulatory agencies, this actual step has yet to be made. The purpose of this review is to discuss the major advantages supporting the inclusion of C. elegans in lower tiers of ERA. Special emphasis was given to its sensitivity to metals and pesticides, which is similar to that of other model organisms commonly used in ERA (e.g. Daphnia magna and Eisenia sp.), and to the large array of endpoints that can be tested with the species, both concerning the aquatic and the soil compartments. The inclusion of C. elegans testing may hence represent a relevant advance in ERA, providing ecologically relevant insights toward improvement of the regulatory capacity for establishing appropriate environmental protection benchmarks.",2019,49,411,429,10.1080/10408444.2019.1626801
"Räsch, A; Hunsche, M; Mail, M; Burkhardt, J; Noga, G; Pariyar, S",Agricultural adjuvants may impair leaf transpiration and photosynthetic activity,PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,"Adjuvants such as surfactants are commonly incorporated into agrochemical formulations to enhance the biological efficiency of foliar sprays by improving the wetting behavior of the spray and/or the penetration of the active ingredients into the leaf tissues. Penetration accelerating adjuvants are known to increase the cuticular permeability and may alter the cuticular barrier to water loss. However, none or very little emphasis has been given to the impacts of adjuvants on crop water balance or drought tolerance, a very important factor affecting crop performance under water scarcity. Two model crops with strongly varying leaf traits, kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea) and apple (Malus domestica) seedlings were grown in controlled environments. Three adjuvants with varying solubility in the cuticle, i.e. octanol-water partition coefficients (logKow) were selected: rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and the surfactants alkyl polyglycoside (APG) and polyoxyethylated tallow amine (POEA). The higher the logKow of the adjuvant, the stronger was the increase of minimum epidermal conductance (g(min), an essential parameter describing plant drought tolerance). However, such effects depended on the physio-chemical properties of the leaf surface. In comparison to kohlrabi, the adjuvant effects on g(min), of apple leaves were relatively weak. The increase of g(min) was associated with a decrease in contact angle and with an alteration of the wax microstructure. Furthermore, POEA affected photochemical efficiency of kohlrabi leaves. Some adjuvants could have a temporal influence on transpirational water loss and g(min). At repeated applications, they might alter the effective water use and possibly reduce drought tolerance of some horticultural crops.",2018,132,229,237,10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.042

"Relyea, RA",New effects of Roundup on amphibians: Predators reduce herbicide mortality; herbicides induce antipredator morphology,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"The use of pesticides is important for growing crops and protecting human health by reducing the prevalence of targeted pest species. However, less attention is given to the potential unintended effects on nontarget species, including taxonomic groups that are of current conservation concern. One issue raised in recent years is the potential for pesticides to become more lethal in the presence of predatory cues, a phenomenon observed thus far only in the laboratory. A second issue is whether pesticides can induce unintended trait changes in nontarget species, particularly trait changes that might mimic adaptive responses to natural environmental stressors. Using outdoor mesocosms, I created simple wetland communities containing leaf litter, algae, zooplankton, and three species of tadpoles (wood frogs [Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus], leopard frogs [R. pipiens or L. pipiens], and American toads [Bufo americanus or Anaxyrus americanus]). I exposed the communities to a factorial combination of environmentally relevant herbicide concentrations (0, 1, 2, or 3 mg acid equivalents [a.e.]/L of Roundup Original MAX) crossed with three predator-cue treatments (no predators, adult newts [Notophthalmus viridescens], or larval dragonflies [A flax junius]). Without predator cues, mortality rates from Roundup were consistent with past studies. Combined with cues from the most risky predator (i.e., dragonflies), Roundup became less lethal (in direct contrast to past laboratory studies). This reduction in mortality was likely caused by the herbicide stratifying in the water column and predator cues scaring the tadpoles down to the benthos where herbicide concentrations were lower. Even more striking was the discovery that Roundup induced morphological changes in the tadpoles. In wood frog and leopard frog tadpoles, Roundup induced relatively deeper tails in the same direction and of the same magnitude as the adaptive changes induced by dragonfly cues. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show that a pesticide can induce morphological changes in a vertebrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the herbicide might be activating the tadpoles' developmental pathways used for antipredator responses. Collectively, these discoveries suggest that the world's most widely applied herbicide may have much further-reaching effects on nontarget species than previous considered.",2012,22,634,647,10.1890/11-0189.1
"Richmond, ME","Glyphosate: A review of its global use, environmental impact, and potential health effects on humans and other species",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES,"Glyphosate, [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine], was synthesized in 1950 and patented as a chemical chelator, capable of binding metals such as calcium, magnesium, and manganese. Glyphosate's ability to bind to manganese was later found to inhibit an enzyme used by plants and bacteria for biosynthesis of three amino acids found in all proteins, and the commercial value of this property led to the development and marketing of glyphosate as a broad-spectrum herbicide. In 1974, the Monsanto Chemical Company introduced the herbicide as Roundup (TM), a formulation of glyphosate and adjuvants. Roundup (TM) was originally used for weed control in specific farming and landscaping operations and around power lines and train tracks. Following introduction of Roundup Ready (TM) seeds, in the 1990s, glyphosate use increased significantly. Although Monsanto's patent on glyphosate expired in 2002, the widespread and growing use of Roundup Ready (TM) seed globally and competitive glyphosate marketing by other chemical companies have led to glyphosate's significant increase in the environment. Concerns about potential adverse effects have also grown. While, at present, many regulatory agencies have determined that there is little risk of adverse health effects to the general public or to farmworkers using proper handling techniques, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assessing hazard data on glyphosate identified it in 2016 as a category 2A carcinogen (likely to cause human cancer). Response to this classification has been divided: The agribusiness industry has been forceful in its opposition, while other experts support IARC's classification. The following article examines these issues. It also examines the basis for regulatory decisions, controversies involved, and questions of environmental justice that may or may not be addressed as glyphosate continues to be used.",2018,8,416,434,10.1007/s13412-018-0517-2

Roundup Original (R) (RO) contains an isopropylamine glyphosate (GLY) salt containing the surfactant POEA, while Roundup Transorb R (R) (RTR) contains a potassium salt of GLY with unknown surfactants. Both contain different compositions of so-called inert ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O-2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate ((V)over dot O-2 - mLO(2) Kg1 h(-1)) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) (V)over dot O-2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O-2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced (V)over dot O-2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O-2 diffusion distance to O-2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased (V)over dot O-2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of inert compounds and surfactants. (V)over dot O-2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in (V)over dot O-2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although less known than their larger relatives, the earthworms, these saprophagous organisms play similar roles in agricultural soils (but at a smaller scale), e.g., influencing soil structure and organic matter dynamics via microbial communities, and having a central place in soil food webs. Their diversity is rarely studied or often underestimated due to difficulties in distinguishing the species. New genetic techniques reveal that even in anthropogenically highly influenced soils, more than 10 species per site can be found. Because of their close contact with the soil pore water, a high ingestion rate and a thin cuticle, they often react very sensitively to a broad range of pesticides. Firstly we provide a short overview of the diversity and abundance of enchytraeid communities in agroecosystems. Afterwards, we explore the available data on enchytraeid sensitivity toward pesticides at different levels of biological organization, focusing on pesticides used in (mainly) European agroecosystems. Starting with non-standardized studies on the effects of pesticides on the sub-individual level, we compile the results of standard laboratory tests performed following OECD and ISO guidelines as well as those of higher-tier studies (i.e., semi-field and field tests). The number of comparable test data is still limited, because tests with enchytraeids are not a regulatory requirement in the European Union. While focusing on the effects of pesticides, attention is also given to their interactions with environmental stressors (e.g., climate change). In conclusion, we recommend to increase the use of enchytraeids in pesticide risk assessment because of their diversity and functional importance as well as their increasingly simplified use in (mostly standardized) tests at all levels of biological organization.",2017,5,,,10.3389/fenvs.2017.00020

We experimentally exposed in Japanese quail females and males (Cotumix japonica) to GBHs and respective controls from the age of 10 days -52 weeks. GBH exposure decreased hepatic activity of an intracellular antioxidant enzyme (catalase), independent of sex, but did not influence other intracellular oxidative stress biomarkers or neurotransmitter enzyme (acetylcholinesterase). GBH exposure altered overall gut microbiome composition, especially at a younger age and in females, and suppressed potentially beneficial microbes at an early age. Many of the microbial groups increased in frequency from 12 to 28 weeks under GBH exposure. GBH exposure decreased male testosterone levels both at sexual maturity and at 52 weeks of exposure, but did not clearly influence reproduction in either sex (maturation, testis size or egg production). Future studies are needed to characterize the effects on reproductive physiology in more detail.

We experimentally exposed a parental generation of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to GBHs (200mg/kg feed) or respective controls. Glyphosate residues were found in eggs (ca 0.76kg/mg). Embryonic development tended to be poorer in the eggs of GBH-exposed parents (76% of eggs showed normal development) compared to control parents (89% normal eggs). Embryonic brain tissue from GBH-exposed parents tended to express more lipid damage (20% higher), yet other biomarkers showed no apparent differences.

An increasing number of studies have identified GBH residues in soil, water, and even human food that may expose nontarget organisms including wildlife, livestock, and humans to health risks. After a heated debate, the European Union allowed the use of GBHs to continue until 2022, after which their risks will be re-evaluated. Thus, decision makers urgently need scientific evidence on GBH residues and their possible effects on ecosystems. An important, yet neglected, aspect is to assess whether animals show preference or avoidance for GBH-contaminated food, as it can influence the likelihood of adverse health effects in wildlife. Here, using Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) as our model, we show that females preferred GBH contaminated food compared to control food. In females, exposure to GBHs caused delayed plumage development, and GBH residues were present in eggs, muscles, and liver. These results indicate that female preference is not adaptive, potentially exposing nontarget animals to greater risk of adverse effects of GBHs in natural and agricultural environments. Our results on tissue residues suggest that further studies are needed to understand the risks of such residues in the food chain.",2020,54,1128,1135,10.1021/acs.est.9b07331

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.",2019,232,8,27,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.020

We examine first the routes of exposure of bees to agrochemicals used for crop protection and their application to crops, fate and contamination of water and plants around the fields. Most of the time, the exposure of bees to pesticides is through ingestion of residues found in the pollen and nectar of plants and in water. Honey bees are also exposed to pesticides used for the treatment of Varroa and other parasites. The basic concepts about the toxicity of the different kinds of pesticides are explained next. Various degrees of toxicity are found among agrochemicals, and emphasis is given to the classic tenet of toxicology, the dose makes the poison, and its modem version the dose and the time of exposure makes the poison. These two factors, dose and time, help us understand the severity of the impacts that pesticides may have on bees and their risk, which are analysed in the third section. Sublethal effects are also considered. The final section is devoted to some practical advice for avoiding adverse impacts of pesticides in beekeeping.",2016,,77,97,10.5772/62487

With the objective of detecting chronic, sublethal effects of the widely used herbicide glyphosate, an experiment was performed using the earthworm Eisenia fetida as model organism. Earthworm adults were randomly assigned to three glyphosate treatments: control (no glyphosate), regular dose for perennial weeds, and double dose. Six E. fetida individuals were placed in each pot. Two random pots were taken weekly from each treatment and the number of adults, individual weight, number of cocoons, and presence and number of young earthworms were recorded.

For that purpose, three commercial formulations containing the insecticides chlorpyrifos and endosulfan and the herbicide glyphosate were applied to a Mediterranean agricultural field. The soil was collected after spraying and dilution series were prepared with untreated soil to determine the impact of the pesticides on the avoidance behaviour and reproduction of the earthworm Eisenia andrei and the collembolan Folsomia candida. A significant avoidance was observed at the recommended field dose in case of endosulfan by earthworms (60 %) and in case of chlorpyrifos by collembolans (64 %). In addition, both insecticides affected the number of juveniles produced by the earthworms (EC50 were below the recommended field dose). Glyphosate did not seem to affect either earthworms or collembolans in the recommended field dose. Folsomia candida was more sensitive to pesticide application than Eisenia andrei, what was corroborated by the EC50 and LC50 values. In conclusion, insecticides may affect the structure of the soil community by reducing the survival of collembolans and the reproductive capacity of collembolans and earthworms.",2012,21,2113,2122,10.1007/s10646-012-0963-7

High volumes of agrochemicals applied to great variety of crops, together with agricultural expansion, generate great concerns due to the impact for the environment and large risk implicated for wildlife. The lack of data on these threats is striking. The tegu lizard (Salvator merianae) is one of the species that live in environments under contaminant effects. Several characteristics allow proposing this species as a potential sentinel organism for the monitoring of pesticides in their habitat. The present study is the first report about genotoxicity in tegu lizard neonates after embryonic exposure to Roundup (glyphosate 662%). The micronucleus test (MN), nuclear abnormalities (NAs) assay and comet assay (CA) were used as biomarkers of genotoxic effects induced in erythrocytes by topical exposure of the eggs to the glyphosate commercial formulation Roundup (R) (RU), in laboratory controlled conditions. A total of 96 eggs were distributed in six groups exposed to RU (50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 mu g/egg), one positive control (PC; 200 mu g cyclophosphamide/egg) and one negative control (NC; distilled water). No teratogenic effects were observed in any of the exposed or control neonates. A significant increase in DNA damage was observed in all concentrations higher than 100 mu g/egg with respect to NC (p < 0.05). However, no statistical differences were found in the frequencies of MN and NAs in any group exposed to RU compared to the NC No statistically significant differences were found in the size of the lizards at birth or after six months post-exposure (p>0.05).

The monarch's multi-generational migration between overwintering grounds in central Mexico and the summer breeding grounds in the northern U.S. and southern Canada is celebrated in all three countries and creates shared management responsibilities across North America. Here we present a novel Bayesian multivariate auto-regressive state-space model to assess quasi-extinction risk and aid in the establishment of a target population size for monarch conservation planning. We find that, given a range of plausible quasi-extinction thresholds, the population has a substantial probability of quasi-extinction, from 11-57% over 20 years, although uncertainty in these estimates is large. Exceptionally high population stochasticity, declining numbers, and a small current population size act in concert to drive this risk. An approximately 5-fold increase of the monarch population size (relative to the winter of 2014-15) is necessary to halve the current risk of quasi-extinction across all thresholds considered. Conserving the monarch migration thus requires active management to reverse population declines, and the establishment of an ambitious target population size goal to buffer against future environmentally driven variability.",2016,6,,,10.1038/srep23265
"Seralini, GE; Jungers, G",Endocrine disruptors also function as nervous disruptors and can be renamed endocrine and nervous disruptors (ENDs),TOXICOLOGY REPORTS,"Endocrine disruption (ED) and endocrine disruptors (EDs) emerged as scientific concepts in 1995, after numerous chemical pollutants were found to be responsible for reproductive dysfunction. The World Health Organization established in the United Nations Environment Programme a list of materials, plasticizers, pesticides, and various pollutants synthesized from petrochemistry that impact not only reproduction, but also hormonal functions, directly or indirectly. Cells communicate via either chemical or electrical signals transmitted within the endocrine or nervous systems. To investigate whether hormone disruptors may also interfere directly or indirectly with the development or functioning of the nervous system through either a neuroendocrine or a more general mechanism, we examined the scientific literature to ascertain the effects of EDs on the nervous system, specifically in the categories of neurotoxicity, cognition, and behaviour. To date, we demonstrated that all of the 177 EDs identified internationally by WHO are known to have an impact on the nervous system. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms underlying this neurodisruption have also been established. It was previously believed that EDs primarily function via the thyroid. However, this study presents substantial evidence that approximately 80 % of EDs operate via other mechanisms. It thus outlines a novel concept: EDs are also neurodisruptors (NDs) and can be collectively termed endocrine and nervous disruptors (ENDs). Most of ENDs are derived from petroleum residues, and their various mechanisms of action are similar to those of spam in electronic communications technologies. Therefore, ENDs can be considered as an instance of spam in a biological context.",2021,8,1538,1557,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.07.014

Although the concentrations of glyphosate and its main metabolite AMPA (aminomethylphosphonic acid) increased in blood plasma and seminal fluid during exposure, no significant differences in testis weight and sperm concentrations were observed between RU and CT roosters. However, sperm motility was significantly reduced, associated with decreased calcium and ATP concentrations in RU spermatozoa. Plasma testosterone and oestradiol concentrations increased in RU roosters. These negative effects ceased 14 days after RU removal from the diet. Epigenetic analysis showed a global DNA hypomethylation in RU roosters. After artificial insemination of hens (n = 40) with sperm from CT or RU roosters, eggs were collected and artificially incubated. Embryo viability did not differ, but chicks from RU roosters (n = 118) had a higher food consumption, body weight and subcutaneous adipose tissue content.

Informed application of control methods is required to reach restoration goals. The herbicide glyphosate, commonly applied in invasive plant management, can be toxic to native macrophytes. Our study assessed the response of 2 macrophytes that are endangered in our study area (Ammannia robusta and Sida hermaphrodita) to glyphosate concentrations that mimic incidental exposure from nearby invasive plant control: spray drift of 4 x 10(-7)% to 5% glyphosate; pulse and continuous immersion in water containing 2 to 41 mu g/L glyphosate; and rhizosphere contact with 5%-glyphosate-wicked invasive plants. We assessed macrophyte sensitivity at 14-d postexposure, and quantified abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Glyphosate spray concentrations as low as 0.1% reduced macrophyte growth. Ammannia was more sensitive overall to glyphosate spray than Sida, although sensitivity varied among measured endpoints. Conversely, macrophytes were not affected by immersion in low concentrations of glyphosate or rhizosphere contact with a glyphosate-wicked plant. Likewise, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi abundance in roots was similar among glyphosate-sprayed and control plants. Based on our results, we recommend that invasive plant managers reduce risks to native nontarget plants through implementing measures that limit off-target spray drift, and consider the feasibility of more targeted applications, such as with wick equipment.

The occurrence of glyphosate residues in European water bodies is rather well documented whereas only few, fragmented and outdated information is available for European soils. We provide the first large-scale assessment of distribution (occurrence and concentrations) of glyphosate and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in EU agricultural topsoils, and estimate their potential spreading by wind and water erosion. Glyphosate and/or AMPA were present in 45% of the topsoils collected, originating from eleven countries and six crop systems, with a maximum concentration of 2 mg kg(-1). Several glyphosate and AMPA hotspots were identified across the EU. Soil loss rates (obtained from recently derived European maps) were used to estimate the potential export of glyphosate and AMPA by wind and water erosion. The estimated exports, result of a conceptually simple model, clearly indicate that particulate transport can contribute to human and environmental exposure to herbicide residues. Residue threshold values in soils are urgently needed to define potential risks for soil health and off site effects related to export by wind and water erosion. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The EC50 effects on reproduction over 4 weeks was 4.63 mg glyphosate/kg of soil. The formulation included a polyethoxylated tallowamine as an adjuvant, which at 50% effect on reproduction had an estimated concentration of 0.87-1.49 mg/kg of soil.

RNA sequencing and shotgun proteomics were applied to assess differential transcript and protein expressions between exposed and control organisms in time, respectively. Specific functional categories at protein and transcriptome levels were concordant with each other, despite overall limited correlations between datasets.

Given melanin's broad roles in the biosphere, particularly in insect immune defenses, it is important to understand how exposure to ubiquitous environmental contaminants affects melanization. Glyphosate-the most widely used herbicide globally-inhibits melanin production, which could have wide-ranging implications in the health of many organisms, including insects. Here, we demonstrate that glyphosate has deleterious effects on insect health in 2 evolutionary distant species, Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), suggesting a broad effect in insects. Glyphosate reduced survival of G. mellonella caterpillars following infection with the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans and decreased the size of melanized nodules formed in hemolymph, which normally help eliminate infection. Glyphosate also increased the burden of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae mosquitoes, altered uninfected mosquito survival, and perturbed the microbial composition of adult mosquito midguts. Our results show that glyphosate's mechanism of melanin inhibition involves antioxidant synergy and disruption of the reaction oxidation-reduction balance. Overall, these findings suggest that glyphosate's environmental accumulation could render insects more susceptible to microbial pathogens due to melanin inhibition, immune impairment, and perturbations in microbiota composition, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations.",2021,19,,,10.1371/journal.pbio.3001182

Although reports about the impact of GLY in snails, crustaceans and amphibians exist, few studies have investigated its sublethal effects in non-target organisms such as the honeybee Apis mellifera, the main pollen vector in commercial crops. Here, we tested whether exposure to three sublethal concentrations of GLY (2.5, 5 and 10 mg l(-1): corresponding to 0.125, 0.250 and 0.500 mu g per animal) affects the homeward flight path of honeybees in an open field. We performed an experiment in which forager honeybees were trained to an artificial feeder, and then captured, fed with sugar solution containing traces of GLY and released from a novel site either once or twice. Their homeward trajectories were tracked using harmonic radar technology. We found that honeybees that had been fed with solution containing 10 mg l(-1) GLY spent more time performing homeward flights than control bees or bees treated with lower concentrations. They also performed more indirect homing flights. Moreover, the proportion of direct homeward flights performed after a second release from the same site increased in control bees but not in treated bees. These results suggest that, in honeybees, exposure to levels of GLY commonly found in agricultural settings impairs the cognitive capacities needed to retrieve and integrate spatial information for a successful return to the hive. Therefore, honeybee navigation is affected by ingesting traces of the most widely used herbicide worldwide, with potential long-term negative consequences for colony foraging success.",2015,218,2799,2805,10.1242/jeb.117291

"Stahlschmidt, ZR; Whitlock, J; Vo, C; Evalen, P; Bui, D",Pesticides in a warmer world: Effects of glyphosate and warming across insect life stages,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Glyphosate (GLY) is a broad-spectrum herbicide that is the most commonly applied pesticide in terrestrial ecosystems in the U.S. and, potentially, worldwide. However, the combined effects of warming associated with climate change and exposure to GLY and GLY-based formulations (GBFs) on terrestrial animals are poorly understood. Animals progress through several life stages (e.g., embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages) that may exhibit different sensitivities to stressors. Therefore, we factorially manipulated temperature and GLY/GBF exposure in the variable field cricket (Gryllus lineaticeps) during two life stages-nymphal development and adulthood-and examined key animal traits, such as developmental rate, body size, food consumption, reproductive investment, and lifespan. A thermal environment simulating future climate warming obligated several costs to fitness-related traits. For example, warming experienced during nymphal development reduced survival, adult body mass and size, and investment into flight capacity and reproduction. Warming experienced by adults reduced lifespan and growth rate. Alternatively, the effects of GBF exposure were more subtle, often context dependent (e.g., effects were only detected in one sex or temperature regime), and were stronger during adult exposure relative to exposure during development. There was evidence of additive costs of warming and GBF exposure to rates of feeding and growth in adults. Yet, the negative effect of GBF exposure to adult lifespan did not occur in warming conditions, suggesting that ongoing climate change may obscure some of the costs of GBFs to non-target organisms. The effects of GLY alone (i.e., in the absence of proprietary surfactants found in commercial formulations) were non-existent. Animals will be increasingly exposed to warming and GBFs, and our results indicate that GBF exposure and warming can entail additive costs for an animal taxon (insects) that plays critical roles in terrestrial ecosystems.",2022,307,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119508
"Straw, EA; Brown, MJF","No evidence of effects or interaction between the widely used herbicide, glyphosate, and a common parasite in bumble bees",PEERJ,"Background. Glyphosate is the world's most used pesticide and it is used without the mitigation measures that could reduce the exposure of pollinators to it. However, studies are starting to suggest negative impacts of this pesticide on bees, an essential group of pollinators. Accordingly, whether glyphosate, alone or alongside other stressors, is detrimental to bee health is a vital question. Bees are suffering declines across the globe, and pesticides, including glyphosate, have been suggested as being factors in these declines. Methods. Here we test, across a range of experimental paradigms, whether glyphosate impacts a wild bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris. In addition, we build upon existing work with honey bees testing glyphosate-parasite interactions by conducting fully crossed experiments with glyphosate and a common bumble bee trypanosome gut parasite, Crithidia bombi. We utilised regulatory acute toxicity testing protocols, modified to allow for exposure to multiple stressors. These protocols are expanded upon to test for effects on long term survival (20 days). Microcolony testing, using unmated workers, was employed to measure the impacts of either stressor on a proxy of reproductive success. This microcolony testing was conducted with both acute and chronic exposure to cover a range of exposure scenarios. Results. We found no effects of acute or chronic exposure to glyphosate, over a range of timespans post-exposure, on mortality or a range of sublethal metrics. We also found no interaction between glyphosate and Crithidia bombi in any metric, although there was conflicting evidence of increased parasite intensity after an acute exposure to glyphosate. In contrast to published literature, we found no direct impacts of this parasite on bee health. Our testing focussed on mortality and worker reproduction, so impacts of either or both of these stressors on other sublethal metrics could still exist. Conclusions. Our results expand the current knowledge on glyphosate by testing a previously untested species, Bombus terrestris, using acute exposure, and by incorpo-rating a parasite never before tested alongside glyphosate. In conclusion our results find that glyphosate, as an active ingredient, is unlikely to be harmful to bumble bees either alone, or alongside Crithidia bombi.",2021,9,,,10.7717/peerj.12486
"Straw, EA; Carpentier, EN; Brown, MJF",Roundup causes high levels of mortality following contact exposure in bumble bees,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pollinators underpin global food production, but they are suffering significant declines across the world. Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered 'bee safe' by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup(R)) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup(R) products, the consumer products Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use and Roundup(R) No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup(R) ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol(R). Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use(R) and 30% mortality with Roundup(R) ProActive(R), over 24 hr. Weedol(R) did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup(R) No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup(R) products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup(R) products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup(R) products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems.",2021,58,1167,1176,10.1111/1365-2664.13867
"Székács, A; Darvas, B",Re-registration Challenges of Glyphosate in the European Union,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"One of the most controversial societal issues today, regarding pesticide registration in the European Union (EU) may be the case surrounding re-registration of the active herbicide ingredient glyphosate. Shortly before the announcement of the conflicting views regarding the carcinogenicity status of this regulated agrochemical by EU Agencies, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the one hand, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on the other hand, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) also published re-evaluations. The US EPA assessment classified glyphosate into Group E, not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Similar positions were reached by EFSA and ECHA, assessing glyphosate as unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and not classified as a carcinogen, respectively. A strongly opposing evaluation has previously been reached by IARC by classifying glyphosate into Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. IARC identified potential cancer hazards in this case, but did not estimate the level of risk it may present, which was taken into consideration by opposing agencies. Multiple effects of glyphosate have been reported, of which carcinogenic effects are only one component. Formulated glyphosate products-especially with polyethoxylated tallowamine and related compounds-have been shown to cause stronger cytotoxic or endocrine disrupting effects than the active ingredient glyphosate alone. Questions related to hazards and corresponding risks identified in relation to this active ingredient and its formulated herbicide preparations divide scientific circles and official health and environmental authorities and organizations, and touch upon fundamental aspects of risk assessment and product regulation. The decision has to consider both hazard-based (IARC) and risk-based analysis (EFSA); the former may not be suitable to calculate practical significances, and the latter being challenged if exposure estimations are uncertain in light of new data on residue levels. The results of current analytical surveys on surface water are particularly worrisome. In turn, the precautionary principle appears to be the optimal approach in this case for regulation in the EU.",2018,6,,,10.3389/fenvs.2018.00078

"Tesfamariam, T; Bott, S; Cakmak, I; Römheld, V; Neumann, G",Glyphosate in the rhizosphere-Role of waiting times and different glyphosate binding forms in soils for phytotoxicity to non-target plants,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,"Glyphosate is the most widely used non-selective, systemic herbicide. It is easily translocated from shoot to roots and released into the rhizosphere, where it is immobilized at the soil matrix or microbially degraded. However, contradictory results are reported in the literature concerning the bio-availability of glyphosate residues in soils and the potential risks for intoxication of non-target organisms. This study addresses the question whether plant residues of glyphosate-treated weeds (model plant perennial rye grass. Lolium perenne L.) or direct soil application of glyphosate bears an intoxication risk for subsequently cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings. The experiments were conducted as greenhouse studies on two soils with contrasting properties (acidic, sandy Arenosol, calcareous loess subsoil). Also the potential role of different waiting times between glyphosate application and sunflower cultivation was considered. On both soils, sunflower seedling growth and biomass production was strongly impaired by glyphosate pre-sowing treatments in the variants with 0d waiting time and recovered within a waiting time of 7-21 d. Generally, the detrimental effects were more pronounced after glyphosate weed application (90% biomass reduction) compared with direct soil application (55-70% biomass reduction) at waiting time 0 d. The inhibitory effects on seedling growth were associated with a corresponding increase in shikimate accumulation in the root tissue as physiological indicator for glyphosate toxicity. Glyphosate intoxication of sunflower seedlings was also associated with an impairment of the manganese-nutritional status, which was still detectable after a waiting time of up to 21 cl, particularly on the Arenosol in the variants with glyphosate weed application. These findings indicate an important and yet uninvestigated role of glyphosate in plant residues in determining the risk of non-target plant intoxication. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The approach comprised 2 stages. In the first stage, honeybee colonies were exposed to a commercial formulation of glyphosate applied to flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia with glyphosate residues quantified in relevant matrices (pollen and nectar) collected by foraging bees on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 postapplication and glyphosate levels in larvae were measured on days 4 and 7. Glyphosate levels in pollen were approximately 10 times higher than in nectar and glyphosate demonstrated rapid decline in both matrices. Residue data along with foraging rates and food requirements of the colony were then used to set dose rates in the effects study. In the second stage, the toxicity of technical glyphosate to developing honeybee larvae and pupae, and residues in larvae, were then determined by feeding treated sucrose directly to honeybee colonies at dose rates that reflect worst-case exposure scenarios. There were no significant effects from glyphosate observed in brood survival, development, and mean pupal weight. Additionally, there were no biologically significant levels of adult mortality observed in any glyphosate treatment group. Significant effects were observed only in the fenoxycarb toxic reference group and included increased brood mortality and a decline in the numbers of bees and brood. Mean glyphosate residues in larvae were comparable at 4 days after spray application in the exposure study and also following dosing at a level calculated from the mean measured levels in pollen and nectar, showing the applicability and robustness of the approach for dose setting with honeybee brood studies. This study has developed a versatile and predictive approach for use in higher tier honeybee toxicity studies. It can be used to realistically quantify exposure of colonies to pesticides to allow the appropriate dose rates to be determined, based on realistic worst-case residues in pollen and nectar and estimated intake by the colony, as shown by the residue analysis. Previous studies have used the standard methodology developed primarily to identify pesticides with insect-growth disrupting properties of pesticide formulations, which are less reliant on identifying realistic exposure scenarios. However, this adaptation of the method can be used to determine dose-response effects of colony level exposure to pesticides with a wide range of properties. This approach would limit the number of replicated tunnel or field-scale studies that need to be undertaken to assess effects on honeybee brood and may be of particular benefit where residues in pollen and nectar are crop-and/or formulation-specific, such as systemic seed treatments and granular applications.

"Thompson, LJ; Smith, S; Stout, JC; White, B; Zioga, E; Stanleya, DA",Bumblebees can be Exposed to the Herbicide Glyphosate when Foraging,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Herbicides are the most widely used pesticides globally. Although used to control weeds, they may also pose a risk to bee health. A key knowledge gap is how bees could be exposed to herbicides in the environment, including whether they may forage on treated plants before they die. We used a choice test to determine if bumblebees would forage on plants treated with glyphosate at two time periods after treatment. We also determined whether glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid were present as residues in the pollen collected by the bees while foraging. Finally, we explored if floral resources (nectar and pollen) remained present in plants after herbicide treatment. In general bees indiscriminately foraged on both plants treated with glyphosate and controls, showing no avoidance of treated plants. Although the time spent on individual flowers was slightly lower on glyphosate treated plants, this did not affect the bees' choice overall. We found that floral resources remained present in plants for at least 5 days after lethal treatment with glyphosate and that glyphosate residues were present in pollen for at least 70 h posttreatment. Our results suggest that bees could be exposed to herbicide in the environment, both topically and orally, by foraging on plants in the period between herbicide treatment and death. Identifying this route of exposure is a first step in understanding the risks of herbicides to bees. The effects of herbicides on bees themselves are uncertain and warrant further investigation to allow full risk assessment of these compounds to pollinating insects.

Several studies have investigated the effects of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) on male reproduction, but there is still little and conflicting evidence for its toxicity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of glyphosate, alone or in formula, on the male reproductive system. Pregnant mice were treated from E10.5 to 20 days postpartum by adding glyphosate or a GBH (Roundup 3 Plus) to their drinking water at 0.5 (the acceptable daily intake, ADI dose), 5 and 50 mg/kg/day. Male offspring derived from treated mice were sacrificed at 5, 20, and 35 days old (d.o.) and 8 months old (m.o.) for analysis. Our result showed that exposure to glyphosate, but not GBH, affects testis morphology in 20 d.o. and decrease serum testosterone concentrations in 35 d.o. males. We identified that the spermatozoa number decreased by 89% and 84% in 0.5 and 5 mg/kg/day of GBH and glyphosate groups, respectively. Moreover, the undifferentiated spermatogonia numbers were decreased by 60% in 5 mg/kg/day glyphosate group, which could be due to the alterations in the expression of genes involved in germ cell differentiation such as Sall4 and Nano3 and apoptosis as Bax and Bcl2. In 8 m.o. animals, a decreased testosterone level was observed in GBH groups. Our data demonstrate that glyphosate and GBHs could cause endocrine-disrupting effects on male reproduction at low doses. As glyphosate has effects at the ADI level, our data suggest that the current ADI for glyphosate could be overestimated.",2019,169,260,271,10.1093/toxsci/kfz039

In general, chemical control of weeds is considered to be an easy, relatively cheap, and highly effective method. However, not all weeds can be successfully controlled, either because of their natural tolerance or their herbicide resistance. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. It can manage effectively a broad spectrum of weeds, and promotes conservation agriculture by significantly reducing conventional plough tillage. Unfortunately, its extensive use has led to the evolution of glyphosate resistance, which has evolved into a major problem for global crop production. Alternative herbicides are, in some cases, available, but they do not usually control certain weeds as efficiently as glyphosate. The transmission of herbicides to the target site is a complex process, and consists of several stages. Each herbicide is affected and can be manipulated by the product formulation for the optimization of its use. Many experiments have confirmed that different glyphosate salts and adjuvant additives are instrumental in the optimization of herbicide absorption and delivery processes. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief overview of these experiments and summarize the literature related to the effect of various glyphosate formulations and adjuvants on weed control. Determining the differences among formulations and adjuvants may lead to the further optimized long-term use of glyphosate.",2017,7,,,10.3390/agronomy7030060

We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms-Annelida: Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-AMF, Glomerales). We hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites, AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 % (P < 0.001). Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community structure.",2014,50,13,23,10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1

The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox((R)) bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup((R)) toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l). In contrast, microalgae and crustaceans were 4-5 folds more sensitive to Roundup((R)) toxicity than bacteria and protozoa. Except photosynthetic microalgae, POEA accounted for more than 86% of Roundup((R)) toxicity and the toxicity contribution of POEA was shown to be species-dependent. Increase in pH (6-9) and increase of suspended sediment concentration (0-200 mg/l) significantly increased the toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia, but there were no significant effects due to temperature change and food addition.

Glyphosate application on plants results in a slow death, accelerated by reduced resistance to root pathogens. Extensive glyphosate use has resulted in increasing residues in soil and waterways. Although direct glyphosate effects on animals are limited, major concerns have arisen about indirect harmful side effects. In this paper, we focus on indirect effects of sublethal concentrations of glyphosate on plant, animal and human health due to shifts in microbial community compositions in successive habitats. Research results of glyphosate effects on microbial communities in soil, rhizosphere and animal guts have been contradictory due to the different integration levels studied. Most glyphosate studies have tested short-term treatment effects on microbial biomass or general community composition at higher taxonomic levels in soil, rhizosphere or animal intestinal tracts, and found little effect. More detailed studies showed reductions in specific genera or species as well as biological processes after glyphosate application. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and beneficial intestinal bacteria often are negatively affected, while pathogenic bacteria and fungi are enhanced. Such shifts in microbial community composition have been implicated in enhanced susceptibility of plants to Fusarium and Rhizoctonia, of birds and mammals to toxic Clostridium and Salmonella species, and of bees to Serratia and Deformed Wing Virus. In animals and humans, glyphosate exposure and concentrations in urine have been associated with intestinal diseases and neurological as well as endocrine problems, but cause-effect relationships need to be determined in more detail.

However, in recent years, concerns have increased worldwide about the potential wide ranging direct and indirect health effects of the large scale use of glyphosate. In 2015, the World Health Organization reclassified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans. A detailed overview is given of the scientific literature on the movement and residues of glyphosate and its breakdown product aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) in soil and water, their toxicity to macro-and microorganisms, their effects on microbial compositions and potential indirect effects on plant, animal and human health. Although the acute toxic effects of glyphosate and AMPA on mammals are low, there are animal data raising the possibility of health effects associated with chronic, ultra-low doses related to accumulation of these compounds in the environment. Intensive glyphosate use has led to the selection of glyphosate-resistant weeds and microorganisms. Shifts in microbial compositions due to selective pressure by glyphosate may have contributed to the proliferation of plant and animal pathogens. Research on a link between glyphosate and antibiotic resistance is still scarce but we hypothesize that the selection pressure for glyphosate-resistance in bacteria could lead to shifts in microbiome composition and increases in antibiotic resistance to clinically important antimicrobial agents. We recommend interdisciplinary research on the associations between low level chronic glyphosate exposure, distortions in microbial communities, expansion of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of animal, human and plant diseases.

A survey was conducted in 2017-2018 to describe the contemporary global status of pesticide lifecycle management, to identify where the gaps are found. A three-tiered questionnaire was distributed to government entities in 194 countries. The response rate was 29%, 27% and 48% to the first, second and third part of the questionnaire, respectively. The results showed gaps for most of the selected indicators of pesticide management, suggesting that pesticide efficacy and safety to human health and the environment are likely being compromised at various stages of the pesticide lifecycle, and at varying degrees across the globe. Low-income countries generally had the highest incidence of gaps. Particular shortcomings were deficiencies in pesticide legislation, inadequate capacity for pesticide registration, protection against occupational exposure to pesticides, consumer protection against residues in food, and environmental protection against pesticide contamination. Policy support for, and implementation of, pesticide use-reduction strategies such as integrated pest management and integrated vector management has been inadequate across regions. Priority actions for structural improvement in pesticide lifecycle management are proposed, including pesticide use-reduction strategies, targeted interventions, and resource mobilization.

During the growing season, those crop fields often receive additional broadband herbicide applications. However, despite this broad utilization, very little is known on potential side effects or interactions between these different pesticide classes on soil organisms. In a greenhouse pot experiment, we studied single and interactive effects of seed dressing of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Capo) with neonicotinoid insecticides and/or strobilurin and triazolinthione fungicides and an additional one-time application of a glyphosate-based herbicide on the activity of earthworms, soil microorganisms, litter decomposition, and crop growth. To further address food-web interactions, earthworms were introduced to half of the experimental units as an additional experimental factor. Seed dressings significantly reduced the surface activity of earthworms with no difference whether insecticides or fungicides were used. Moreover, seed dressing effects on earthworm activity were intensified by herbicides (significant herbicide x seed dressing interaction). Neither seed dressings nor herbicide application affected litter decomposition, soil basal respiration, microbial biomass, or specific respiration. Seed dressing did also not affect wheat growth. We conclude that interactive effects on soil biota and processes of different pesticide classes should receive more attention in ecotoxicological research.",2017,8,,,10.3389/fpls.2017.00215
"Vázquez, DE; Balbuena, MS; Chaves, F; Gora, J; Menzel, R; Farina, WM",Sleep in honey bees is affected by the herbicide glyphosate,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Sleep plays an essential role in both neural and energetic homeostasis of animals. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) manifest the sleep state as a reduction in muscle tone and antennal movements, which is susceptible to physical or chemical disturbances. This social insect is one of the most important pollinators in agricultural ecosystems, being exposed to a great variety of agrochemicals, which might affect its sleep behaviour. The intake of glyphosate (GLY), the herbicide most widely used worldwide, impairs learning, gustatory responsiveness and navigation in honey bees. In general, these cognitive abilities are linked with the amount and quality of sleep. Furthermore, it has been reported that animals exposed to sleep disturbances show impairments in both metabolism and memory consolidation. Consequently, we assessed the sleep pattern of bees fed with a sugar solution containing GLY (0, 25, 50 and 100 ng) by quantifying their antennal activity during the scotophase. We found that the ingestion of 50 ng of GLY decreased both antennal activity and sleep bout frequency. This sleep deepening after GLY intake could be explained as a consequence of the regenerative function of sleep and the metabolic stress induced by the herbicide.",2020,10,,,10.1038/s41598-020-67477-6

Actually, GLY has been detected in honey and bee pollen baskets. However, its impact on the honey bee brood is poorly explored. Therefore, we assessed the effects of GLY on larval development under chronic exposure during in vitro rearing. Even though this procedure does not account for social compensatory mechanisms such as brood care by adult workers, it allows us to control the herbicide dose, homogenize nutrition and minimize environmental stress. Our results show that brood fed with food containing GLY traces (1.25-5.0 mg per litre of food) had a higher proportion of larvae with delayed moulting and reduced weight. Our assessment also indicates a non-monotonic dose-response and variability in the effects among colonies. Differences in genetic diversity could explain the variation in susceptibility to GLY. Accordingly, the transcription of immune/detoxifying genes in the guts of larvae exposed to GLY was variably regulated among the colonies studied. Consequently, under laboratory conditions, the response of honey bees to GLY indicates that it is a stressor that affects larval development depending on individual and colony susceptibility.",2018,13,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0205074

Habitat loss and alteration associated with crop production play an important role in reptile decline, among which lizards are particularly endangered. In this study, we evaluated testicular structure, steroidogenesis, and estrogen receptor expression/localization after three weeks of oral exposure to glyphosate at 0.05 and 0.5 mu g/kg body weight every other day in the field lizard Podarcis siculus. Our results show that glyphosate affected testicular morphology, reduced spermatogenesis, altered gap junctions and changed the localization of estrogen receptors in germ cells, increasing their expression; the effects were mostly dose-dependent. The result also demonstrates that glyphosate, at least at these concentrations, did not influence steroidogenesis. Overall, the data indicate that this herbicide can disturb the morphophysiology of the male lizard's reproductive system, with obviously detrimental effects on their reproductive fitness. The effects of glyphosate must be considered biologically relevant and could endanger the reproductive capacity not only of lizards but also of other vertebrates, including humans; a more controlled and less intensive use of glyphosate in areas devoted to crop production would therefore be advisable.",2022,23,,,10.3390/ijms23094850

As vertebrate insectivores, lizards protect plants from herbivorous insects increasing plant biomass via the trophic cascade and represent an important link between invertebrates and higher predators. A negative effect of glyphosate on lizards' survival could have major impacts at the ecological levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of the exposure to low doses of glyphosate on the liver of the wall lizard Podarcis siculus, a suitable bioindicator of soil pollution. Two different doses of pure glyphosate (0.05 and 0.5 g/kg body weight) were orally administered every other day for 3 weeks to sexually mature males and females. The results demonstrated that both doses, despite being very low, are toxic for the liver that showed clear signs of suffering, regardless of sex. The histological analysis provided a scenario of severe hepatic condition, which degenerated until the appearance of fibrotic formations. The morphological observations were consistent with a loss of liver physiological functions. Immunocytochemical investigations allowed us to detect an involvement of antioxidant/cytoprotective proteins, such as superoxide dismutase 1 (Cu/Zn SOD, known as SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), metallothionein (MT), and tumor suppressor protein 53, (p53) suggesting that the liver was trying to react against stress signals and damage induced by glyphosate. Finally, in situ hybridization and Real-Time PCR analysis showed the upregulation of estrogen receptor and vitellogenin gene expression, thus demonstrating the xenoestrogenic action of glyphosate. The imbalance of the hormonal homeostasis could threaten the lizards' reproductive fitness and survival, altering the trophic cascade.",2019,2019,,,10.1155/2019/4746283
"Vereecken, H",Mobility and leaching of glyphosate: a review,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"There is currently concern that glyphosate, a strongly sorbing non-selective herbicide which is widely used in Europe, may be leached from the root zone into drainage water and groundwater. The purpose of this review is to present and discuss the state of knowledge with respect to the mobility and leaching of glyphosate from agricultural soils. Specific attention is given to the adsorption behaviour of glyphosate and the analysis of available studies on glyphosate transport. In addition, there are a number of experimental and numerical studies indicating that other strongly sorbing substances may be transported rapidly to the sub-surface. The experimental studies analysed in the paper encompass column-, lysimeter- and field-scale experiments on glyphosate transport. The experimental findings, combined with transport studies on other strongly sorbing pesticides in the literature, support the hypothesis that transport of glyphosate may be caused by an interaction of high rainfall events shortly after application on wet soils showing the presence of preferential flow paths. Concentrations of glyphosate in European groundwater have been reported occasionally but monitoring is still limited. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005,61,1139,1151,10.1002/ps.1122

The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration.

The use of this agrochemical has unintended consequences on non-target organisms, such as honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), the Earth's most prominent insect pollinator. However, detailed understanding of the biological effects in bees in response to sub-lethal glyphosate exposure is still limited. In this study, H-1 NMR-based metabolomics was performed to investigate whether oral exposure to an environmentally realistic concentration (7.12 mg L-1) of glyphosate affects the regulation of honey bee metabolites in 2, 5, and 10 days. On Day 2 of glyphosate exposure, the honey bees showed significant downregulation of several essential amino acids, including leucine, lysine, valine, and isoleucine. This phenomenon indicates that glyphosate causes an obvious metabolic perturbation when the honey bees are subjected to the initial caging process. The mid-term (Day 5) results showed negligible metabolite-level perturbation, which indicated the low glyphosate impact on active honeybees. However, the long-term (Day 10) data showed evident separation between the control and experimental groups in the principal component analysis (PCA). This separation is the result of the combinatorial changes of essential amino acids such as threonine, histidine, and methionine, while the non-essential amino acids glutamine and proline as well as the carbohydrate sucrose were all downregulated. In summary, our study demonstrates that although no significant behavioral differences were observed in honey bees under sub-lethal doses of glyphosate, metabolomic level perturbation can be observed under short-term exposure when met with other environmental stressors or long-term exposure.",2022,18,635,642,10.1039/d2mo00046f

According to acute dermal toxicity assays, an increase of ambient temperature from 15 degrees C to 35 degrees C decreased the acute dermal toxicity of beta-cyfluthrin (BC) but increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos (CPF). The toxicity of avermectin (AVM) did not show significant temperature-dependent responses. Based on thermal preference trials, lizards changed their body temperature via TR behavior to adaptively reduce toxicity under sub-lethal doses, which can be understood as a self-rescue behavior attenuating lethal effects. However, the risk quotient indicated that the effectiveness of this self-rescue behavior is limited. Metabolomics analysis showed that six different metabolites (i.e., creatine, glutamate, succinate, N-acetylaspartate, acetylcholine, and lactate) contributed to TR behavior changes. Biochemical assays and insecticide residue results demonstrated that the temperature-dependent toxicity of BC, CPF, and AVM affected lizards in the three aspects of biotransformation, oxidative stress, and neurometabolic interference. This work clarifies the ecotoxicological impacts of represen-tative insecticides on reptiles from toxicological understanding to risk relevance.

Chemical control can be a cost-effective way to control or eradicate invasive species. Chemical control is currently in use in New Zealand to limit impacts of non-native mammals and plants on a range of native biodiversity. However, it is important to consider the potential non-target risks of chemical control to native species that are likely already significantly reduced in number. We aimed to characterise the toxicity of several rodenticides and herbicides to reptiles and to provide a screening-level risk assessment of these chemicals applicable to native reptiles of New Zealand using the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, as a surrogate organism. We used the Up-and-Down testing procedure to estimate oral toxicity for all compounds. We tested five rodenticides (brodifacoum, coumatetralyl, pindone, diphacinone and cholecalciferol). Only pindone was toxic to fence lizards at concentrations below 1750 mu g g(-1) (LD50 = 550 mu g g(-1)). We tested five herbicides (glyphosate, clopyralid, triclopyr, metsulfuron-methyl and haloxyfop-methyl) and one common adjuvant in glyphosate formulations (polyethoxylated tallowamine or POEA). Only triclopyr was toxic to fence lizards below 1750 mu g g(-1) (LD50 = 550 mu g g(-1)). Toxicity does not necessarily imply risk. Using the pindone concentrations in accepted bait formulations in New Zealand, a 10 g lizard would need to ingest 4.7 g of pindone bait in a single day in order to achieve toxic levels, which is extremely unlikely. We used the highest acceptable application rate for triclopyr to estimate risk for reptiles and found minimal risk of acute toxicity from triclopyr applications. Taken together, our data suggest little risk of reptile acute toxicity from the tested rodenticides or herbicides in New Zealand, but research into sub-lethal effects is also required in order to make informed decisions about the ecological impacts of chemically controlling invasive species.",2016,40,342,350,

This study extends the current interest by presenting three experiments highlighting some of the limitations to current phytotoxicity testing guidelines. Several crops and wild plant species were grown under greenhouse conditions following standard protocol for phytotoxicity testing. Plants were sprayed with five different herbicides at the four- to six-leaf stage, and biomass was recorded at 28 d after spray. Results showed that current regulatory protocol will likely underestimate herbicide phytotoxicity if testing does not include data for the complete tank-mix formulation. The present study also showed that the range in herbicide sensitivity among cultivars of the same crop can be quite extensive and that, depending on the cultivar included in a risk assessment, conclusions regarding the phytotoxicity of any given herbicide may differ. Although no significant differences in sensitivity were found between crops and related wild species, results revealed that current guidelines are too rigid in terms of species selection. Considering the variability among crop cultivars, coupled with the ecological importance and the ease of germination of many noncrop plant species, pesticide regulatory guidelines would be improved if wild species were included in testing. Findings of the present study indicate that current pesticide regulatory guidelines require modifications to ensure a more accurate assessment of herbicide effects on nontarget plant species.",2007,26,2634,2643,10.1897/06-553.1

Crop yields have increased, but a long-held hypothesis is that domestication has also unintentionally decreased plant defences against herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis comparing insect herbivore resistance and putative plant defence traits between crops and their wild relatives. Our database included 2098 comparisons made across 73 crops in 89 studies. We found that domestication consistently reduced plant resistance to herbivores, although the magnitude of the effects varied across plant organs and depended on how resistance was measured. However, domestication had no consistent effects on the specific plant defence traits underlying resistance, including secondary metabolites and physical feeding barriers. The values of these traits sometimes increased and sometimes decreased during domestication. Consistent negative effects of domestication were observed only when defence traits were measured in reproductive organs or in the plant organ that was harvested. These results highlight the complexity of evolution under domestication and the need for an improved theoretical understanding of the mechanisms through which agronomic selection can influence the species interactions that impact both the yield and sustainability of our food systems.

The transport rate of glyphosate (including AMPA) from the litter layer into earthworm burrows ranged from 6.6 +/- 4.6% to 183 +/- 2.4%, depending on synergetic effects of microplastics and glyphosate application.

Results showed that glyphosate decay was gradual and followed a single first-order decay kinetics model. In different treatments (with/without microplastic addition), glyphosate showed similar half-lives (32.8 days). The soil content of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), the main metabolite of glyphosate, steadily increased without reaching plateau and declining phases throughout the experiment. Soil microbial respiration significantly changed throughout the entirety of the experiment, particularly in the treatments with higher microplastic addition. The dynamics of soil beta-glucosidase, urease and phosphatase varied, especially in the treatments with high microplastic addition. Particles that were considerably smaller than the initially added microplastic particles were observed after 30 days incubation.

The key structural and functional parameters were estimated by culturable aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) density, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, and functional richness. Functional richness was evaluated as the proportion of carbon sources utilized in microplates containing various carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and aromatic compounds, and 1,3,5-triphenyiltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as redox dye. Three different soil types (Typic Argiudoll, Typic Haplustoll and Petrocalcic Paleustoll) were collected from agricultural fields with reported history of herbicide application. Soil microcosms were treated with one herbicide at a time at a dose 10 times higher than the recommended field application rates (glyphosate, 150 mg ad. kg(-1); 2,4-D, 5 mg a.i. kg(-1); metsulfuron-methyl, 1 mg a.i. kg(-1) soil) and incubated for up to 3 weeks. Metsulfuron-methyl had the least pronounced effects on soil microbial community. 2,4-D showed transient effects on soils, inhibiting either SIR or FDA and stimulating DHA. Several short-term effects of glyphosate on microbial activities and bacterial density were observed: (1) early stimulation of SIR and AHB; (2) dissimilar response in the soils for FDA and DHA; (3) transient increase in functional richness. To conclude, the addition of these herbicides at a dose 10 times higher than the normal field application rates caused minor changes to soil microbial activity, bacterial density and functional richness.

Samples were analyzed for 566 substances by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry. We analyzed relationships between frequency and concentrations of pesticides, land use, meteorological parameters, substance properties, and season. We found totally 67 pesticide active ingredients (24 herbicides, 30 fungicides, 13 insecticides) with 10-53 pesticides per site. Herbicides metolachlor, pendimethalin, prosulfocarb, terbuthylazine, and the fungicide HCB were found in all PUF samplers, and glyphosate in all PEF samplers; chlorpyrifos-ethyl was the most abundant insecticide found in 93% of the samplers. Highest concentrations showed the herbicide prosulfocarb (725 +/- 1218 ng sample-1), the fungicide folpet (412 +/- 465 ng sample(-1)), and the insecticide chlorpyrifos-ethyl (110 +/- 98 ng sample(-1)). Pesticide numbers and concentrations increased with increasing proportions of arable land in the surroundings. However, pesticides were also found in two National Parks (10 and 33 pesticides) or a city center (17 pesticides). Pesticide numbers and concentrations changed between seasons and correlated with land use, temperature, radiation, and wind, but were unaffected by substance volatility. Potential ecotoxicological exposure of mammals, birds, earthworms, fish, and honeybees increased with increasing pesticide numbers and concentrations. Human toxicity potential of detected pesticides was high, with averaged 54% being acutely toxic, 39% reproduction toxic, 24% cancerogenic, and 10% endocrine disrupting. This widespread pesticide air pollution indicates that current environmental risk assessments, field application techniques, protective measures, and regulations are inadequate to protect the environment and humans from potentially harmful exposure.",2022,838,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156012

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.",2021,33,,,10.1186/s12302-021-00492-0

However, not much is known on potential side effects on soil organisms or on the nutrition of grapevines (Vitis vinifera). In an experimental vineyard in Austria, we examined the impacts of three within-row herbicide treatments (active ingredients: flazasulfuron, glufosinate, glyphosate) and mechanical weeding on grapevine root mycorrhization; soil microorganisms; earthworms; and nutrient concentration in grapevine roots, leaves, xylem sap and grape juice. The three herbicides reduced grapevine root mycorrhization on average by 53% compared to mechanical weeding. Soil microorganisms (total colony-forming units, CFU) were significantly affected by herbicides with highest CFUs under glufosinate and lowest under glyphosate. Earthworms (surface casting activity, density, biomass, reproduction) or litter decomposition in soil were unaffected by herbicides. Herbicides altered nutrient composition in grapevine roots, leaves, grape juice and xylem sap that was collected 11 months after herbicide application. Xylem sap under herbicide treatments also contained on average 70% more bacteria than under mechanical weeding; however, due to high variability, this was not statistically significant. We conclude that interdisciplinary approaches should receive more attention when assessing ecological effects of herbicides in vineyard ecosystems.",2018,25,23215,23226,10.1007/s11356-018-2422-3
"Zaller, JG; Heigl, F; Ruess, L; Grabmaier, A",Glyphosate herbicide affects belowground interactions between earthworms and symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi in a model ecosystem,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Herbicides containing glyphosate are widely used in agriculture and private gardens, however, surprisingly little is known on potential side effects on non-target soil organisms. In a greenhouse experiment with white clover we investigated, to what extent a globally-used glyphosate herbicide affects interactions between essential soil organisms such as earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We found that herbicides significantly decreased root mycorrhization, soil AMF spore biomass, vesicles and propagules. Herbicide application and earthworms increased soil hyphal biomass and tended to reduce soil water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall. Herbicide application in interaction with AMF led to slightly heavier but less active earthworms. Leaching of glyphosate after a simulated rainfall was substantial and altered by earthworms and AMF. These sizeable changes provide impetus for more general attention to side-effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on key soil organisms and their associated ecosystem services.",2014,4,,,10.1038/srep05634

Moreover, these two processes are interlinked as ecosystem invasibility is considered to increase with decreasing biodiversity. In temperate grasslands, earthworms serve as important ecosystem engineers making up the majority of soil faunal biomass. Herbivore behaviour has been shown to be affected by earthworms, however it is unclear whether these effects differ with the composition of plant communities. To test this we conducted a mesocosm experiment where we added earthworms (Annelida: Lumbricidae) to planted grassland communities with different plant species composition (3 vs. 12 plant spp.). Plant communities had equal plant densities and ratios of the functional groups grasses, non-leguminous forbs and legumes. Later, Arion vulgaris slugs (formerly known as A. lusitanicus; Gastropoda: Arionidae) were added and allowed to freely choose among the available plant species. This slug species is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe. We hypothesized that (i) the food choice of slugs would be altered by earthworms' specific effects on the growth and nutrient content of plant species, (ii) slug herbivory will be less affected by earthworms in plant communities containing more plant species than in those with fewer plant species because of a more readily utilization of plant resources making the impacts of earthworms less pronounced. Results: Slug herbivory was significantly affected by both earthworms and plant species composition. Slugs damaged 60% less leaves when earthworms were present, regardless of the species composition of the plant communities. Percent leaf area consumed by slugs was 40% lower in communities containing 12 plant species; in communities containing only three species earthworms increased slug leaf area consumption. Grasses were generally avoided by slugs. Leaf length and number of tillers was increased in mesocosms containing more plant species but little influenced by earthworms. Overall shoot biomass was decreased, root biomass increased in plant communities with more plant species. Earthworms decreased total shoot biomass in mesocosms with more plant species but did not affect biomass production of individual functional groups. Plant nitrogen concentrations across three focus species were 18% higher when earthworms were present; composition of plant communities did not affect plant quality. Conclusions: Given the important role that both herbivores and earthworms play in structuring plant communities the implications of belowground-aboveground linkages should more broadly be considered when investigating global change effects on ecosystems.",2013,13,,,10.1186/1472-6785-13-20
"Zhao, J; Neher, DA; Fu, SL; Li, ZA; Wang, KL",Non-target effects of herbicides on soil nematode assemblages,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Background Herbicides are used extensively to control weeds. However, little is known about the non-target effects of herbicides on soil nematode assemblages. The objective of this study was to determine whether herbicides affect the abundance of nematodes in specific trophic groups. Meta-analysis was performed, and the calculated effect size, lr, quantified the impact of herbicides on the abundance of total nematodes and five trophic groups (bacterivores, fungivores, plant parasites, omnivores and predators). Results Measurements of lr indicated that herbicides decreased abundance of both fungivores and predators; however, abundance of bacterivores, plant parasites and omnivores increased. Overall, total nematode abundance tended to increase in response to herbicide application. Conclusion The decrease in predator abundance suggests that herbicide application disturbs soil food webs. The increase in bacterivore and decrease in fungivore abundance suggest that bacterivores are more tolerant and both fungivores and predators more sensitive to herbicide applications. Herbicides also have non-target effects on omnivores, which may be due to the increased amount of food resources for omnivores after weed control. Additionally, the use of herbicides may result in a risk of an increase in plant-parasitic nematode abundance. (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry",2013,69,679,684,10.1002/ps.3505
"Zhou, CF; Wang, YJ; Li, CC; Sun, RJ; Yu, YC; Zhou, DM",Subacute toxicity of copper and glyphosate and their interaction to earthworm (Eisenia fetida),ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Glyphosate (GPS) and copper (Cu) are common pollutants in soils, and commonly co-exist. Due to the chemical structure of GPS, it can form complexes of heavy metals and interface their bioavailability in soil environment. In order to explore the interactions between GPS and Cu, subacute toxicity tests of Cu and GPS on soil invertebrate earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were conducted. The relative weight loss and whole-worm metal burdens increased significantly with the increasing exposure concentration of Cu, while the toxicity of GPS was insignificant. The joint toxicity data showed that the relative weight loss and the uptake of Cu, as well as the superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde activities, were significantly alleviated in the present of GPS, which indicated that GPS could reduce the toxicity and bioavailability of Cu in the soil because of its strong chelating effects.

It affects metal behaviors in soil-water system as its functional groups such as amine, carboxylate and phosphonate can react with metal ions to form metal complexes. The reaction will result in the decreasing of heavy metal bioavailability. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the interactions between GPS and copper (Cu) on the acute toxicity of soil invertebrate earthworm (Eisenia fetida), which was exposed to aqueous solutions for 48 h with different mixing concentrations of Cu and GPS (technical-grade Gly acid). The mortality rates, Cu uptake by earthworm, and some biomarkers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione (GSH) content, and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity were measured. The mortality rates and whole-worm metal burdens increased significantly with the increasing Cu concentration in solution. However, toxicity of GPS to earthworms was not observed in this study. Furthermore, the presence of GPS could significantly reduce the acute toxicity of Cu to earthworms. The mortality rates decreased sharply and the uptake of Cu was nearly halted in the presence of GPS. In addition, the SOD activity, GSH content, and AchE activity almost declined to the levels of the control. These results demonstrate that GPS could control the toxicity as well as the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil solutions where both GPS and heavy metals often coexist.",2012,21,2297,2305,10.1007/s10646-012-0986-0
"Zioga, E; White, B; Stout, JC",Glyphosate used as desiccant contaminates plant pollen and nectar of non-target plant species,HELIYON,"Pesticide products containing glyphosate as a systemic active ingredient are some of the most extensively used herbicides worldwide. After spraying, residues have been found in nectar and pollen collected by bees foraging on treated plants. This dietary exposure to glyphosate could pose a hazard for flower-visiting animals including bees, and for the delivery of pollination services. Here, we evaluated whether glyphosate contaminates nectar and pollen of targeted crops and non-target wild plants. Oilseed rape was selected as focal crop species, and Rubus fruticosus growing in the hedgerows surrounding the crop was chosen as non-target plant species. Seven fields of oilseed rape, where a glyphosate-based product was applied, were chosen in east and southeast Ireland, and pollen and nectar were extracted from flowers sampled from the field at various intervals following glyphosate application. Pollen loads were taken from honeybees and bumblebees foraging on the crop at the same time. Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) residues were extracted using acidified methanol and their concentrations in the samples were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Glyphosate was detected in R. fruticosus nectar and pollen samples that were taken within a timeframe of two to seven days after the application on the crop as a desiccant. No glyphosate was detected when the application took place before or more than two months prior to our sampling in any of the evaluated matrices. The metabolite AMPA was not detected in any samples. To gain further insight into the potential extent of translocation within both plants and soil when a crop is desiccated using glyphosate before harvesting, and the potential impacts on bees, we recommend a longitudinal study of the presence and fate of glyphosate in non -target flowering plants growing nearby crop fields, over a period of several days after glyphosate application.",2022,8,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12179
"Zobiole, LHS; Kremer, RJ; Oliveira, RS; Constantin, J",Glyphosate affects micro-organisms in rhizospheres of glyphosate-resistant soybeans,JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,"Aims: Glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean production increases each year because of the efficacy of glyphosate for weed management. A new or 'second' generation of GR soybean (GR2) is now commercially available for farmers that is being promoted as higher yielding relative to the previous, 'first generation' (GR1) cultivars. Recent reports show that glyphosate affects the biology and ecology of rhizosphere micro-organisms in GR soybean that affect yield. The objective of this research was to evaluate the microbiological interactions in the rhizospheres of GR2 and GR1 soybean and the performance of the cultivars with different rates of glyphosate applied at different growth stages. Methods and Results: A greenhouse study was conducted using GR1 and GR2 soybean cultivars grown in a silt loam soil. Glyphosate was applied at V2, V4 and V6 growth stages at three rates. Plants harvested at R1 growth stage had high root colonization by Fusarium spp.; reduced rhizosphere fluorescent pseudomonads, Mn-reducing bacteria, and indoleacetic acid-producing rhizobacteria; and reduced shoot and root biomass. Conclusions: Glyphosate applied to GR soybean, regardless of cultivar, negatively impacts the complex interactions of microbial groups, biochemical activity and root growth that can have subsequent detrimental effects on plant growth and productivity. Significance and Impact of the Study: The information presented here will be crucial in developing strategies to overcome the potential detrimental effects of glyphosate in GR cropping systems.",2011,110,118,127,10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04864.x
