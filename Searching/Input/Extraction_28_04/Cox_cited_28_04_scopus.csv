Simonsen D.; Cwiertny D.M.; Lehmler H.-J.,Benoxacor is enantioselectively metabolized by rat liver subcellular fractions,2020,Chemico-Biological Interactions,330,,,10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109247,"This study investigated the enantioselective metabolism of benoxacor, an ingredient of herbicide formulations, in microsomes or cytosol prepared from female or male rat livers. Benoxacor was incubated for ≤30 min with microsomes or cytosol, and its enantioselective depletion was measured using gas chromatographic methods. Benoxacor was depleted in incubations with active microsomes in the presence and absence of NADPH, suggesting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and microsomal carboxylesterases (CESs). Benoxacor was depleted in cytosolic incubations in the presence of glutathione, consistent with its metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The depletion of benoxacor was faster in incubations with cytosol from male than female rats, whereas no statistically significant sex differences were observed in microsomal incubations. The consumption of benoxacor was inhibited by the CYP inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole, the CES inhibitor benzil, and the GST inhibitor ethacrynic acid. Estimates of the intrinsic clearance of benoxacor suggest that CYPs are the primary metabolic enzyme responsible for benoxacor metabolism in rats. Microsomal incubations showed an enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer (E1-benoxacor). A greater enrichment occurred in incubations with microsomes from female (EF = 0.67 ± 0.01) than male rats (EF = 0.60 ± 0.01). Cytosolic incubations from female rats resulted in enrichment of E1-benoxacor (EF = 0.54 ± 0.01), while cytosolic incubations from male rats displayed enrichment of the second eluting enantiomer (E2-benoxacor; EF = 0.43 ± 0.01). Sex-dependent differences in the metabolism of benoxacor in rats could significantly impact ecological risks and mammalian toxicity. Moreover, changes in the enantiomeric enrichment of benoxacor may be a powerful tool for environmental fate and transport studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
Anton B.J.; Dehnert G.K.; Karasov W.H.,"Subchronic impacts of 2,4-D herbicide Weedestroy®AM40 on associative learning in juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens)",2021,Aquatic Toxicology,237,,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105909,"Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control a wide variety of invasive and nuisance plants. One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations in Midwestern states is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Due to the stability of 2,4-D in aquatic environments, many non-target aquatic species experience prolonged exposure throughout critical developmental life stages that can affect essential behaviors. However, the impacts of 2,4-D exposure on learning behaviors in juvenile fish are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments using a maze environment to determine the effects of a commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulation (Weedestroy®AM40; WAM40; at 0.00, 0.50, 2.00, and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D acid equivalent (a.e.)) exposure on juvenile yellow perch's ability to perform a feed associated learning behavior. We observed a significant decrease in the ability of yellow perch to correctly complete the feed associated learning behavior within 200 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to controls (p = 0.0002; p < 0.0001, respectively) and within 600 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.0 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to the controls (p = 0.0107 and p < 0.0001). These data suggest that exposure to 2,4-D in WAM40 can both increase the amount of time it takes for yellow perch to complete a feed associated learning behavior and/or obstruct the behavior altogether. Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p > 0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch. © 2021"

In the present study, we tested the effects of acetone (0.1% in feed), a solvent commonly used to dissolve pesticides, on bees exposed at different developmental stages (larval and/or adult). Moreover, we explored the potential effect of in vitro larval rearing, a commonly used technique for accurately monitoring worker exposure at the larval stage, by combining acetone exposure and treatment conditions (in vitro larval rearing vs. in vivo larval rearing). We then analyzed the life-history traits of the experimental bees using radio frequency identification technology over three sessions (May, June, and August) to assess the potential seasonal dependence of the solvent effects. Our results highlight the substantial influence of in vitro larval rearing on the life cycle of bees, with a 47.7% decrease in life span, a decrease of 0.9 days in the age at first exit, an increase of 57.3% in the loss rate at first exit, and a decrease of 40.6% in foraging tenure. We did not observe any effect of exposure to acetone at the larval stage on the capacities of bees reared in vitro. Conversely, acetone exposure at the adult stage reduced the bee life span by 21.8% to 60%, decreased the age at first exit by 1.12 to 4.34 days, and reduced the foraging tenure by 30% to 37.7%. Interestingly, we found a significant effect of season on acetone exposure, suggesting that interference with the life-history traits of honey bees is dependent on season. These findings suggest improved integration of long-term monitoring for assessing sublethal responses in bees following exposure to chemicals during both the larval and adult stages.

Fungicide triazoles and strobilurins based are the most widely used and require a specific effort to investigate toxicological effects on non-target species. This study evaluates the toxic effects of four commercial fungicides Prosaro® (tebuconazole and prothioconazole), Amistar®Xtra (azoxystrobin and cyproconazole), Mirador® (azoxystrobin) and Icarus® (Tebuconazole) on Eisenia fetida using several biomarkers: lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), total glutathione (GSHt), DNA fragmentation (comet assay) and lysozyme activity tested for the first time in E. fetida. The exposure to Mirador® and AmistarXtra® caused an imbalance of ROS species, leading to the inhibition of the immune system. AmistarXtra® and Prosaro®, composed of two active ingredients, induced significant DNA alteration, indicating genotoxic effects. This study broadened our knowledge of the effects of pesticide product formulations on earthworms and showed the need for improvement in the evaluation of toxicological risk deriving from the changing of physicochemical and toxicological properties that occur when a commercial formulation contains more than one active ingredient and several unknown co-formulants. © The Author(s) 2024."
Bruce A.B.; Borlu Y.; Glenna L.L.,Assessing the scientific support for U.S. EPA pesticide regulatory policy governing active and inert ingredients,2023,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,13,1,13,10.1007/s13412-022-00788-4,"US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide regulatory policy only requires environmental impact and safety testing and labeling of the active ingredients of pesticide products, rather than the end use formula. This policy is thought to partially explain the conflicting outcomes of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and EPA assessments on glyphosate, and there is substantial scientific evidence that this approach has led to an underestimation of risk. In this paper, we present a review of EPA pesticide policy governing the regulation of active and other ingredients and findings from a survey of US agricultural scientists focused on their views of this EPA policy. The survey findings indicate that the scientists we surveyed support a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of pesticide products, including both active and inert ingredients, as well as the end use product, to test for combined effects. They also support the disclosure and labeling of inert ingredients to support independent testing of these chemicals. The results also indicate that university scientists oriented towards public science are more likely to support regulation than university scientists oriented towards private science. Overall, despite substantial evidence that the combination of all ingredients in pesticide products may be more toxic than the active ingredients alone, the current regulatory approach does not provide a pathway for the agency to respond to this science. In this sense, the scientific support for the agency’s current regulatory approach is unclear. © 2022, AESS."
Ashu F.A.; Fouet C.; Ambadiang M.M.; Penlap-Beng V.; Kamdem C.,Vegetable oil-based surfactants are adjuvants that enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoid insecticides and can bias susceptibility testing in adult mosquitoes,2023,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,17,,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011737,"Background The standard operating procedure for testing the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes to neoni-cotinoid or butenolide insecticides recommends using a vegetable oil ester (Mero) as a sur-factant. However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay. Methodology/Principal findings Using standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifi-cally enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evalu-ate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. © 2023 Ashu et al."
Li C.; Zhou J.; Yue N.; Wang Y.; Wang J.; Jin F.,Dissipation and dietary risk assessment of tristyrylphenol ethoxylate homologues in cucumber after field application,2021,Food Chemistry,338,,,10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127988,"The potential for tristyrylphenol ethoxylates (TSPEOs) residues to contaminate crops or be released into the environment is of increasing concern, as they are toxic to living organisms. This study determined the dissipation of TSPEO homologues in cucumber under field conditions. TSPEOn (n = 6–29) dissipated more rapidly in cucumber than in soil samples, with half-lives of 1.80–4.30 d and 3.73–6.52 d, respectively. Short-chain TSPEOn (n = 6–11) persisted for longer than other oligomers in soil. Concentrations of the final residues (∑TSPEOs) in cucumber and soil were 24.3–1349 μg/kg and 47.3–1337 μg/kg, respectively. TSP15EO or TSP16EO was the dominant oligomer, with concentrations of 2.30–150 μg/kg. The risk assessment showed that the acute and chronic dietary exposure risks of ∑TSPEOs in cucumber were 0.03–0.57% and 0.05–0.39%, respectively, suggesting little or no health risk to Chinese consumers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
Abou Zeid M.I.; Jammoul A.M.; Melki K.C.; Jawdah Y.A.; Awad M.K.,Suggested policy and legislation reforms to reduce deleterious effect of pesticides in Lebanon,2020,Heliyon,6,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05524,"Countrywide pesticide management activities are resource draining, even for developed countries, which sometimes fall short in achieving the optimum protection against pesticides deleterious effects on humans and environment. Additionally, in Lebanon, basic flaws exist at different levels of pesticide management cycle. In this study, through an extensive review of relevant literature regarding the pesticides impact on humans and environment in Lebanon and adopted policies in existing legislation, several gaps have been identified. Accordingly, recommendations to reduce pesticide risk through a combination of reforms at the policy level and its tools, particularly legislation, are proposed. In our opinion, the starting point is to adopt a minimum list of lower risk pesticides supported by a combination of: “prescriptions” based on a comprehensive registration and an effective implementation systems, a suitable IPM/ICM government-supported credit system, traceability systems of agricultural commodities and pesticides containers, Pesticide stock management system to reduce the quantity of obsolete pesticides, and containers recycling system. For a global sustainability of pesticides risk reduction, a binding global intervention fostered by the UN, based on human rights for safe food, is called upon to ban hazardous pesticides-except those of WHO class IV- trafficking in developing countries scoring low in an international official assessment of their pesticides lifecycle management. At the same time, global funds should support pesticides alternatives and the enhancement of the developing countries capacities for pesticides lifecycle management, which is a part of a larger global matrix in risk reduction. © 2020 The Authors; Policy, legislations, reforms, pesticides, prescription, developing countries, risk reduction; Agricultural Policy; Crop Protection; Chemical Pest Control; Environmental Assessment; Legislation © 2020 The Authors"
Straw E.A.; Brown M.J.F.,Co-formulant in a commercial fungicide product causes lethal and sub-lethal effects in bumble bees,2021,Scientific Reports,11,,,10.1038/s41598-021-00919-x,"Pollinators, particularly wild bees, are suffering declines across the globe, and pesticides are thought to be drivers of these declines. Research into, and regulation of pesticides has focused on the active ingredients, and their impact on bee health. In contrast, the additional components in pesticide formulations have been overlooked as potential threats. By testing an acute oral dose of the fungicide product Amistar, and equivalent doses of each individual co-formulant, we were able to measure the toxicity of the formulation and identify the ingredient responsible. We found that a co-formulant, alcohol ethoxylates, caused a range of damage to bumble bee health. Exposure to alcohol ethoxylates caused 30% mortality and a range of sublethal effects. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees consumed half as much sucrose as negative control bees over the course of the experiment and lost weight. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees had significant melanisation of their midguts, evidence of gut damage. We suggest that this gut damage explains the reduction in appetite, weight loss and mortality, with bees dying from energy depletion. Our results demonstrate that sublethal impacts of pesticide formulations need to be considered during regulatory consideration, and that co-formulants can be more toxic than active ingredients. © 2021, The Author(s)."
Moreira A.; Nogueira V.; Bouguerra S.; Antunes S.C.; Rodrigues S.,Ecotoxicity of bioinsecticide spinosad to soil organisms: Commercial formulation versus active ingredient,2025,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part - C: Toxicology and Pharmacology,287,,,10.1016/j.cbpc.2024.110056,"Spintor® (SPIT®) is a commercial formulation of a bioinsecticide with the active ingredient Spinosad (SPIN). Despite the efforts of regulatory agencies, there still is a lack of information regarding short- and long-term exposures to soil-dwellers, as well as effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of SPIT® and SPIN, on the oligochaete Eisenia fetida, and the arthropod Folsomia candida. For this, natural soil was spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations (0.00–1.49 mg of the active ingredient·kg−1 of dry soil) to assess avoidance behaviour in E. fetida and reproduction effects on both species. Further, in E. fetida adults exposed for 2- and 28-day biomarkers of oxidative stress, energetic reserves, neurotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated. A significant reduction in juvenile production for F. candida was observed for SPIT® at ≥0.66 mg kg−1 and SPIN at ≥0.13 mg kg−1, and although no effect was observed on E. fetida reproduction, the oligochaeta revealed a tendency to avoid soil spiked with SPIT® at 0.44, 0.66 and 1.49 mg kg−1. The sub-individual responses of E. fetida demonstrate genotoxicity upon exposure to SPIT® and SPIN for 2 days. The 2-day exposures of SPIT® and SPIN seem to induce defence mechanisms, and in general, SPIN exerted higher effects than SPIT® on the oligochaetes. Overall, the pro-oxidant performance and energy metabolism pathways were disrupted in both exposures to SPIT® and SPIN. The results suggest that spinosyns-based products can have an impact on soil arthropods F. candida and oligochaete's health, possibly affecting their essential functions in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors"
Peluso J.; Martínez Chehda A.; Olivelli M.S.; Aronzon C.M.,Ecotoxicological effects of the emerging contaminant ivermectin on Rhinella arenarum: A comparative study of active ingredient and commercial formulation,2024,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part - C: Toxicology and Pharmacology,283,,,10.1016/j.cbpc.2024.109965,"Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad-spectrum veterinary antiparasitic used worldwide in cattle breeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lethal effects of the active ingredient and a commercial formulation of IVM (1 % active ingredient) in the embryonic stage (S. 4–6) and larval stage (S. 25) of the South American amphibian Rhinella arenarum through chronic standardized bioassays. Also, behavior analysis and oxidative stress and cholinergic effects biomarkers were analyzed at 1, 10 and 100 μg IVM/L concentrations. For the embryonic stage, the active ingredient (96 h- LC50: 15900 μg/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC50: 51230 μg/L) during the acute period, while at chronic exposure the commercial formulation was more toxic (504 h-LC50: 10.25 μg/L), compared to the active ingredient (504 h-LC50: 312.80 μg/L). For the larval stage, in acute exposure, the active ingredient (96 h-LC50: 800 μg/L) was more toxic than the commercial formulation (96 h-LC50: 1550 μg/L). In the chronic exposure, the commercial formulation (504 h-LC50: 77.33 μg/L) was more toxic than the active ingredient (504 h-LC50: 195.25 μg/L). Overall, larvae exhibited greater sensitivity to both the active ingredient and the commercial formulation. However, during chronic exposure, embryos were more sensitive to the commercial formulation than larvae. The commercial formulation primarily induced oxidative stress, and both forms of the compound affected behavior and cholinergic effect biomarkers, even at low environmentally relevant concentrations (1 μg/L). These results highlight the potential impact of IVM on aquatic ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Specifically, pesticide runoff can disrupt hormonal, reproductive, and developmental processes in aquatic organisms, yet non-point source pollution is difficult to trace and quantify. In Oregon, U.S.A., state and federal forestry pesticide regulations, designed to meet regulatory water quality requirements, differ in buffer size and pesticide applications. We deployed passive water samplers and collected riverine and estuarine bivalves Margaritifera falcata, Mya arenaria, and Cras-sostrea gigas from Oregon Coast watersheds to examine forestry-specific pesticide contamination. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling and regression to relate concentrations and types of pesticide contamination across watersheds to ownership and management metrics. In bivalve samples collected from eight coastal watersheds, we measured twelve unique pesticides (two herbicides; three fungicides; and seven insecticides). Pesticides were detected in 38% of bivalve samples; and frequency and maximum concentrations varied by season, species, and watershed with indaziflam (herbicide) the only current-use forestry pesticide detected. Using passive water samplers, we measured four current-use herbicides corresponding with planned herbicide applications; hexazinone and atrazine were most frequently detected. Details about types and levels of exposure provide insight into effectiveness of current forest management practices in controlling transport of forest-use pesticides. © 2021 by the authors.

Mach B.M.; Glynn S.E.; Daniels J.C.; Dale A.G.,Target and non-target effects of insecticide use during ornamental milkweed production,2024,Environmental Entomology,53,648,658,10.1093/ee/nvae056,"There are widespread public efforts to conserve wildlife in urbanized landscapes via the installation of nursery-grown plants that support Lepidoptera taxa. Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs. This study demonstrates a conflict between insect pest management and Lepidoptera conservation during ornamental plant production and has implications for the conservation value of ornamentals after retail sale.  © The Author(s) 2024.

Synthetic insecticides have mostly been used to combat this pest, raising human and environmental health concerns. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could compensate for or augment the harmful effects of agrochemicals. Herein, we aimed to assess whether PGPR-induced defenses in corn plants impact the host-plant selection behavior of S. litura. Headspace volatile organic compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Larvae fed inoculated corn exhibited lower weights and relative growth rate than noninoculated plants. Under choice experiments, PGPR-treated plants significantly reduced percentage leaf damage area and oviposition rate compared to untreated plants. Volatile organic compound ratio emission varied significantly between control and PGPR treatments, which, in part, explains feeding and oviposition deterrence in PGPR-treated plants. The results demonstrate that PGPR inoculation can enhance corn resistance to S. litura, making it a promising candidate for crop protection strategies.  © 2024 The Author(s)."
Fine J.D.; Cox-Foster D.L.; Moor K.J.; Chen R.; Avalos A.,Trisiloxane Surfactants Negatively Affect Reproductive Behaviors and Enhance Viral Replication in Honey Bees,2024,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,43,222,233,10.1002/etc.5771,"Trisiloxane surfactants are often applied in formulated adjuvant products to blooming crops, including almonds, exposing the managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) used for pollination of these crops and persisting in colony matrices, such as bee bread. Despite this, little is known regarding the effects of trisiloxane surfactants on important aspects of colony health, such as reproduction. In the present study, we use laboratory assays to examine how exposure to field-relevant concentrations of three trisiloxane surfactants found in commonly used adjuvant formulations affect queen oviposition rates, worker interactions with the queen, and worker susceptibility to endogenous viral pathogens. Trisiloxane surfactants were administered at 5 mg/kg in pollen supplement diet for 14 days. No effects on worker behavior or physiology could be detected, but our results demonstrate that hydroxy-capped trisiloxane surfactants can negatively affect queen oviposition and methyl-capped trisiloxane surfactants cause increased replication of Deformed Wing Virus in workers, suggesting that trisiloxane surfactant use while honey bees are foraging may negatively impact colony longevity and growth.

Magna E.K.; Koranteng S.S.; Donkor A.; Gordon C.,Levels of Persistent Organochlorine Compounds in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from Three Cage Aquaculture Farms on the Volta Basin of Ghana: Implications for Human Health,2022,Environmental Processes,9,,,10.1007/s40710-022-00600-z,"Increased agrochemical-based agricultural activities along the Volta basin and cage aquaculture practices from the cage farms have raised concerns about the potential ecological risk to the aquatic ecosystem. To assess this, caged tilapia samples were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP). Fish samples in acetone/hexane (2:1v/v) solvent medium were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath, shaken electronically, cleaned by solid-phase extraction, and analysed using GC/ECD for OCPs and GC/MS for PCBs. The levels of OCPs reported in the fish ranged; ND – 2.31 µg/kg (fish farm A), <LOD – 4.3 µg/kg (fish farm B), <LOD – 6.11 µg/kg (fish farm C) and ND – 0.88 µg/kg (control). The highest concentration of 6.11 µg/kg was encountered for δ-HCH in tilapia from fish farm C, while p,p’-DDE recorded the lowest in fish from Farm A. The levels of the OCPs detected in cage tilapia were below the maximum residue limits (MRL) proposed by the EU. Six PCBs congeners, i.e., PCB 18, PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 101, PCB153 and PCB 180 were detected and concentrations ranged from 0.288 to 0.931 µg/kg dw, 0.042–1.321 µg/kg dw, 0.260-10.657 µg/kg dw, and ND − 0.298 µg/kg dw in fish Farms A, B, C and control, respectively. Risk assessment of POPs indicated that ∑PCBs in Farm C fish may pose health risk to consumers. Further analysis revealed that Farms B and C fish polluted with endrin may pose cancer risk to children consumers. Frequent monitoring of PCBs, OCPs and other contaminants is needed to mitigate the impacts on human health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Simonsen D.; Heffelfinger J.; Cwiertny D.M.; Lehmler H.-J.,Benoxacor is enantioselectively metabolized by microsomes and cytosol from the human liver,2023,Emerging Contaminants,9,,,10.1016/j.emcon.2022.100198,"Benoxacor is a safener added to current-use herbicide formulations to protect the target crop from herbicidal toxicity. It is an emerging environmental contaminant that has been detected in surface waters, raising the possibility of human exposure via drinking water. Because it is not subject to the same regulations as active pesticide ingredients, its metabolism and toxicity in humans have not been studied. Here we investigate the enantioselective metabolism of benoxacor in human subcellular fractions. Pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and cytosol (pHLC) were incubated with racemic benoxacor for up to 30-min. Gas chromatographic analyses were used to measure the enantioselective depletion of benoxacor. pHLMs with and without nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH, co-factor for cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]) and pHLC with glutathione (GSH, co-factor for glutathione S-transferases [GSTs]) metabolized benoxacor. These results demonstrate that microsomal CYPs, microsomal carboxylesterase (CESs), and cytosolic GSTs metabolize benoxacor. Females were predicted to have a higher clearance of benoxacor by GSTs than males. Male and female pHLM incubations with NADPH showed enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer (E1-benoxacor). pHLM incubations without NADPH and pHLC incubations with GSH showed an enrichment of the second eluting enantiomer of benoxacor (E2-benoxacor). Our results indicate that human hepatic microsomal and cytosolic enzymes enantioselectively metabolize benoxacor, a fact that needs to be considered when investigating human exposures and toxicities of benoxacor. © 2022 The Authors"

Among the transgenic plants, those tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate are among the most common. Weed resistance to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) has been on the rise, leading to increased herbicide applications. This, in turn, has led to increased glyphosate residues in feed. Although glyphosate has been considered to be generally safe to animal health, recent studies have shown that GBHs have potential to cause adverse effects in animal reproduction, including disruption of key regulatory enzymes in androgen synthesis, alteration of serum levels of estrogen and testosterone, damage to reproductive tissues and impairment of gametogenesis. This review emphasizes known effects of GBHs on reproductive health as well as the potential risk GBH residues pose to animal agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s)"

To enhance the efficacy of the active ingredient, GBHs used in practice often contain other ingredients marked as inert “adjuvants” or “co-formulants”, the toxic properties of which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the cytotoxic effects of pure glyphosate, three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) and two co-formulants commonly used in GBHs as assessed via CCK-8 assay, and the extent of their potential oxidative damage as assessed via superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, in order to reveal the role of adjuvants in the toxicity of the formulations. Our results showed that glyphosate alone did not significantly affect cell viability. In contrast, GBHs and adjuvants induced a pronounced cytotoxic effect from a concentration of 100 μM. SOD activity of cells treated with GBHs or adjuvants was significantly lower compared to cells treated with glyphosate alone. This suggests that the adjuvants in GBHs are responsible for the cytotoxic effects of the formulations through the induction of oxidative stress. © 2023 by the authors."

PPPs do not only affect target organisms but also affect non-targets, such as the honey bee Apis mellifera and their microbiome. This study is the first of its kind, aiming to characterize the effect of PPPs on the microbiome of the cuticle of honey bees. We chose PPPs, which have frequently been detected in bee bread, and studied their effects on the cuticular microbial community and function of the bees. The effects of the fungicide Difcor® (difenoconazole), the insecticide Steward® (indoxacarb), the combination of both (mix A) and the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid and dimoxystrobin), the insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid), and the combination of both (mix B) were tested. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal transcribed spacer region gene-based amplicon sequencing and quantification of gene copy numbers were carried out after nucleic acid extraction from the cuticle of honey bees. The treatment with Steward® significantly affected fungal community composition and function. The fungal gene copy numbers were lower on the cuticle of bees treated with Difcor®, Steward®, and PPP mix A in comparison with the controls. However, bacterial and fungal gene copy numbers were increased in bees treated with Cantus® Gold, Mospilan®, or PPP mix B compared to the controls. The bacterial cuticular community composition of bees treated with Cantus® Gold, Mospilan®, and PPP mix B differed significantly from the control. In addition, Mospilan® on its own significantly changed the bacterial functional community composition. Cantus® Gold significantly affected fungal gene copy numbers, community, and functional composition. Our results demonstrate that PPPs show adverse effects on the cuticular microbiome of honey bees and suggest that PPP mixtures can cause stronger effects on the cuticular community than a PPP alone. The cuticular community composition was more diverse after the PPP mix treatments. This may have far-reaching consequences for the health of honey bees.

These compounds have been developed to disrupt pest species physiology, but because their specificity is limited, they can also have adverse effects on non-target organisms. Recent studies have shown that the damaging toxicological effects of pesticides can be amplified in stressful environments. However, few studies have documented these effects in natural settings where organisms are simultaneously exposed to pesticides and to other environmental stressors such as parasites. In this study, we assessed both pesticide and ectoparasite effects on the physiology of a free-ranging bird. We measured physiological markers including haematocrit, bacteria-killing ability (BKA) and leucocyte counts, as well as exposure to haematophagous Protocalliphora larvae, in tree swallow nestlings (Tachycineta bicolor), a declining aerial insectivore, in southern Québec, Canada, for over 3 years. We found that combined exposure to pesticides and Protocalliphora larvae was negatively related to haematocrit, suggesting possible synergistic effects. However, we found no such relationships with BKA and leucocyte counts, highlighting the complexity of physiological responses to multiple stressors in natural settings. Populations of several aerial insectivores are declining, and although sublethal pesticide effects on physiology are suspected, our results suggest that exposure to other factors, such as parasitism, should also be considered to fully assess these effects, especially because pesticides are increasingly present in the environment.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Besides traditional risk factors such as smoking, some environmental substances can augment the risk of COPD. The European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU) is a program evaluating citizens’ exposure to various environmental substances and their possible health impacts. Within the HBM4EU, eighteen priority substances or substance groups were chosen. In this scoping review, seven of these substances or substance groups are reported to have an association or a possible association with COPD. Main exposure routes, vulnerable and high‐exposure risk groups, and matrices where these substances are measured are described. Pesticides in general and especially organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, and some herbicides, lead (Pb), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed an association, and cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr and CrVI), arsenic (As), and diisocyanates, a possible association with COPD and/or decreased lung function. Due to long latency in COPD’s disease process, the role of chemical exposure as a risk factor for COPD is probably underestimated. More research is needed to support evidence‐based conclusions. Generally, chemical exposure is a growing issue of concern, and prompt action is needed to safeguard public health. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
Donley N.; Cox C.; Bennett K.; Temkin A.M.; Andrews D.Q.; Naidenko O.V.,Forever Pesticides: A Growing Source of PFAS Contamination in the Environment,2024,Environmental Health Perspectives,132,,,10.1289/EHP13954,"BACKGROUND: Environmental contamination by fluorinated chemicals, in particular chemicals from the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) class, has raised concerns around the globe because of documented adverse impacts on human health, wildlife, and ecosystem quality. Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS: We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION: We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and “inert” ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of “inert” ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Herein, a multi-stimuli-responsive nano/microcapsule bidirectional delivery system loaded with pyraclostrobin (Pyr) is prepared through interfacial cross-linking from a lignin-based Pickering emulsion template. During this process, methacrylated alkali lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are utilized as stabilizers for the tunable oil-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion. Subsequently, a thiol-ene radical reaction occurs with the acid-labile cross-linkers at the oil-water interface, leading to the formation of lignin nano/microcapsules (LNCs) with various topological shapes. Through the investigation of the polymerization process and the structure of LNC, it was found that the amphiphilicity-driven diffusion and distribution of cyclohexanone impact the topology of LNC. The obtained Pyr@LNC exhibits high encapsulation efficiency, tunable size, and excellent UV shielding to Pyr. Additionally, the flexible topology of the Pyr@LNC shell enhances the retention and adhesion of the foliar surface. Furthermore, Pyr@LNC exhibits pH/laccase-responsive targeting against Botrytis disease, enabling the intelligent release of Pyr. The in vivo fungicidal activity shows that efficacy of Pyr@LNC is 53% ± 2% at 14 days postspraying, whereas the effectiveness of Pyr suspension concentrate is only 29% ± 4%, and the acute toxicity of Pyr@LNC to zebrafish is reduced by more than 9-fold compared with that of Pyr technical. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that the LNCs can be bidirectionally translocated in plants. Therefore, the topology-regulated bidirectional delivery system LNC has great practical potential for sustainable agriculture. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),2024,BioNanoScience,14,3108,3123,10.1007/s12668-024-01341-z,"Spodoptera litura (Fab.) is a serious cosmopolitan pest with extensive host range causing severe economic losses to agricultural and horticultural crops. The essential oil (EO) of citronella grass, Cymbopogon winterianus Jowitt, known for its repellent activity against many insects, is considered as source of potential bio-pesticides. In the present study, citronella oil was extracted from the leaves by hydro-distillation method and analysed for chemical constituents using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The phytochemical profiling of the same revealed the presence of thirteen mono- and sesqui-terpenoids, the major compounds being citronellal (26.38%), trans geraniol (24.61%) and citronellol (13.80%). A stable and homogeneous oil in water (O/W) nano-emulsion of citronella essential oil with oil content (15%) and Tween 80 (5%) was formulated and characterised for average diameter and surface charge on its droplets using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed the formation of nanometric spherical droplets. In laboratory bioassays, mortality of S. litura larvae was 100% at 10.0 mg mL−1 and 12.50 mg mL−1 concentrations of citronella EO and its nano-emulsion, respectively. The LC50 values were 5.52 mg mL−1 on oil and 4.19 mg mL−1 on nano-emulsion. Larval feeding on leaf discs treated with citronella EO and its nano-emulsion was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The Antifeedant Index (AFI) values at 25.0 mg mL−1 of citronella oil and its nano-emulsion were 33.78 and 51.83, respectively. Both citronella EO and its nano-emulsion are potential candidates for development of botanical insecticides to control S. litura.

The insecticide concentrations tested were the same for all organisms (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 mg L−1 of Actellic 50 EC), with an exposure of 3–5–21 days for plants and 4–5–14 days for animals. The non-target organisms tested were both plants (wheat and two ferns) and animals (the Prussian carp and marsh frog tadpoles). The tested insecticide significantly inhibited the growth of roots in wheat, a result that was also confirmed by a microbiotest application (62% root growth inhibition in sorghum and 100% germination inhibition in white mustard and garden cress). In ferns, even for the lowest concentration, the percentage of germinated spores was inhibited by 40% for Asplenium scolopendrium. The recorded toxicological effects of Actellic 50 EC upon the Prussian carp included a decrease in the respiratory rate and oxygen consumption, an increase in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes, and an increase in blood glucose levels. The highest concentration (0.1 mg L−1 of Actellic 50 EC) caused a 50% decrease in the survival rate of marsh frog tadpoles after 5 days of exposure, negatively affecting body volume and length. Given the high degree of toxicity of the insecticide Actellic 50 EC, we recommend continuing investigations on non-target species, including both plants and animals, as the sub-chronic effects are quite little known in the scientific literature. © 2022 by the authors."

Two formulation agents of toxicological concern, Naphthalene and Solvent Naphtha (Petroleum), Heavy Aromatic, were simulated from their usage in commercially-applied pesticides. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate these formulation agents during 2011–2014 in the agriculturally intensive Sacramento River watershed. The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26–31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level. Since many formulation agents are widely used in pesticides throughout this and other agriculturally impacted watersheds, their potential risks in the environment need more thorough investigation by modeling and monitoring, especially for areas with heavy usage. © 2022"

The spray adjuvant ‘Jiexiaoli,’ a primary organosilicon spray agent in China, was identified as hydroxy (polyethylene) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H) with 3–15 ethoxy (EO) groups. Purification of TSS-H was achieved through semi-preparative separation using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), resulting in TSS-H purity exceeding 96%. An accurate residual detection method for nine oligomers (4–12 EO) of TSS-H in rice roots, stems, leaves, and culture solution samples was developed using HPLC tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Recoveries for nine oligomers of TSS-H in the four matrices ranged from 80.22% to 104.01%. Foliar application experiments demonstrated that TSS-H did not transfer from the upper to the lower parts of the rice plant. The half-lives of each oligomer (4–12 EO) in leaves were less than 3.21 days. Root application experiments revealed a root concentration factor (RCF) ranging from 0.20 to 0.56, a biological enrichment factor (BCF) ranging from 0.36 to 0.68, a transpiration factor (TSCF) ranging from 0.069 to 0.086, and a transport factor (TF) ranging from 0.08 to 0.43. These results indicated that TSS-H could be absorbed by rice roots and conducted to the above-ground parts of rice plants.

While many (eco)toxicology studies are performed in the laboratory under highly controlled circumstances, these studies may disregard the nuances and disorder that come with the complexity of natural aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments using laboratory system water, different lake waters, and different water parameters to determine the effects of ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D (0.00–4.00 ppm a.e.) on the development and survival of two freshwater game species (Sander vitreus and Esox lucius). For 2,4-D exposures using different water sources, there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and water source on walleye embryo and larval survival, however, there was no significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and water source. For 2,4-D exposures and pH (5–9 pH), there were significant main effects of 2,4-D concentration and pH on walleye and northern pike embryo survival and a significant interaction between 2,4-D exposure and pH. Our results indicate that 2,4-D exposures in controlled laboratory system water can predict similar outcomes as 2,4-D exposures in natural lake water. Moreover, individual water parameters, such as pH, play a significant role in the toxicity of 2,4-D. Taken together, these results suggest that highly controlled laboratory studies are a useful tool for predicting impacts on survival of non-target fish in natural waters, but it is crucial for management agencies to consider individual water sources and specific lake water parameters in herbicide risk assessments to minimize the impacts to non-target organism. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Static bioassays were performed in the laboratory to compare the acute toxicity between the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to four freshwater organisms: the crustacean zooplankton Cyclops viridis, the oligochaete worm Branchiura sowerbyi, the gastropod Pila globosa, and tadpole larvae of Duttaphrynus melanostictus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations in water after 2 h of exposure to the nominal concentrations ranged from 82.98% to 88.56%. The commercial formulation (F) of chlorpyrifos was found to be 1.94 to 2.76 times more toxic than the technical grade (T). Based on 96 h LC50 values of T and F chlorpyrifos, C. viridis was found to be most sensitive (0.56 and 0.25 μg/L) and P. globosa as most tolerant (1482 and 536 μg/L) to chlorpyrifos. Changes in LC50 values of both T and F chlorpyrifos were noted in respect of exposure hours for the three aquatic invertebrates and the tadpole larvae of the toad.

They act as agonists at postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), disrupting normal neurotransmission in target insects. Human exposure is high due to the widespread use of neonicotinoids and their residues in food. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro neurotoxicity of three neonicotinoid commercial formulations Much 600 FS® (imidacloprid 600 g L-1), Evidence 700 WG® (imidacloprid 700 g kg-1), and Actara 250 WG® (thiamethoxam 250 g kg-1) in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Methods: Cells were incubated with the pesticides for 96 h, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated through the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-Thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-Tetrazolium·bromide (MTT) reduction and neutral red (NR) uptake assays. Toxicological pathways such as reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell death mode, and the expression of the pro-Apoptotic protein Bax were also evaluated. Results: EC50 values of 266.4, 4,175, and 653.2 mg L-1 were found for Much®, Evidence® and Actara®, respectively. Significant increases in ROS and RNS generation were observed for all pesticides, while mitochondrial membrane potential and Bax protein expression showed no significant changes. Analysis of cell death mode revealed an increase in early apoptotic cells. Conclusion: Therefore, neonicotinoid insecticides are potentially neurotoxic, reinforcing concerns about human exposure to these commercial formulations.  © 2024 The Author(s)."
Ren Y.; Li Q.; Lu L.; Jin H.; Tao K.; Hou T.,Isochamaejasmin induces toxic effects on Helicoverpa zea via DNA damage and mitochondria-associated apoptosis,2021,Pest Management Science,77,557,567,10.1002/ps.6055,"BACKGROUND: Stellera chamaejasme L. is a poisonous plant with rich resources and is thus highly valuable in terms of new pesticide development. Isochamaejasmin (ICM), one of the main ingredients in S. chamaejasme has drawn much attention owing to its antitumour properties. However, the toxicity and mode of action of ICM on insects are still not clear. In this article, the larva and neuronal cell (AW1) of Helicoverpa zea were used to clarify the insecticidal activity of ICM as well as its toxic mechanism at the cellular level. RESULTS: The results confirmed that ICM has potential toxicity against H. zea both in vivo and in vitro via time- and dose-dependent manners. Moreover, we found that ICM caused DNA damage and increased the levels of γH2AX and OGG1 in AW1 cells. Results also showed decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 expression resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3/9, and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) as a result of exposure to ICM. Additionally, a dose-dependent rise in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, accumulation of a lipid peroxidation product, and inactivation of antioxidant enzymes were found in ICM-treated cells. CONCLUSION: These findings confirmed the insecticidal activity of ICM. Furthermore, the results revealed that ICM could cause DNA damage and induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway in AW1 cells. This study provides the basic information needed to understand the toxicity and mechanisms of action of ICM, which could potentially be used to develop it as a new insecticide. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry"

Materials and Methods: Transport of atrazine from aqueous solution and from commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products was assessed using excised nasal mucosal tissues. The permeation rate and the role of membrane transporters in the uptake of atrazine across the nasal mucosa were also investigated. Histological examination of the nasal tissues was conducted to assess the effects of commercial atrazine-containing products on nasal tissue morphology. Results: Atrazine showed high flux across both nasal respiratory and olfactory tissues, and efflux transporters were found to play an essential role in limiting its uptake at low exposure concentrations. Commercial atrazine-containing herbicide products showed remarkably high transfer across the nasal tissues, and histological evaluation showed significant changes in the morphology of the nasal epithelium following exposure to the herbicide products. Discussion: Lipophilic herbicides such as atrazine can freely permeate across the nasal mucosa despite the activity of efflux transporters. The adjuvant compounds in commercial herbicide products disrupt the nasal mucosa’s epithelial barrier, resulting in even greater atrazine permeation across the tissues. The properties of the herbicide itself and those of the formulated products play crucial roles in the potential for the enhanced neurotoxicity of herbicides following nasal inhalation. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Glyphosate is marketed in numerous glyphosate-based herbicide formulations (GBHs) that include co-formulants to enhance herbicidal effect of the active ingredient, but are declared as inert substances. However, these other ingredients can have biologic activity on their own and may interact with the glyphosate in synergistic toxicity. In this study, we focused to compare the cytogenetic effect of the active ingredient glyphosate and three marketed GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480, and Glyfos) by investigating cytotoxicity with fluorescent co-labeling and WST-1 cell viability assay as well as genotoxicity with cytokinesis block micronucleus assay in isolated human mononuclear white blood cells. Glyphosate had no notable cytotoxic activity over the tested concentration range (0–10,000 μM), whereas all the selected GBHs induced significant cell death from 1,000 μM regardless of metabolic activation (S9). Micronucleus (MN) formation induced by glyphosate and its formulations at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (0–100 μM) exhibited a diverse pattern. Glyphosate caused statistically significant increase of MN frequency at the highest concentration (100 μM) after 20-h exposure. Contrarily, Roundup Mega exerted a significant genotoxic effect at 100 μM both after 4- and 20-h exposures; moreover, Glyfos and Fozat 480 also resulted in a statistically significant increase of MN frequency from the concentration of 10 μM after 4-h and 20-h treatment, respectively. The presence of S9 had no effect on MN formation induced by either glyphosate or GBHs. The differences observed in the cytotoxic and genotoxic pattern between the active principle and formulations confirm the previous concept that the presence of co-formulants in the formulations or the interaction of them with the active ingredient is responsible for the increased toxicity of herbicide products, and draw attention to the fact that GBHs are still currently in use, the toxicity of which rivals that of POEA-containing formulations (e.g., Glyfos) already banned in Europe. Hence, it is advisable to subject them to further comprehensive toxicological screening to assess the true health risks of exposed individuals, and to reconsider their free availability to any users. © Copyright © 2021 Nagy, Argaw Tessema, Szász, Smeirat, Al Rajo and Ádám."
Zhou N.; Li R.; Lu J.; Cheng J.; Xu W.; Tao L.; Zhang Y.,Effects of Glyphosate on Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Developmental Toxicity,2025,Environmental Toxicology,,,,10.1002/tox.24503,"Glyphosate has been widely used in agricultural production as a highly effective, low-toxic, broad-spectrum organophosphorus herbicide. However, there has been controversy about whether it is toxic to the nervous system. In order to explore this issue in depth, the present study analyzed the molecular mechanism of action of glyphosate from four perspectives, namely, gene regulation, protein expression, morphological changes, and behavioral changes, and assessed the potential effects of glyphosate on the development of the nervous system of zebrafish through the establishment of a zebrafish model. The results showed that zebrafish embryos at 6 hpf after fertilization were exposed to glyphosate until 72 and 120 hpf. After exposure, it was found that the central nervous development-related gene Elavl3 was down-regulated, and GAP-43, Neurog1, and GFAP were up-regulated. The expression of HuC protein, which is used to maintain neuronal axonal homeostasis, was significantly reduced, and the expression of GFAP protein, which is used to repair neurological damage and inflammation, was significantly increased. Under the regulation of related genes and proteins, zebrafish larvae show abnormal changes during the development of a series of nervous systems such as heart rate slowing, somite shortening, spinal and brain malformations. At the same time, the zebrafish's action behavior also changed, with a significant decrease in its total time share in the low-speed shift and high-speed shift states, and a delayed response to dark-light environmental stimuli. In summary, studies have shown that glyphosate exposure may induce damage and inflammation of the zebrafish nervous system, resulting in developmental malformations, abnormal motor behavior, and potential neurotoxicity. Therefore, the possible neurotoxicity and environmental risks of glyphosate to aquatic animals should not be ignored and should be of great concern. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
Schuhmann A.; Scheiner R.,A combination of the frequent fungicides boscalid and dimoxystrobin with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in field-realistic concentrations does not affect sucrose responsiveness and learning behavior of honeybees,2023,Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,256,,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114850,"The increasing loss of pollinators over the last decades has become more and more evident. Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations. In addition, the honeybee seems to be quite robust when it comes to effects of plant protection products, while wild bees might be more sensitive. © 2023 The Authors"

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al. (1986), Schmuck et al. (1994), APHA (1995), and Demetrio et al. (2014). It was concluded from the study that the emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos was more toxic than technical-grade chlorpyrifos. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."
DesJardins N.S.; Macias J.; Soto Soto D.; Harrison J.F.; Smith B.H.,‘Inert’ co-formulants of a fungicide mediate acute effects on honey bee learning performance,2023,Scientific Reports,13,,,10.1038/s41598-023-46948-6,"Managed honey bees have experienced high rates of colony loss recently, with pesticide exposure as a major cause. While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing pesticide risks. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) the effects of the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, on the freshwater copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi; and (ii) the survival and the feeding rate of copepods after the exposure. Acute toxicity tests using the commercial formulations of fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, were performed. The LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h of fipronil to N. iheringi were 2.38 ± 0.48, 3.08 ± 1.14, and 4.97 ± 3.30 μg L−1, respectively. For 2,4-D the LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h were 371.18 ± 29.20, 406.93 ± 53.77, and 478.24 ± 107.77 mg L−1, respectively. Morphological damages on the copepods exposed to pesticides were observed at all concentrations. Fungal filaments covering dead organisms were presented at the treatment highest concentration (R5:7.43 ± 2.78 μg L−1 fipronil). The mixture of the pesticides presented synergistic effects on the mortality of N. iheringi. Post-exposure tests showed no difference between the treatments and the control on the mortality and on the feeding rate for 4 h. However, since delayed toxicity of pesticides can occur, longer post-exposure tests using N. iheringi should be tested. N. iheringi is a key species in the aquatic Brazilian ecosystem and showed sensitivity to fipronil and 2,4-D; thus, more studies with this species assessing other responses are recommended. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In response to these concerns, we have purified the active components of these adjuvants, specifically a series of oligomers of hydroxy(polyethyleneoxy) propyl-heptamethyl trisiloxane (TSS-H), including ethylene oxide (EO) units ranging from 4 to 12. For analysis of TSS-H in zebrafish and water, a method utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC[sbnd]HRMS) was developed. The findings revealed that at total TSS-H concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 mg/kg, the average recovery rate of TSS-H containing 4 to 12 EO units in zebrafish ranged from 81.2 % to 107.2 %, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) between 0.1 % and 8.4 %. The 96-hour LC50 of TSS-H in zebrafish was 6.71±0.04 mg/L. At exposure concentrations of 0.0671 mg/L and 0.671 mg/L, TSS-H oligomers reached a steady state in zebrafish within 14–21 days, with concentrations ranging from 0.008 to 0.05 mg/kg and 0.018 to 0.348 mg/kg, respectively. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for TSS-H oligomers (4–12 EO units) were 1.87–11.59 at the low dose and 0.79–9.19 at the high dose after 14 days. The elimination half-lives of the oligomers were <2.37 days during the elimination phase. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed both TSS-H doses significantly impacted lipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, with disruptions largely associated with abnormal energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and alterations in membrane composition. These findings are critical for assessing the food safety and environmental risks of agrochemical organosilicone spray adjuvants in fish. © 2025"

According to studies investigating the nutritional value and health effects of organic and conventional foods, it is known that organic and conventional foods do not have significant differences in terms of nutritional value, but pesticides and other residues used in the production of conventional foods have negative effects on health. When the results of studies comparing the effects of pesticide levels—antibiotic ratio, heavy metal, mycotoxin, nitrate and nitrite content of organic and conventional foods—on human health are examined, it has been seen that organic foods are more effective in terms of health protection and improvement compared to conventional foods. Due to the insufficiency of the existing studies, it cannot be concluded that organic foods have more beneficial effects on health than conventional foods. For this reason, further studies are needed on this subject. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, José Manuel Lorenzo and Birsen Yilmaz; individual chapters, the contributors."

With more intensive pesticides use per unit area/surface in horticultural productivity, there is a higher impact on environmental contamination and workers’ health. Considering that exposure to various pesticide and pesticide mixtures represents an additional genotoxic risk, the appropriate characterization of exposure, confounding factors and the risk itself are very much needed. We compared genetic damage in 42 horticulturists and 46 unexposed controls (Nativitas, Tlaxcala) using alkaline comet (whole blood) and micronucleus (MN) test with nuclear abnormalities (NA) (buccal epithelial cells). Workers demonstrated significantly higher levels of damage (TI%=14.02 ± 2.49 vs. 5.37 ± 0.46; MN=10.14 ± 5.15 vs. 2.40 ± 0.20), with more than 90% of them not using protective clothing nor gloves during application.

Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered ‘bee safe’ by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup®) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup® products, the consumer products Roundup® Ready-To-Use and Roundup® No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup® ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol®. Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup® Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup® Ready-To-Use® and 30% mortality with Roundup® ProActive®, over 24 hr. Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup® No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup® Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup® products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup® products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup® products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

Sprinkle R.H.; Payne-Sturges D.C.,"Mixture toxicity, cumulative risk, and environmental justice in United States federal policy, 1980–2016: Why, with much known, was little done?",2021,Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source,20,,,10.1186/s12940-021-00764-5,"Toxic chemicals — “toxicants” — have been studied and regulated as single entities, and, carcinogens aside, almost all toxicants, single or mixed and however altered, have been thought harmless in very low doses or very weak concentrations. Yet much work in recent decades has shown that toxicants can injure wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans following exposures previously expected to be harmless. Additional work has shown that toxicants can act not only individually and cumulatively but also collectively and even synergistically and that they affect disadvantaged communities inordinately — and therefore, as argued by reformers, unjustly. As late as December 2016, the last full month before the inauguration of a president promising to rescind major environmental regulations, the United States federal environmental-health establishment, as led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), had not developed coherent strategies to mitigate such risks, to alert the public to their plausibility, or to advise leadership in government and industry about their implications. To understand why, we examined archival materials, reviewed online databases, read internal industry communications, and interviewed experts. We confirmed that external constraints, statutory and judicial, had been in place prior to EPA’s earliest interest in mixture toxicity, but we found no overt effort, certainly no successful effort, to loosen those constraints. We also found internal constraints: concerns that fully committing to the study of complex mixtures involving numerous toxicants would lead to methodological drift within the toxicological community and that trying to act on insights from such study could lead only to regulatory futility. Interaction of these constraints, external and internal, shielded the EPA by circumscribing its responsibilities and by impeding movement toward paradigmatic adjustment, but it also perpetuated scientifically dubious policies, such as those limiting the evaluation of commercial chemical formulations, including pesticide formulations, to only those ingredients said by their manufacturers to be active. In this context, regulators’ disregard of synergism contrasted irreconcilably with biocide manufacturers’ understanding that synergism enhanced lethality and patentability. In the end, an effective national response to mixture toxicity, cumulative risk, and environmental injustice did not emerge. In parallel, though, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which was less constrained, pursued with scientific investigation what the EPA had not pursued with regulatory action. © 2021, The Author(s)."

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment. © 2023 by the authors."

This study aimed to assess the effects of four common pesticides on the microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata: DIAZINON® 25% C. E., Roundup®, URBACIN® 20C. E., and VAPODEL® 20% C. E., which are commercial formulations of diazinon, glyphosate, dichlorvos, and cypermethrin, respectively. According to 96-h inhibition of population growth bioassays, the four pesticide toxicities exemplified the following order: DIAZINON® (diazinon) > Roundup® (glyphosate) > VAPODEL® (dichlorvos) > URBACIN® (cypermethrin). Increasing pesticide concentrations elicited alterations in the specific growth rates (µmax). The macromolecule contents and photosynthetic pigments increased in groups exposed to the highest concentrations of DIAZINON® 25%, Roundup®, and URBACIN® 20 compared to the control group, despite these treatments inducing lower population growth rates. VAPODEL® 20% induced higher growth rates and lower macromolecule content compared to the control. Since active ingredients were not quantified, certain comparisons may prove limiting, but it is important to assess the effects of the whole mixtures in the form that they enter the environment, especially for urban-intended applications or generic formulations with higher additive contents. Finally, this study demonstrated that commercial pesticide formulations designed for urban applications might pose a threat to freshwater microalgae due to their underestimated toxic potential, but further studies are required. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, despite the advantages presented, much has been discussed about their harmful effects on exposed organisms, either directly or indirectly, with regards to endocrine disruption. This study aimed to evaluate the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid (IMD) and abamectin (ABA) formulations, separately and combined, on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at different developmental stages. For this, Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) tests were carried out, exposing two hours post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish to 96 hours of treatments with five different concentrations of abamectin (0.5–11.7 mg L−1), imidacloprid (0.0001–1.0 mg L−1), and imidacloprid/abamectin mixtures (LC50/2 − LC50/1000). The results showed that IMD and ABA caused toxic effects in zebrafish embryos. Significant effects were observed regarding egg coagulation, pericardial edema, and lack of larvae hatching. However, unlike ABA, the IMD dose-response curve for mortality had a bell curve display, where medium doses caused more mortality than higher and lower doses. These data demonstrate the toxic influence of sublethal IMD and ABA concentrations on zebrafish, suggesting that these compounds should be listed for river and reservoir water-quality monitoring. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Our aim was to improve the sensitivity of their δ13C analysis and demonstrate the feasibility of measuring them in natural surface water. Methods: The δ13C values of dissolved glyphosate and AMPA were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) (Delta V Plus instrument) coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) unit, where glyphosate and AMPA were separated on a Hypercarb column. Results: We demonstrated an improved sensitivity of the δ13C analysis for glyphosate and AMPA by LC/IRMS compared with previous studies. For waters from the carbonate and silicate hydrofacies, while no pretreatment was required for the isotope analysis of glyphosate, removal by H3PO4 acidification of dissolved inorganic carbon, that co-elutes with AMPA, was required prior to its analysis. We successfully tested a freeze-drying pre-concentration method showing no associated isotope fractionation up to concentration factors of 500 and 50 for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of measuring the δ13C values of glyphosate and AMPA in natural surface waters with contrasted hydrofacies (calcium carbonate and silicate types). This opens new fields in pesticide research, especially on the characterization of processes that control their degradation and the production of their secondary byproducts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
Dórea J.G.,Exposure to environmental neurotoxic substances and neurodevelopment in children from Latin America and the Caribbean,2021,Environmental Research,192,,,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110199,"Environmental (and occupational) exposure to neurotoxic substances is a worldwide problem that can affect children's neurodevelopment (ND). In Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries there are over 300 million children living under the threat of neurodevelopmental delays due to toxic environmental exposure. Large industrial centers, intense mining and agricultural activities, along with changing complex ecosystems constitute a mosaic that drives contamination of air, water and the food chain. Neurotoxic contaminants such as pesticides (organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and manganese fungicides), chemicals of industrial use (phthalates), and metals (Hg, Pb, Al, As, F, Cd, Mo, Mn) are at the center of environmental exposure studies. Exposure to neurotoxic substances singly or in combination with other compounds or socioeconomic stressors (maternal education, socio-economic and nutritional status) intertwined with occupational and para-occupational exposure can affect ND (motor, cognition, behavior) of children. Significant negative effects of pesticides and neurotoxic elements on ND were found in all studied countries, affecting especially the less-privileged children from laboring families. Studies showed that exposures to the neurotoxicants in human milk are secondary to their more lasting effects during prenatal exposure. This review integrates exposure (prenatal and breastfeeding), metabolism, and ND effects of neurotoxicants. It highlights the overwhelming evidence showing that current levels of exposures are hazardous and detrimental to children's ND in LAC countries. The evidence indicates that a reduction in neurotoxicant exposure is essential to protect children's ND. Therefore, it is urgent to adopt policies and actions that prevent and remediate region-specific children's ND issues. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

The standard Enchytraeid Reproduction Test was used to assess effects on survival and reproduction. Results showed that Amistar was more toxic than Prosaro, particularly for reproduction (EC50 = 161 mg Amistar/kg soil, EC50 = 350 mg Prosaro/kg soil). For both FPs, reproductive effects were mainly related to one of its a.i. (s) (azoxystrobin [EC50 = 37 mg azosxystrobin/kg soil] for Amistar, and tebuconazole [EC50 = 41 mg tebuconazole/kg soil] for Prosaro), while lethal effects were not predicted by the toxicity of its a.i. (s) (particularly in the case of Prosaro, which was more toxic than its a.i. (s)). These findings highlight the need to further explore the toxicity data of the FPs compared to the a.i. (s), aiming to predict a more realistic environmental hazard of pesticides. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Given its several benefits, FIP is widely used in the agricultural and veterinary medicine fields, but its indiscriminate use can have ecotoxic effects on non-target species. Thus, the current study aimed to summarise and critically analyse FIP's ecotoxicity in aquatic animals. Data referring to bibliometric parameters (publication year and geographical distribution), experimental conditions (field and laboratory, FIP type, animal class, species, habitat, and exposure conditions), and biomarkers (oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurotoxicity, and morphological changes) were summarised and critically analysed. Ecotoxicological studies were mainly conducted with insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Exposure to pure FIP or FIP-based commercial formulation can induce mortality and have sublethal effects on non-target organisms, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage, genotoxicity (DNA damage), neurotoxicity, and morphological changes. The herein reviewed data have evidenced high median lethal FIP concentration (LC50) in vertebrates in comparison to invertebrates. The current findings confirmed that FIP can have several effects on aquatic organisms, besides suggesting potential ecotoxicological risks posed by this insecticide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Analysis of ToxCast data for dichloroacetamide safeners with the ToxPi tool identified benoxacor as the safener with the highest potential for toxicity, especially liver toxicity. Benoxacor was subsequently administered to mice via oral gavage for 3 days at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg bodyweight (b.w.). Bodyweight-adjusted liver and testes weights were significantly increased in the 50 mg/kg b.w. group. There were no overt pathologies in either the liver or the intestine. 16S rRNA analysis of the cecal microbiome revealed no effects of benoxacor on α- or β-diversity; however, changes were observed in the abundance of certain bacteria. RNAseq analysis identified 163 hepatic genes affected by benoxacor exposure. Benoxacor exposure expressed a gene regulation profile similar to dichloroacetic acid and the fungicide sedaxane. Metabolomic analysis identified 9 serum and 15 liver metabolites that were affected by benoxacor exposure, changes that were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. The activity of antioxidant enzymes was not altered by benoxacor exposure. In vitro metabolism studies with liver microsomes and cytosol from male mice demonstrated that benoxacor is enantioselectively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and glutathione S-transferases. These findings suggest that the minor toxic effects of benoxacor may be due to its rapid metabolism to toxic metabolites, such as dichloroacetic acid. This result challenges the assumption that inert ingredients of pesticide formulations are safe.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Organosiloxane-based adjuvants are widely used as additives for daily chemicals and textile products, but also as agrochemical adjuvants in agriculture due to their super spreading and penetrating abilities. At present, China’s production and sales of silicone products have reached above 2 million tons, accounting for more than 50% of the world’s total amount. China has become the world’s largest producer, consumer and net exporter of raw materials of silicone, and the production capacity of polysiloxane has reached more than 60% of the world’s total. As organosiloxane residues detected in environment (especially in water, sludge/soil and other environmental samples, aquatic food chain, as well as human tissues), their impacts on agricultural ecological environment are increasingly exposed due to the widely application of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, while the environmental risks from silicone-based agrochemical adjuvants, including ecotoxicity and environmental safety risks, have also attracted great concern. In recent years, volatile cyclomethylcyclosiloxanes (such as D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), D5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) and D6 (dodecylcyclohexasiloxane)) have been recognized as emerging organic pollutants, or listed as priority controlled chemicals by EU and other countries, because of their environmental persistence, bioaccumulation and potential toxicity. Based on the relevant scientific research literatures published since 1991 on the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants and the ecological environmental safety risks in the use of organosiloxane-based adjuvant (including organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants), this paper reviewed and analyzed the environmental residues of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and their impacts directly or indirectly on agricultural ecological environmental safety. This review mainly focused on the following two aspects: (1) the organosiloxane residues in environment and their impacts on the agricultural ecological environment safety, including organosiloxane residues and fates in the process of wastewater treatment, aquatic food chain pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in water, soil ecological pollution risks from organosiloxane residues in sludge, and human health risks from organosiloxane residues in food; (2) the current situation and environmental safety risks for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, including organosiloxane residues and ecotoxicity risks from siloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants, and the management for the use of organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants. This paper also discussed the management status and problems associated with siloxane-based products. For organosiloxane as agrochemical adjuvants, organosiloxane-based adjuvants were largely assumed to be “biologically inert”, and usually no risk assessment (such as ecotoxicity test and environmental monitoring) was required. Also, the adjuvant inert ingredients were generally protected as “trade-secrets” or confidential business information, and the inert ingredients were rarely identified on product labels. At present, there are no regulatory requirements for the use of organosilicone-based adjuvants in fertilizer products as agrochemical adjuvants (such as foliar fertilizer additives) in China, posing potential environmental safety risks. This paper discussed that over-addition with organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants might increase their residues in soil-crop-water systems, and their ecotoxicity risks, as well as potential threats to food safety and human health. It is suggested that relevant management and research units need to pay more attention to environmental monitoring for organosiloxane residues and fates in the application process of organosiloxane-based adjuvants, and especially strengthen the research on the impacts of organosiloxane residues from organosiloxane-based agrochemical adjuvants on water, soil, animal and plant growth, as well as human health. © 2024 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

Using an innovative system (Heterogeneous Multi-Habitat Test System - HeMHAS) that allows the simulation of different scenarios within a spatially heterogeneous landscape, the effects on the habitat selection of Danio rerio fish caused by the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D were studied as single compounds and in mixture and integrated with air temperature variation (20, 24 and 28 °C). As a result, D. rerio detected and avoided both pesticides at air temperatures of 20 and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C no significant difference was observed in habitat choice by fish. Additionally, when pesticides were mixed in a heterogeneously contaminated landscape, it was observed that D. rerio detected contamination and preferred the clean zone at 20 and 24 °C; however, at 28 °C the potential to escape from the most contaminated areas was impaired. Thus, contamination by both pesticides made the habitat selection behavior of fish at 20 and 24 °C more noticeable. In addition, the association between pesticides and temperature showed negative effects on the response of fish to detect and escape from contaminated environments, suggesting the influence of temperature in altering the ability of the organism to provide an efficient response to stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

For this reason, farmers are constantly using different fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals to increase crop yield. Although this may increase productivity, the quality of the crop is getting decreased day by day due to excessive use of pesticides. While harvesting, the pesticides that were used by the farmers get stored in the vegetables. A large number of fertilizers and pesticides set foot in the food chain and finally cause biological magnifications. People consume the same food and this affects their health in a noxious way. So, there is a need for one device that could detect these chemicals and pesticides. By using this device consumers can get to know the amount of pesticide that a product contains. This chapter consists of an electronic device that can detect the pesticides present in vegetables with the help of infrared light. This device would show the amount of pesticide present in the food. The consumer can use the pesticide's data as a benchmark to buy the eatable things that are fit to eat. In this chapter NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetable Index) method is used to detect the presence of pesticides, and also an application is designed to store and show the data having the amount of pesticide present in a particular edible thing. The data can be easily sharable by using the application to agricultural organizations, food inspection departments and can maintain the pesticide detection records. © 2023 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

Nevertheless, glyphosate has been shown to bioaccumulate in the tissues of several organisms. To understand the bioconcentration dynamics of glyphosate in fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta forma fario) of different age were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, the formulation Roundup® LB Plus, and the major transformation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) for two, three, or four weeks at different temperatures in the laboratory. Mortality rates were determined, and tissue samples were collected at the end of the experiment to ascertain concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA residues by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Results: Brown trout mortality during exposure to glyphosate or AMPA was considerably higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C. Also, a significant increase in glyphosate concentrations in samples containing muscle, head, backbone, and caudal fin tissue with increasing exposure concentrations and temperatures was observed. Six-month-old fish contained more glyphosate per kg wet weight after exposure than ten-month-old fish. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for glyphosate and AMPA were much higher at 15 °C than at 7 °C, but in both cases decreased with higher glyphosate concentrations. The BCF for glyphosate formulated in Roundup® was higher than the one for the parent compound. Approximately 30–42% of the organ-absorbed glyphosate and AMPA remained in the tissues even when the fish were kept in clean water lacking the test substances for three weeks after termination of exposure. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that there is an interaction between glyphosate and ambient temperature in terms of toxicity. Further it was shown that increasing concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the surrounding media lead to significantly increased concentrations of these substances in brown trout tissues, although neither bioconcentration nor bioaccumulation of glyphosate in animal tissues is expected due to the high water solubility of this chemical. As a consequence, the uptake of glyphosate by humans through the consumption of contaminated edible fish is very likely. © The Author(s) 2024."

Studies show that compared with polymer-C3N4 (PCN) ((9.8 m2/g)), CCN has a larger specific surface area (77.1 m2/g)) and better crystallinity. Additionally, the resistance of CCN in the air is 40 MΩ, 1250 times lower than that of polymer-C3N4 (PCN) (∼50000 MΩ). Secondly, when 50 ppm toluene gas analysis flows into the CCN based gas sensor at room temperature, the gas response value is 350. The CCN based gas sensor works for 60 days, or after 25 cycles continuously, the gas response value remains at about 350 (Rg/Ra), which is due to the excellent crystallinity, optimized π conjugate system, and enhanced interlayer van der Waals of CCN. Additionally, the critical effect of crystallinity on the gas sensitivity of carbon nitride is also discussed in detail. © 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan"

Of particular interest are molecular mechanisms that mediate the start of a cascade of adverse effects. This is a review of the latest literature data on the effects and consequences of contamination of agricultural crops by pesticide residues.

To evaluate the adverse effects caused in adults of Danio rerio species exposed to the pesticides abamectin, difenoconazole, and their commercial formulations (Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC®), both isolated and in mixtures, biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in the gills of organisms exposed to sublethal concentrations. To this end, the activities of the enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), lipid hydroperoxide (LH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were measured after 48 h of exposure to the different pesticide treatments. The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations. It is concluded that the commercial formulations Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC® and their mixtures cause significant alterations in the detoxification metabolism of exposed organisms and induce oxidative stress in fish. © 2024"

However, toxic effects of pesticide mixtures on aquatic organisms and its potential underlying mechanism still remain unclear. The joint effects of fenpropathrin (FEN) and paclobutrazol (PAC) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) using diverse toxicological endpoints were investigated in the current work. Our data exhibited that the 96-h LC50 values of FEN to zebrafish at multiple life phases ranged from 0.0029 (0.0013–0.0042) to 0.16 (0.082–0.23) mg a.i. L−1, which were lower by comparison to PAC ranging from 13.16 (8.564–21.03) to 23.43 (17.94–29.91) mg a.i. L−1. Combination of FEN and PAC displayed synergistic effect on embryonic zebrafish. Activities of T-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD and CYP450 were remarkably changed in the majority of single and mixture treatments by comparison to the untreated group. The mRNA levels of 17 genes related to oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, immune system and endocrine system were assessed, and the data suggested that embryonic zebrafish were affected by both single pesticides and their mixtures. Five genes (P53, tsh, ERα, crh and cxcl-clc) showed greater alterations when exposed to pesticide mixtures by comparison to their individual chemicals. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to conduct more studies on mixture toxicities of different pesticides to explore the chemical mixtures with synergistic interactions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Non-dietary risk assessments involve estimating the amount of residue which can be transferred from plant foliage to the skin or clothes, known as dislodgeable foliar residues (DFRs). DFR data are less available than crop residue data as studies are costly and limited by seasonality. European regulatory authorities are reticent to allow extrapolation of study data to different scenarios as the contributory factors have hitherto been poorly identified. This study is the first to use a new laboratory DFR method to investigate how one such factor, pesticide formulation, may affect DFR on a variety of crops. The study used the active substance difenoconazole as both an emulsifiable concentrate (EC 10%) and a wettable powder (WP 10%) with and without adjuvants (Tween 20 and organophosphate tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate TEHP) on tomato, French bean and oilseed rape. A comparable DFR% was retained from the WP and EC formulation on most crops except for tomato, where lower DFR% was retained in the case of WP (39 ± 4.7%) compared to EC (60 ± 1.2%). No significant effect of adjuvant addition was observed for either formulation except when mixing TEHP (0.1% w/v) to the EC 10% on French bean, resulting in 8% DFR reduction compared to the EC formulation alone. This research demonstrates the value of a unique DFR laboratory technique in investigating the importance of the formulation and in-tank adjuvants as factors that affect DFR. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Trunk injection of nematicides is currently the most preferred method of control. This study aimed to evaluate the potency of the commonly used formulations of abamectin against B. xylophilus. Twenty-one formulations of abamectin were evaluated by comparing their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials against B. xylophilus. Nematodes were treated with diluted formulation concentrations in multi-well culture plates. And, populations preexposed to pre-determined concentrations of the formulations were inoculated onto Botrytis cinerea culture, and in pine twig cuttings. Potency was contrastingly different among formulations, with LC95 of 0.00285 and 0.39462 mg/ml for the most, and the least potent formulation, respectively. Paralysis generally occurred at an application dose of 0.06 μg/ ml or higher, and formulations with high sublethal toxicities caused significant paralysis levels at the tested doses, albeit the variations. Nematode reproduction was evident at lower doses of 0.00053-0.0006 μg/ml both on Botrytis cinerea and pine twigs, with significant variations among formulations. Thus, the study highlighted the inconsistencies in the potency of similar product formulations with the same active ingredient concentration against the target organism, and the need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the additives used in formulations. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology."
Schuhmann A.; Marx M.; Scheiner R.,The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicide difenoconazole can reduce the impact of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid on honeybee behavior,2025,Heliyon,11,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e43023,"Excellent cognitive abilities and perception of the environment are essential for effective food collection in central place foragers like honeybees (Apis mellifera). These abilities can be severely affected by plant protection products (PPPs). However, risk assessment of PPPs often focusses on mortality, neglecting long-term sublethal effects, which might ultimately lead to the death of entire insect colonies. While neonicotinoids targeting sucking insects in numerous agricultural plants have largely banned from the European market, they are still widespread in the rest of the world, although they have a high potential for toxicity in beneficial insects. Particularly the combination of neonicotinoids with fungicides has allegedly led to serious effects on pollinators, but detailed studies on this subject are still rare. We here investigated the effects of two frequent fungicides, the non-sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicide Cantus® Gold (active ingredients: boscalid/dimoxystrobin) and the sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicide Difcor® 250 EC (active ingredient: difenoconazole) in combination with the neonicotinoid Mospilan® (active ingredient: acetamiprid). Cognitive abilities were studied using classical olfactory proboscis extension learning (PER learning). Responses to sucrose were investigated prior to learning, because learning performance is determined by sugar responsiveness to a large degree. The neonicotinoid reduced both sucrose responsiveness and olfactory PER learning when applied at a concentration of 20 mg/l but not in the concentration of 2 mg/l. This insecticide effect persisted in combination with the non-SBI (sterol biosynthesis inhibiting) fungicide (Cantus® Gold, 1 mg/l). Unexpectedly, the effect of the insecticide disappeared when mixed with an SBI fungicide (Difcor® 250 EC, 0.9 mg/l). SBI fungicides are assumed to interact with the detoxification mechanism of honeybees and should enhance the effects of neonicotinoids by inhibiting enzymes essential for insecticide degradation. Our study demonstrates that interactions of fungicides and neonicotinoids are more complex than assumed, because the SBI fungicide leveled the insecticide effect. These findings underline the importance for intensifying research on PPP combinations. © 2025 The Authors"

When bioavailable, these chemicals pose a threat to living organisms and can induce oxidative stress (OS). In this article, attention is paid to OS and the physiological role of the antioxidant defense system. South African and international literature was reviewed to provide extensive evidence of pesticide-induced OS in non-target organisms, in vivo and in vitro. Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models. The authors conclude that it will be worthwhile for South Africa to include in vitro OS bioassays as part of a battery of tests to screen environmental matrices for biological effects. This will facilitate the development and implementation of biomonitoring programs to safeguard the South African environment. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
Tefera Y.M.; Gaskin S.; Thredgold L.; Pisaniello D.,The role of formulation co-ingredients in skin and glove barrier protection against organophosphate insecticides,2022,Pest Management Science,78,177,183,10.1002/ps.6621,"BACKGROUND: Commercially formulated pesticide products are complex mixtures of one or more active ingredients and several co-ingredients. However, the modifying effect of co-ingredients on skin uptake and glove barrier protection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to understand the role of formulation co-ingredients in skin and glove barrier protection performance against organophosphate insecticides. RESULTS: We adapted standard in vitro diffusion cell methods to test permeation kinetics of two commonly used organophosphate insecticides: dimethoate and omethoate. For spray dilutions, dimethoate and omethoate did not reach breakthrough glove permeation rate (1 μg·cm−2·min−1) and no or little skin permeation was observed for up to 8 h, regardless of formulation. For exposure conditions involving highly concentrated products, significant differences in glove permeation were observed between different formulations of dimethoate (about 1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and of omethoate (184-fold, P < 0.001). In contrast, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed between formulations in terms of skin permeation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that co-ingredients play a critical role in glove barrier protection against undiluted organophosphate insecticides, whereas their influence on skin uptake was insignificant within the exposure time tested. This implies that dermal exposure risk may vary between handling different formulated products of the same active ingredient hence recommending a common glove material for different formulations of the same chemical without careful consideration of co-ingredients and their permeation properties may not necessarily be appropriate. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."

In recent years, outbreaks involving these arboviruses have occurred, for which vaccines do not exist; therefore, disease prevention is only through vector control and personal protection. Aedes aegypti are present on every inhabited island within the Florida Keys. The resistance status of Ae. aegypti in the Florida Keys was assessed to guide knowledge of the best choice of chemical for use during an outbreak. Mosquito eggs were collected using ovitraps placed on Key West, Stock Island, Vaca Key, Upper Matecumbe Key, Plantation Key, and Key Largo. Bottle bioassays were conducted at the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District using Biomist® 30+30 (Clarke Mosquito Control Products, Inc., Roselle, IL). Further bottle testing using malathion and permethrin occurred at the CDC, Fort Collins, CO, in addition to molecular and biochemical assays. Levels of resistance varied between islands with different underlying mechanisms present. Resistance was seen to Biomist® 30+30 but not to permethrin, indicating that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) or the inert ingredients may be involved in resistance. No study has been conducted to date examining the role of PBO in resistance. Key Largo was treated the most with adulticides and expressed the highest levels of alpha and beta esterases, oxidases, glutathione-S-transferases, and frequency of the V1016I knockdown mutation from all sites tested. Knowledge of localized resistance and underlying mechanisms helps in making rational decisions in selection of appropriate and effective insecticides.

Unlike plant protection products (PPPs), adjuvants are not subjected to regulatory risk assessment. In practice, numerous combinations of PPPs and adjuvants are therefore possible. Thus, tank mixtures containing insecticides that are classified as non-hazardous to bees up to the highest approved application rate or concentration may raise pollinator safety concerns when mixed with efficacy increasing adjuvants and applied in bee-attractive crops. This study analyzes whether selected “PPP–adjuvant” combinations result in increased contact mortality and pose an elevated risk to honey bees. To answer this question, we chose six common spray adjuvants of different classes for laboratory screening. These were then tested in a total of 30 tank mixtures, each with a neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), diamide (chlorantraniliprole), carbamate (pirimicarb), and butenolide (flupyradifurone) formulation. We adapted an acute contact test (OECD Test Guideline 214) to our needs, e.g., by using a professional spray chamber for more realistic exposures. Our results showed that, in total, 50% of all combinations significantly increased the mortality of caged honey bees in comparison with individual application of insecticides. In contrast, none of the adjuvants alone affected bee mortality (Cox proportional hazard model, p > 0.05). With four of the five insecticide formulations, the organosilicone surfactant Break-Thru® S 301 significantly increased bee mortality within 72 h (for all insecticides except chlorantraniliprole). Furthermore, acetamiprid yielded the highest and second highest mortality increases from a tank mixture with the crop oil surfactant LI 700® (hazard ratio = 28.84, p < 0.05) and the organosilicone Break-Thru® S 301 (hazard ratio = 14.66, p < 0.05), respectively. To assess risk in a more field-realistic setting, field trials should be performed to provide a more realistic exposure scenario under colony conditions. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Epidemiologic research provides key information towards our understanding of the relationship between environmental exposures like EDCs and human health outcomes. Intended for researchers in disciplines complementary to epidemiology, this paper highlights the importance and challenges of epidemiologic research in order to present the key elements pertaining to the design and interpretation of an epidemiologic study on EDCs. The conduct of observational studies on EDCs derives from a thoughtful research question, which will help determine the subsequent methodological choices surrounding the careful selection of the study population (including the comparison group), the adequate ascertainment of exposure(s) and outcome(s) of interest, and the application of methodological and statistical concepts more specific to epidemiology. The interpretation of epidemiologic results may be arduous due to the latency occurring between EDC exposure and certain outcome(s), the complexity in capturing EDC exposure(s), and traditional methodological and statistical issues that also deserve consideration (e.g., confounding, effect modification, non-monotonic responses). Moving forward, we strongly advocate for an integrative approach of expertise in the fields of epidemiology, exposure science, risk assessment and toxicology to adequately study the health risks associated with EDCs while tackling their challenges. © 2021"

It is worth noting that the presence of Fe3+ enhances the dispersibility of the NMs. The water dispersibility and photostability of RTD are significantly improved after encapsulation, and a stimulus response to laccase is achieved. Leaf-washing experiments confirm the enhanced adhesion of RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs to the surface of rice plant leaves compared to that of free RTD. Fluorescently labeled NMs exhibit bidirectional transport within rice plants, and RTD@SL–DTAC–Fe NMs demonstrates better transport performance than RTD. In vitro and in vivo antifungal tests indicate that encapsulation by NMs significantly enhanced pesticide activity. Field trials demonstrate that NMs exhibited prolonged efficacy compared to RTD. Finally, the safety evaluation confirms the environmental friendliness of the NMs. This study provides valuable insight for optimizing and improving the utilization efficiency and biosafety of natural product–based pesticides. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

In the Republic of Korea, trunk injection of nematicides is the preferred method of control. In this study, the efficacy of 16 locally produced formulations of emamectin benzoate against the PWN are compared through determining their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials. Nematodes were treated with varying concentrations of the tested chemicals in multi-well culture plates, and rates of paralysis and mortality were determined after 24 h. Reproduction inhibition potential was tested by inoculating pre-treated nematodes onto Botrytis cinerea, and in pine twig cuttings. Despite the uniformity in the concentration of the active ingredient, efficacy was contrastingly different among formulations. The formulations evidently conformed to three distinct groups based on similarities in sublethal activity (group 1: LC95 of 0.00768-0.01443 mg/ ml; group 2: LC95 of 0.03202-0.07236 mg/ml, and group 3: LC95 of as high as 0.30643-0.40811 mg/ml). Nematode paralysis generally occurred at the application dose of 0.0134-0.1075 μg/ml, and there were significant differences in nematode paralysis rates among the products. Nematode reproduction was only evident at lower doses both on B. cinerea and pine twigs, albeit the variations among formulations. Group 1 formulations significantly reduced nematode reproduction even at a lower dose of 0.001075 µg/ml. The variations in efficacy might be attributed to differences in inert ingredients. Therefore, there is need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the large number of additives used in formulations. © 2023, Korean Society of Plant Pathology. All rights reserved."

In the present study, we evaluate the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of formulated 24.9% PIC-based Tordon®24K on Boana pulchella tadpoles under standard laboratory conditions. In the acute toxicity test we use mortality as the endpoint and we obtained a 48-h LC50 of 16.5 mg/L, LOEC 14.5 mg/L, and NOEC 12.5 mg/L. We determined genotoxicity in GS36 tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of 8.5 (NOEC/1.5) and 12.5 mg/L (NOEC) PIC using micronucleus frequency (MN) and oc-currence of nuclear abnormalities (AN) as endpoints. We noticed a significant increase in the frequency of MN and AN in all treatments tested at sublethal concentrations. Our findings demonstrate the genotoxic effects of this herbicide, which represent a danger to amphibians that inhabit agroecosystems. Based on the results obtained and considering that Boana pulchella is not a threatened species and has a wide distribution in the Uruguayan territory and the Pampa Biome, it could be considered a reference organism in environmental monitoring programs in the region. © 2024, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess commercial methyl eugenol along with adulterants. For this purpose, commercial methyl eugenol was adulterated with different concentrations of xylene. The Raman spectral features of methyl eugenol and xylene in liquid formulations were examined, and Raman peaks were identified as associated with the methyl eugenol and adulterant. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression analysis (PLSR) have been used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the Raman spectral features. PCA was applied to differentiate Raman spectral data for various concentrations of methyl eugenol and xylene. Additionally, PLSR has been used to develop a predictive model to observe a quantitative relationship between various concentrations of adulterated methyl eugenol and their Raman spectral data sets. The root-mean-square errors of calibration and prediction were calculated using this model, and the results were found to be 1.90 and 3.86, respectively. The goodness of fit of the PLSR model is found to be 0.99. The proposed approach showed excellent potential for the rapid, quantitative detection of adulterants in methyl eugenol, and it may be applied to the analysis of a range of pesticide products. © 2024 The Authors.

Firstly, several doses were tested by topical application on newly molted pupae and the doses of inhibition (ID) of adult emergence were determined then, two doses, 0.42 µg/pupa and 1.06 µg/pupa, corresponding to ID25 and ID50, the doses required for 25 and 50% inhibition of adult emergence, respectively. They were tested on different development parameters and cuticular thicknesses during metamorphosis. Results showed that azadirachtin significantly increased the duration of pupal development and decreased pupal weight. In addition, treatment disrupted metamorphosis and several morphogenetic types have been observed (malformed adults, partial molt and blocked molt). Lastly, azadirachtin also affected cuticular secretion by reducing the thickness of the old and the new cuticle at different ages during metamorphosis. © 2021. All Rights Reserved."

At present, microbial pesticide formulations are mainly wettable powders and suspension concentrations, which are usually produced with adjuvants such as surfactants, carriers, protective agents, and nutritional adjuvants. Surfactants can improve the tension between liquid pesticides and crop surfaces, resulting in stronger permeability and wettability of the formulations. Carriers are inert components of loaded or diluted pesticides, which can control the release of active components at appropriate times. Protective agents are able to help microorganisms to resist in adverse environments. Nutritional adjuvants are used to provide nutrients for microorganisms in microbial pesticides. Most of the adjuvants used in microbial pesticides still refer to those of chemical pesticides. However, some adjuvants may have harmful effects on non-target organisms and ecological environments. Herein, in order to promote research and improvement of microbial pesticides, the types of microbial pesticide formulations were briefly reviewed, and research progress of adjuvants and their applications in microbial pesticides were highlighted, the challenges and the future perspectives towards sustainable green adjuvants of microbial pesticides were also discussed in this review. © 2023 by the authors."

The main objective of this study was to demonstrate research trends related to the glyphosate toxicity and its main effects on human and environmental health. For this purpose, 443 articles published, from 1995 to 2020, on the platform Web of Science™ Thomson Reuters were selected. The main toxicity results related in literature are genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. The environmental effects come mostly from the contamination of groundwater and soils. Several studies have concluded that herbicide concentrations right below the official safety limits induced toxic effects. The results presented a highlighted harmful effect of glyphosate on both human and environmental health. It has been observed that countries where publish the most about the glyphosate toxicity are great investors in large-scale agriculture. It is important to ponder that these countries are in a route of ecosystem exploitation that includes not only fauna and flora, but also human beings. Unfortunately, science does not provide concise data for these pesticide disapproval in the global consumer market. It is necessary to search sustainable global interest alternatives to increase agriculture production based on peoples’ food sovereignty. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, there have been many problems caused by herbicide formulations, such as volatilization, leaching, and rain-washing loss in the process of agricultural application. Self-assembled nanotechnology is a promising strategy to solve these existing problems due to the environmentally friendly preparation process and high delivery efficiency. In this study, the stable fluorescent nanoparticles (AP NPs) based on co-assembly of acifluorfen (ACI) and poly(salicylic acid) (PSA) are constructed by using non-covalent bond interactions. The results indicate that the obtained nanoparticles with a stable fluorescence characteristic show improved physiochemical properties, such as uniform morphology, good thermal stability, low surface tension, and high retention on plants. The co-assembly can produce singlet oxygen to enhance the herbicidal activity under irradiation of light and reduce the leaching property of ACI to minimize the adverse impact on the aquatic environment. The safety evaluation of soybean seedlings indicates that AP NPs have no damage to non-target plants. In summary, the co-assembled herbicidal nano-formulation composed of ACI and PSA has high bioactivity and low environmental risks, which can be widely used in agricultural production. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Vast amounts of wastewater containing hazardous substances (e.g., pesticides, dyes, heavy metals, and drugs) are produced via multiple industrial processes. A majority of them are discharged into water endangering human health. Hence, the main aim of this chapter was to highlight the threat that is carried by pesticides, dyes, heavy metals, and drugs and present diverse methods for their removal. Exposure to these pollutants can lead to severe illnesses such as various types of cancer (e.g., lung, bladder, colorectal, liver), tumors, central nervous system disorders, dysfunctions of organs (e.g., liver, kidneys), allergies, asthma, or irritation of skin and eyes. Moreover, some of these contaminants are known to exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic activity toward the human organism. Therefore, it is very important to effectively remove harmful compounds from the environment. Numerous methods including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, immobilization techniques, ion exchange, membrane separation, coagulation, or flocculation are used for this purpose; however, adsorption is found to be the most beneficial. Thus, searching for novel adsorbents and developing the methods mentioned above can significantly improve the state of the environment and diminish the risk of dangerous human diseases. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations globally is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Though 2,4-D is used in aquatic ecosystems, no studies have investigated cellular, biochemical, and transcriptional effects or mechanisms of 2,4-D exposure on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) throughout juvenile development. Herein, we aim to evaluate the impacts of chronic ecologically relevant 2,4-D exposure on reproductive systems of fathead minnow. Juvenile fathead minnows were exposed to ecologically relevant concentrations of 2,4-D in DMA4 herbicide under laboratory conditions in a flow through system. Male plasma testosterone concentrations, testicular and ovarian histology, and differential gene expression along the HPGL axis in three tissue types (brain, liver, and gonad) were assessed after a chronic 120 day exposure period. We observed significantly decreased plasma testosterone concentration in male fish exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.50, 2.00, and 4.00 mg/L) of 2,4-D. We observed a significant increase in ovarian severity grading and oocyte atresia in female fish exposed to 4.00 mg/L. Of differential expression analysis in fish exposed to 2.00 mg/L 2,4-D in DMA4, we identified significantly decreased expression of the steroid hormone receptors ESR1, ESR2b, and AR in males. Expression of male steroidogenic genes 3βHSD and 11βHSD2 along with expression of genes regulating steroid metabolism, SULT1st2 and CBR1l were increased. Altogether, these data suggest that 2,4-D could act as an endocrine disrupting chemical that alters expression of primary genes regulating hormone receptors, steroidogenesis, and steroid metabolism along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPGL) axis. The use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to the reproductive health of non-target aquatic species. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

To identify critical knowledge gaps about pollinators, we describe the state of knowledge about responses of pollinators and their foraging and nesting resources to historical natural disturbances and new stressors in Great Plains grasslands and riparian ecosystems. In addition, we also provide information about pollinator management and research needs to guide efforts to sustain pollinators and by extension, flowering vegetation, and other ecosystem services of grasslands. Although pollinator responses varied, pollinator specialists of disturbance-sensitive plants tended to decline in response to disturbance. Management with grazing and fire overall may benefit pollinators of grasslands, depending on many factors; however, we recommend habitat and population monitoring to assess outcomes of these disturbances on small, isolated pollinator populations. The influences and interactions of drought and increasingly variable weather patterns, pesticides, and domesticated bees on pollinators are complex and understudied. Nonetheless, habitat management and restoration can reduce effects of stressors and augment floral and nesting resources for pollinators. Research needs include expanding information about 1) the distribution, abundance, trends, and intraregional variability of most pollinator species; 2) floral and nesting resources critical to support pollinators; 3) implications of different rangeland management approaches; 4) effects of missing and reestablished resources in altered and restored vegetation; and 5) disentangling the relative influence of interacting disturbances and stressors on pollinator declines. Despite limited research in the Great Plains on many of these topics, consideration of pollinator populations and their habitat needs in management plans is critical now to reduce future pollinator declines and promote recovery. © 2020"

Sanshools, which are well known as spices, are N-alkyl substituted compounds extracted from the Zanthoxylum species and have several essential physiological and pharmacological functions. Sanshools display excellent safener activity for the herbicide metolachlor in rice seedlings. However, the high cost of sanshools extraction and difficulties in the synthesis of their complicated chemical structures limit their utilization in agricultural fields. Thus, the present study designed and synthesized various N-alkyl amide derivatives via the scaffold-hopping strategy to solve the challenge of complicated structures and find novel potential safeners for the herbicide metolachlor. In total, 33 N-alkyl amide derivatives (2a–k, 3a–k, and 4a–k) were synthesized using amines and saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as starting materials through acylation and condensation. The identity of all the target compounds was well confirmed by1H-NMR,13C-NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The primary evaluation of safener activities for the compounds by the agar method indicated that most of the target compounds could protect rice seedlings from injury caused by metolachlor. Notably, compounds 2k and 4k displayed excellent herbicide safener activities on plant height and demonstrated relatively similar activities to the commercialized compound dichlormid. Moreover, we showed that compounds 2k and 4k had higher glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities in rice seedlings, compared to the metolachlor treatment. In particular, 2k and 4k are safer for aquatic organisms than dichlormid. Results from the current work exhibit that compounds 2k and 4k have excellent crop safener activities toward rice and can, thus, be promising candidates for further structural optimization in rice protection. © 2020 by the authors.

If dietary restriction of iodine was once a major global health concern, today, the processes of industrialization of food and high exposure to a wide variety of environmental chemicals may be affecting, directly or indirectly, thyroid function. The homeostasis of hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis is finely regulated through the negative feedback mechanism exerted by thyroid hormones. Allostatic mechanisms are triggered to adjust the physiology of HPT axis in chronic conditions. Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides are pesticides with controversial endocrine disrupting activities and only few studies have approached their effects on HPT axis and thyroid function. However, glyphosate has an electrophilic and nucleophilic zwitterion chemical structure that may affect the mechanisms involved in iodide oxidation and organification, as well as the oxidative phosphorylation in the ATP synthesis. Thus, in this review, we aimed to: (1) discuss the critical points in the regulation of HPT axis and thyroid hormones levels balance, which may be susceptible to the toxic action of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, correlating the molecular mechanisms involved in glyphosate toxicity described in the literature that may, directly or indirectly, be associated to the higher incidence of thyroid diseases; and (2) present the literature regarding glyphosate toxicity in HPT axis. © Copyright © 2021 Romano, Oliveira, Oliveira, Oliveira, Torres, Bargi-Souza, Martino Andrade and Romano."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of an insecticide and fungicide formulation on A. brasilense strain FP2 population by culturing and culture-independent approaches. In addition, we evaluated the impact of these pesticides on the ability of A. brasilense to promote plant growth by monitoring biometric traits (root and shoot dry mass and length) of wheat grown in Greenhouse conditions. Seed pesticide dressings, mainly fungicide, led to a significant mortality of A. brasilense over time. The ability of A. brasilense to promote wheat growth also decreased due to pesticide treatments combined with sowing delay. Considering that pesticides confer fitness advantages to the wheat in field condition, our results suggest that sowing within the first 4 h after inoculation maintain the beneficial effects of A. brasilense on wheat growth promotion. Furthermore, we conclude that inoculation and treatment of seeds with pesticides may be compatible techniques when carried out immediately before sowing. © 2021 The Society for Applied Microbiology"

The highest residues of total PAs were found in cauliflowers (average: 1.53 × 103 μg/kg, market vegetables) and spinaches (average: 3.72 × 103 μg/kg, farm vegetables), respectively. In addition, Tristyrylphenol ethoxylates (TPE) dominated the total 8 PAs concentrations in most vegetable species. Moreover, the risk assessment showed that the human health risks associated with TPE and nonylphenol (NP) exposure via vegetables for adults were acceptable, and the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of other six PAs were in the range of <0.010–0.89 μg/kg bw/day, which were less likely to pose a threat to human health. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Cox C.; Zeiss M.,"Health, Pesticide Adjuvants, and Inert Ingredients: California Case Study Illustrates Need for Data Access",2022,Environmental Health Perspectives,130,,,10.1289/EHP10634,"BACKGROUND: Many pesticide products are mixtures of multiple chemicals. These include active ingredients intended to kill pests, and so-called inert ingredients intended to improve the physical characteristics of the product. In addition, shortly before applying a pesticide product, applicators often mix adjuvants into the sprayer tank. Adjuvants are products designed to improve the performance or physical properties of a pesticide spray mixture. Manufacturers may use a particular chemical compound both as an inert ingredient within pesticide products and as a component of adjuvant prod-ucts. Nonetheless, regulations dictate that data on use are publicly available only for the portion used in adjuvants. Adjuvants are exempt from federal registration, but are defined as pesticides in California. Based on that definition, California has identified α-(p-nonylphenyl)-ω-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) (APNOHO) as the most widely used pesticide in the state, applied to more than 10 million acres annually. That quantified use includes only agricultural acres treated with adjuvants containing APNOHO. Total APNOHO use is likely higher because manufacturers also use the chemical as an inert ingredient within pesticide products, although data on such use are shielded by regulation. OBJECTIVES: We use APNOHO as a case study to demonstrate that the use of adjuvants and inert ingredients is difficult to track because relevant information is not publicly available. We synthesize information that suggests widespread agricultural use of alkylphenol ethoxylates, such as APNOHO, may pose significant human and environmental health risks. We then make recommendations for future research and policy. METHODS: We used information from California’s pesticide use reporting system and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate use of APNOHO. We used U.S. EPA and European databases, as well as published research, to identify human and environmental health hazards of APNOHO. We focused on research showing that APNOHO is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. DISCUSSION: Within California, APNOHO is applied in more than 150 adjuvant products. Nationwide, it is used as an inert ingredient in at least 650 pesticide products. Exposure to APNOHO is associated with endocrine disruption, birth defects, and aquatic toxicity. We suggest that the case of APNOHO illustrates the larger problem of a lack of publicly available data on use and toxicity of many adjuvants and pesticide inert ingredients. We recommend that researchers and regulators include adjuvants and inert ingredients when evaluating pesticide hazards, including endocrine disruption. We also recommend regulatory requirements to identify all ingredients on product labels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

We aimed to investigate molecular mechanisms associated with carcinogenicity and to examine changes in global m5C DNA methylation and cytotoxic potential in A549 lung epithelial cells in response to glyphosate and tetrachlorvinphos, and differential gene expression of m5C DNA methyltransferase genes in Sprague Dawley rats to Roundup (commercial formulation of glyphosate). Global m5C level significantly increased after 1500 μM glyphosate exposure for 24 h. We determined that exposure to tetrachlorvinphos did not significantly increase the m5C level in A549 cells for 24 h. Additionally, we did not observe significant DNA methylation alteration for both pesticides after 12 h exposure. In the animal study, we observed that DNA methyltransferase genes (DNMT3b and DNMT3a) showed significantly higher expression in Roundup-exposed rats than the control group in the liver and kidney. We also observed that a significant cytotoxic effect was determined after the treatment of the cells with higher concentrations of glyphosate and tetrachlorvinphos. Our results revealed that DNA methylation could be modified by exposure to glyphosate and that exposure to Roundup was associated with the differential expression level of m5C DNA methylation methyltransferase. Finally, exposure to both pesticides increased cytotoxicity. © The Author(s) 2021."

However, a lack of quality data impedes understanding of the problem and hampers the development of effective strategies for its management. To better understand the prevalence of unintentional acute pesticide poisoning (UAPP) in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica and the pesticides and practices involved, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 197 and 330 vegetable farmers in Trinidad and Jamaica, respectively. The findings from this study revealed a high incidence of self-reported health effects from occupational pesticide exposure, with 48 and 16% of respondents, respectively, experiencing symptoms of UAPP within the previous 12 months. Furthermore, the substantial proportion of UAPP incidents were associated with a few highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs), particularly lambda-cyhalothrin, acetamiprid, and profenofos in Jamaica, and alpha-cypermethrin, paraquat and lambda-cyhalothrin in Trinidad. Given the well-documented adverse effects of these chemicals on human health, the results of this study should be of significant concern to health authorities in Jamaica and Trinidad. This clearly indicates an urgent need for improved regulation and safer alternatives to the use of HHPs, as well as the promotion of alternatives. We provide policy recommendations and identify alternatives to HHPs for tropical vegetable production.

Because of the unique life history patterns of many amphibians with aquatic larvae that become terrestrial adults, amphibians bridge the aquatic and terrestrial habitats during their life cycles. Natural environmental factors (e.g., photoperiod, temperature) and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, agricultural and industrial chemicals) can influence metamorphosis and reproduction through disruption of the HPA, HPT, and/or HPG axes, thus affecting the opportunity to reproduce. Microplastic contamination (microbeads and microfibers) is also of concern. Disruption of sexual differentiation, metamorphosis, gonadal maturation, and reproductive behavior by human influences may be contributing to the worldwide decline and extinction of many amphibian species. Sufficient scientific information already is available that demonstrates anthropogenic factors are affecting the development, metamorphosis, and reproduction of amphibians, as well as other vertebrates and that mitigating actions should be taken now. © 2024 by Elsevier Inc.

Simonsen D.; Livania V.; Cwiertny D.M.; Samuelson R.J.; Sivey J.D.; Lehmler H.-J.,A systematic review of herbicide safener toxicity,2024,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,54,805,855,10.1080/10408444.2024.2391431,"Herbicide safeners are agrochemicals added to herbicide formulations to protect crops from herbicide damage without reducing the effectiveness of the herbicide against weeds. While safeners are typically structurally similar to their co-formulated herbicides, they are classified as ""inert"" in the United States, meaning they are not held to the same regulatory standards as the herbicides. This review systematically examines the toxicity of safeners, which is important given their large-scale global use and potential for exposure to wildlife, livestock, and humans. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature identified only seven studies examining safener toxicity. Regulatory toxicity data, compiled from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) database, included data for 9 of the 18 commercial safeners. Most safeners have low acute ecotoxicity and mammalian toxicity; however, chronic effects and the underlying mechanism are less clear. Benoxacor showed enantioselective metabolism and depletion by drug-metabolizing enzymes. In conclusion, despite the widespread use of safeners, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding their toxicity. More research is needed to fully characterize the potential risks of safeners to human health and the environment. Regulatory agencies should consider reclassifying safeners as active ingredients to ensure adequate toxicity testing and risk assessment. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results: Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions: We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Thus, the present study emphasizes upon glyphosate (GLY) induced toxicity and mitigating effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in testicular cells of caprine by using various cytotoxic and biochemical parameters. GLY was found to induce several apoptotic attributes such as pyknotic nuclei, tubular degeneration, increased vacuolization, and so on, in testicular cells. GLY also decreased the cell viability and increased the incidence of apoptosis in testicular cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as revealed by MTT assay and Fluorescence (ethidium bromide/acridine orange) assay, respectively. It also increased the level of oxidative stress as evident with an increase in lipid peroxidation and decline in antioxidant power along with the decreased enzymatic activity of different antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GST). However, NAC supplementation showed antagonistic results in GLY-treated testicular tissues with maximum amelioration at the highest dose, thereby decreasing GLY-mediated apoptosis rate and oxidative stress. Maximum amelioration was reported at 10 mM NAC concentration. Reduced GLY toxicity due to NAC will prove NAC to be an excellent approach for dealing with male reproductive toxicity at the cellular level, benefiting the mammalian reproductive status. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

Survival, reproduction and biochemical markers (cholinesterase (ChE), catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO)) were some of the endpoints evaluated. Total proteins and lipids were also studied together with energy consumption (Ec). D. magna neonates were exposed for 96 h to Kraft (2, 4, and 6 ng a.i./L) and Score (12.5, 25, and 50 µg a.i./L) for the biochemical experiments, and for 15 days to abamectin (1–5 ng a.i./L) and to difenoconazole (3.12–50 µg a.i./L) to assess possible changes in reproduction. Exposures of organisms to both single compounds did not cause effects to antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, except for LPO occurring at the highest concentration of difenoconazole tested. For ChE and CAT there was enzymatic induction in mixture treatments organisms, occurring at minor pesticides concentrations for CAT and at the two highest concentrations for ChE. There were no significant differences for total protein in D. magna but lipids showed an increase at the highest concentrations of pesticide mixture combinations. There was a significant increase of Ec in individuals of all treatments tested. In the chronic test, increased fecundity occurred for D. magna under difenoconazole exposures and mixtures. This study demonstrated that mixtures of these pesticides caused greater toxicity to D. magna than when tested individually, except for Ec. Therefore, effects of mixtures are very hard to predict only based on information from single compounds, which most possibly is the result of biological complexity and redundancy in response pathways, which need further experimentation to become better known. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here. If so-called 'inert' ingredients are, in fact, detrimental to bee health, their potential role in widespread bee declines needs urgent assessment. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

The present study focuses on evaluating the effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its formulations (Rampa® EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on non-target aquatic macrophytes. The two formulation types differ in their active ingredient release and presumed environmental impact. In order to cover different ecological traits, two species of aquatic macrophytes – the floating monocot Lemna minor and the rooted dicot Myriophyllum aquaticum, were used as test models. The results of this study revealed differences in the sensitivity of tested plants to clomazone. Based on the most sensitive parameters, M. aquaticum proved to be more sensitive than L. minor to the technical ingredient and both formulations. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach that was tried out in an attempt to create a higher tier step of risk assessment of clomazone for primary producers indicates that tests on rooted macrophytes can add value in risk assessment of plant protection products. The capsule formulation of clomazone was less toxic than the emulsion for L. minor, but more toxic for M. aquaticum. The most toxic for L. minor was the emulsifiable concentrate formulation Rampa® EC, followed by technical clomazone (EC50 33.3 and 54.0 mg a.i./l, respectively), while the aqueous capsule suspension formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS did not cause adverse effects. On the other hand, the most toxic for M. aquaticum was the formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS, followed by technical clomazone and the formulation Rampa® EC, demonstrating a greater effect of the capsule formulation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd; Aquatic macrophytes respond differently to different clomazone formulations, raising questions about the toxicity of conventional and newer formulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Here, agrochemical usage could threaten its long-term survival. We investigated, by micronucleus (MN) assay, the genotoxic effect of glyphosate, a common herbicide, on L. dispar larvae. Micronuclei (MNi) are DNA fragments separated from the main nucleus and represent the result of genomic damage that has been transmitted to daughter cells. In a control/treatment experiment, we extracted epithelial cells from last-instar larvae fed with Rumex spp. plants sprayed with a solution containing 3.6 g/L of glyphosate, and from larvae fed with unsprayed plants. MNi and other chromosomal aberrations—nuclear buds (NBUDs) and bi-nucleated cells—were then scored in 1000 cells/subject. Significant differences were found between glyphosate-exposed and control groups in terms of MNi and total genomic damage, but not in terms of NBUDs or bi-nucleated cells. We reported a possible genomic damage induced by glyphosate on larvae of L. dispar. For the first time, a MN assay was used in order to evaluate the genomic damage on a phytophagous invertebrate at the larval stage. Increased levels of MNi reflect a condition of genomic instability that can result in reduced vitality and in an increased risk of local extinction. Therefore, farmland management compatible with wildlife conservation is needed. © 2020, The Author(s)."

We have previously shown that chronic uptake of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid affects the behavior of honey bees in the field. Foraging behavior, homing success, navigation performance and social communication were impaired. Thiacloprid collected at a feeding site at low doses accumulates in foragers over time. Here, we applied a laboratory standard procedure (the proboscis-extension response conditioning) in order to assess which processes, acquisition, memory consolidation and/or memory retrieval were compromised after bees were fed either with thiacloprid or the formulation of thiacloprid named Calypso® at different sublethal doses. Extinction and generalization tests allowed us to investigate whether bees respond to a learned stimulus, and how selectively. We showed that thiacloprid, as active substance and as formulation, poses a substantial risk to honey bees by disrupting learning and memory functions. These data support and specify the data collected in the field. © 2017, Company of Biologists Ltd. All rights reserved."

These drugs, once disposed, often remain stable, even after conventional or advanced treatments. Although there have been a number of studies on the potential harm caused by drugs when released into the environment, few studies have investigated the toxicity of pharmaceutical excipients. In the present study, the acute toxicity of 30 drugs was tested to Aliivibrio fischeri. Ten different active ingredients were investigated, each in three distinct formulations: generic, similar and reference (brand drug). The aim of the study was to evaluate the harmful potential of drugs frequently sold in drugstores and to assess the contribution of excipients towards the observed acute toxicity. Within the 10 drugs evaluated, only one, dexchlorpheniramine maleate, was not toxic in any formulation. The toxicities of the three formulations were often different, even though the active ingredient has been the same. For some drugs, such as diazepam, glibenclamide, metformin, nimesulide, hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin, only one or two of the three formulations tested were toxic to A. fischeri. These results highlight the toxicological potential of drug excipients, but not exclusively the toxicity of the active ingredients. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Acute and chronic tests were conducted with diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial formulations, Diuron Nortox® 500 SC and Furadan® 350 SC, respectively. The sensitivity range of P. caudatum to reference substance sodium chloride was established. A preliminary risk assessment of diuron and carbofuran for Brazilian water bodies was performed. The tests indicated that toxicity of pure diuron and its commercial formulation was similar, while the commercial product carbofuran was more toxic than its pure form. In acute tests, readings were carried out at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and showed an increase of mortality with increasing exposure time. The sensitivity of P. caudatum to NaCl ranged from 3.31 to 4.44 g L-1, averaging 3.88 g L-1. For diuron, the 6 h LC50 was 64.6 ± 3.3 mg L-1 for its pure form and 62.4 ± 2.5 mg L-1 for its commercial formulation. Carbofuran active ingredient was less toxic than that of diuron, presenting a 6 h LC50 of 142.0 ± 2.4 mg L-1 for its pure form and 70.4 ± 2.2 mg L-1 for its commercial product. Chronic tests showed that these pesticides cause significant decrease on population growth, generation number and biomass of P. caudatum. The 24 h IC50 was 7.10 ± 0.58 mg L-1 for pure diuron, 6.78 ± 0.92 mg L-1 for commercial diuron, 22.95 ± 3.57 mg L-1 for pure carbofuran and 4.98 ± 0.62 mg L-1 for commercial carbofuran. Preliminary risk assessment indicated that diuron and carbofuran present potential ecological risks for Brazilian water bodies. P. caudatum was a suitable and sensitive test organism to evaluate diuron and carbofuran toxicity to freshwater protozooplankton and, taking into account the relevant role of protozoans in aquatic environments, we strongly recommend its inclusion in ecotoxicological studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The formulation of Roundup is speculated to have critical toxic effects, one among which is chronic inflammation. The present study analyzed adverse inflammatory effects in the liver and adipose tissue of rats after a subacute exposure of Roundup. Adult male rats were exposed to various doses of Roundup (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 mg/kg bodyweight [bw] glyphosate) orally, everyday for 14 days. On day 15, liver and adipose tissues from dosed rats were analyzed for inflammation markers. C-reactive protein in liver, cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and inflammatory response marker, and prostaglandin–endoperoxide synthase were upregulated in liver and adipose of rats exposed to higher (100 and 250 mg/kg bw/d) doses of Roundup. Cumulatively, our data suggest development of inflammation in lipid and hepatic organs upon exposure to Roundup. Furthermore, liver histological studies showed formation of vacuoles, fibroid tissue, and glycogen depletion in the groups treated with doses of higher Roundup. These observations suggest progression of fatty liver disease in Roundup-treated adult rats. In summary, our data suggest progression of multiorgan inflammation, liver scarring, and dysfunction post short-term exposure of Roundup in adult male rats. © The Author(s) 2019."
Jusaitis M.,Herbicidal control of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) in an ecologically sensitive environment,2018,Pacific Conservation Biology,24,3,11,10.1071/PC17010,"Asparagus asparagoides (bridal creeper) is a highly invasive noxious environmental weed in southern Australia. It poses a severe threat to biodiversity and conservation in temperate natural ecosystems. Pterostylis arenicola, a threatened terrestrial orchid endemic to South Australia, is directly imperilled by this weed in most of its remnant populations. The coincident growth phenologies of orchid and weed make for an ecologically sensitive environment when considering methods of weed control or eradication. To minimise impact on the orchid and its ecosystem, this paper examines the efficacy of herbicide application for A. asparagoides control using the weed wiping technique, comparing it to the conventional spray application method. The most prolonged control of A. asparagoides was achieved after a single wipe-application of 1.5g a.i. (active ingredient) L-1 metsulfuron methyl, either alone or in combination with 120g a.i. L-1 glyphosate, both treatments giving significantly better weed control five years after treatment than comparable spray applications. An investigation of the effect of glyphosate on cultures of the mycorrhizal fungus isolated from P. arenicola indicated a significant decline in mycelial growth with increasing herbicide concentration over the range 0.5-3.0kg a.i. ha-1. These results provide further incentive for the use of ecologically sensitive herbicide application techniques, such as weed wiping, in areas of high conservation concern. © 2018 CSIRO."

At the present time, they represent approximately 40% of chemical products sales, followed by insecticides, fungicides, and other types of pesticides. Among these products, commercial formulations based on N-phosphonomethyl-glycine (PMG), commonly known as glyphosate, are the most used worldwide. Such herbicidal formulations play a key role in promoting crop yields. PMG is a broad-spectrum compound that kills weeds that compete with crops in agricultural soils (such as soils for soybean and maize growth) and non-agricultural environments (such as green spaces and gardens). In the last decade, some annual broadleaf weeds have developed resistance to PMG. For this reason, it has become necessary to apply higher and repeated doses of PMG, which may lead to contamination of the environment. Some works have reported a relatively fast biodegradation of PMG in contaminated soils, with a half-life period of nearly 20 days. However, after 30-years of application of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), this herbicide and its primary degradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), still are the most frequently detected compounds in water bodies, mainly in agricultural areas. In addition to environmental pollution and human health risks, these residual compounds can have a phytotoxic effect on the next crop and become a threat to food production. Several processes act in the dissipation of organophosphorus compounds on soil, being the microbial activity one of the most relevant. Since the 1980s, applied researchers have become increasingly interested in the study of the effects of GBH on microbial communities. Although considerable research has been done on biodegradation of PMG by bacteria, much less is known regarding this capacity in fungi. Fungal species belonging to genera such as Phanerochaete, Trametes, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium and Trichoderma are able to metabolize important environmental pollutants such as herbicides. They possess a number of advantages that can be exploited in bioremediation systems. They can degrade a diverse range of persistent toxic environmental pollutants and carry out a relevant role in co-metabolic degradation processes. The persistence of PMG and AMPA in soils and aquatic sediments depends on the type of soil, tillage, and climatic conditions, among other factors. Both are polar compounds that strongly bind to Fe and Al oxides, clays and organic matter (humic acids) of the soil, decreasing the availability of free herbicide. The purpose of this chapter is to review information on the presence of GBH in the environment, their potentially harmful effects, their influence on soil microbial communities and their capacity to adsorb to clay particles (which affects their environmental availability). © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

Used principally by farmers, intoxications have increasingly been reported. We have studied R effects (containing 36 % of G) on right ventricular tissues (male Sprague–Dawley rats, up to 20,000 ppm and female New Zealand rabbits, at 25 and 50 ppm), to investigate R cardiac electrophysiological actions in vitro. We tested the reduced Ca++intracellular uptake mechanism as one potential cause of the electrical abnormalities after GBH superfusion, using the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain or the 1,4-dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 which increases ICa. R concentrations were selected based on human blood ranges found after acute intoxication. The study showed dose-dependent Vmax, APD50and APD90variations during 45 min of R superfusion. At the highest concentrations tested, there was a high incidence of conduction blocks, and 30-min washout with normal Tyrode solution did not restore excitability. We also observed an increased incidence of arrhythmias at different doses of R. Ouabain and BAY K 8644 prevented Vmaxdecrease, APD90increase and the cardiac inexcitability induced by R 50 ppm. Glyphosate alone (18 and 180 ppm) had no significant electrophysiological effects. Thus, the action potential prolonging effect of R pointing to ICainterference might explain both conduction blocks and proarrhythmia in vitro. These mechanisms may well be causative of QT prolongation, atrioventricular conduction blocks and arrhythmias in man after GBH acute intoxications as reported in retrospective hospital records. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Despite the benefits provided by agrochemicals in agriculture as well as in domestic uses, many of them may pose potential health and environmental hazards. There is now increasing interest in the determination of biomarkers that allow the measurement and estimation of an active and /or passive exposure to environmental pollutants with toxic capacity, such as pesticides. This study analyzes the DNA damage caused by Marvel® a commercial herbicide through the micronucleus (MN) assay, in meristematic cells of the root of Vicia faba. Roots between 2-3 cm were exposed for 4 hours with 18 and 44 hours of recovery time at different concentrations of Marvel®, equivalent to the following combinations of atrazine /dicamba: 62.5 /31.25; 125 /62.5; 250/125; 1000/500; 2000/1000; 3000/1500 and 4000/2000, mg of active ingredient /L of distilled water. Cells were exposed to distilled water as a negative control and potassium dichromate (0.05%) as a positive control under the same experimental conditions. With the exception of the lowest concentration [62.5 /31.25 mg of active ingredient /L of distilled water], all concentrations tested showed significant damage (p < 0.05), with respect to the negative control, the damage was greater at 18 hours of recovery, and at 44 hours the damage was decreased at all concentrations tested. The mitotic index (MI) also was affected showing a smaller division depending on concentration and recovery times. The concentrations of 2000/1000; 3000/1500 and 4000/2000, mg of active ingredient /L of distilled water produced greater damage than that found in the positive control. This leads to the conclusion that the commercial herbicide Marvel® causes DNA damage and is cytotoxic in Vicia faba. © 2018, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM. All rights reserved."

Following questions yielding from a previous study, an in-depth analysis of the reproductive toxicity of the pesticide was made. Long-term exposures of Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina to Betanal® Expert, to each a.i. and to a customised mixture matching the a.i.s ratio within the commercial formulation were carried out, and deleterious effects in the offspring were recorded. This intended to clarify whether (1) the tested compounds induce reproductive injury; (2) there is interspecific variation in daphnids tolerance to the compounds; (3) there is an interaction between chemicals in combined treatments; and (4) the so-called inert ingredients added to the commercial formulation contribute to the toxicity of the herbicide. Generally, developmental impair was observed in both species (egg abortion and release of undeveloped embryos or dead offspring) at concentrations of any of the a.i.s below 1 mg L−1. Ethofumesate was invariably the least toxic pesticide, and D. magna tended to be of slightly higher sensitivity to the exposures compared to D. longispina. Joint exposures indicated that the a.i.s can interact, inducing more than and less than additive effects for Betanal® Expert and the customised a.i. mixture, respectively. This indicates that inert ingredients co-formulating the commercial pesticide (which are absent from the customised a.i. mixture) actually contribute to its overall toxicity. This study constitutes an add-on to the discussion on the ecotoxicological framework required for authorisation of pesticide trade and usage. The results support the need to consider test species, long-term hazardous potential and toxicity of commercial formulations rather than solely that of active ingredients, as relevant variables in pesticide regulation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Transcription levels of liver vitellogenin (. vtg) differed significantly in both species amongst sites with different exposures to agricultural run-off; brain aromatase (. cyp19a1b) revealed some differences for barramundi only. Exposure to run-off from sugarcane that contains pesticides is a likely pathway given (i) significant associations between barramundi vtg transcription levels, catchment sugarcane land use, and river pesticide concentrations, and (ii) consistency between patterns of coral trout vtg transcription levels and pesticide distribution in the GBR lagoon.

During in vitro tests, isolated two-cell stage embryos were cultured in media with addition of the listed chemicals until blastocyst formation. Stereomicroscopic evaluation of in vitro produced embryos showed that fipronil at 1 μM and higher concentration negatively affected embryonic development. Fluorescence staining revealed that the obtained blastocysts displayed lower numbers of blastomeres at 10 μM concentrations and elevated incidence of cell death from 1 μM concentration. The presence of FIPRON spot-on at a concentration equivalent to 10 μM of fipronil caused massive degeneration of all embryos. Secondary ingredients (butylhydroxyanisolum, butylhydroxytoluenum) at corresponding concentrations negatively impacted the development and quality of preimplantation embryos as well. During in vivo tests (daily oral administration of fipronil during the preimplantation period) in embryos collected from treated mouse females, significantly elevated incidence of cell death was observed even at the acute reference dose. Fipronil impaired the development and quality of mouse preimplantation embryos in both in vitro and in vivo tests. Embryotoxicity of the commercial product FIPRON spot-on was potentiated by the presence of secondary ingredients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Moreover, the development and diversity of these aquatic organisms could also be affected by human-induced climate change that might lead to more periods with extreme temperatures. However, to what extent non-target effects of these herbicides on amphibians or algae are altered by varying temperature is not well known. Methods We studied effects of five concentrations of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup PowerFlex (0, 1.5, 3, 4 mg acid equivalent glyphosate L-1 as a one time addition and a pulse treatment of totally 4 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1) on larval development of Common toads (Bufo bufo, L.; Amphibia: Anura) and associated algae communities under two temperature regimes (15 vs. 20 °C). Results Herbicide contamination reduced tail growth (-8%), induced the occurrence of tail deformations (i.e. lacerated or crooked tails) and reduced algae diversity (-6%). Higher water temperature increased tadpole growth (tail and body length (tl/bl) +66%, length-to-width ratio +4%) and decreased algae diversity (-21%). No clear relation between herbicide concentrations and tadpole growth or algae density or diversity was observed. Interactive effects of herbicides and temperature affected growth parameters, tail deformation and tadpole mortality indicating that the herbicide effects are temperature-dependent. Remarkably, herbicide-temperature interactions resulted in deformed tails in 34% of all herbicide treated tadpoles at 15 °C whereas no tail deformations were observed for the herbicide-free control at 15 °C or any tadpole at 20 °C; herbicide-induced mortality was higher at 15 °C but lower at 20 °C. Discussion These herbicide- and temperature-induced changes may have decided effects on ecological interactions in freshwater ecosystems. Although no clear dose-response effect was seen, the presence of glyphosate was decisive for an effect, suggesting that the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) in our study was 1.5 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1 water. Overall, our findings also question the relevance of pesticide risk assessments conducted at standard temperatures. © 2016 Baier et al."

Acute and chronic toxicity tests were carried out with the diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial products, Diuron Nortox® 500 SC and Furadan® 350 SC, respectively. Individual toxicity tests showed that C. silvestrii was more sensitive to both carbofuran and diuron than P. caudatum. In single exposures, both pesticides caused adverse effects to C. silvestrii in environmentally relevant concentrations (48 h EC50 = 0.001 mg L−1 and 8 d LOEC = 0.00038 mg L−1 for formulated carbofuran; 8 d LOEC < 0.05 mg L−1 for formulated diuron). For P. caudatum, carbofuran and diuron in single exposures were only slightly toxic (24 h IC50 = 5.1 mg L−1 and 6.9 mg L−1 for formulated carbofuran and diuron, respectively). Acute and chronic exposures to diuron and carbofuran mixtures caused significant deviations of the toxicity predicted by the Concentration Addition and Independent Action reference models for both test species. For the protozoan P. caudatum, a dose-dependent deviation was verified for mortality, with synergism caused mainly by carbofuran and antagonism caused mainly by diuron. For protozoan population growth, however, an antagonistic deviation was observed when the active ingredient mixtures were tested. In the case of C. silvestrii, antagonism at low concentrations and synergism at high concentrations were revealed after acute exposure to active ingredient mixtures, whereas for reproduction an antagonistic deviation was found. Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures. Our results showed that carbofuran and diuron interact and cause different toxic responses than those predicted by the individually tested compounds. Their mixture toxicity should therefore be considered in risk assessments as these pesticides are likely to be present simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."
Janssens L.; Stoks R.,Stronger effects of Roundup than its active ingredient glyphosate in damselfly larvae,2017,Aquatic Toxicology,193,210,216,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.028,"Pesticides are causing strong decreases in aquatic biodiversity at concentrations assumed safe by legislation. One reason for the failing risk assessment may be strong differences in the toxicity of the active ingredient of pesticides and their commercial formulations. Sublethal effects, especially those on behaviour, have been largely ignored in this context, yet can be equally important as lethal effects at the population and ecosystem levels. Here, we compared the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on survival, but also on ecologically relevant sublethal traits (life history, behaviour and physiology) in damselfly larvae. Roundup was more toxic than glyphosate with negative effects on survival, behaviour and most of the physiological traits being present at lower concentrations (food intake, escape swimming speed) or even only present (survival, sugar and total energy content and muscle mass) following Roundup exposure. This confirms the toxicity of the surfactant POEA. Notably, also glyphosate was not harmless: a realistic concentration of 2 mg/l resulted in reduced growth rate, escape swimming speed and fat content. Our results therefore indicate that the toxicity of Roundup cannot be fully attributed to its surfactant, thereby suggesting that also the new generation of glyphosate-based herbicides with other mixtures of surfactants likely will have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological studies comparing the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations typically ignore behaviour while the here observed differential effects on behaviour likely will negatively impact damselfly populations. Our data highlight that risk assessment of pesticides ignoring sublethal effects may contribute to the negative effects of pesticides on aquatic biodiversity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Herbicides may also be teratogenic, mutagenic, cancerigenous agents and endocrine disruptors, with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases and reproduction disorders. Several studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating qualities, besides affecting the reproduction system. It is among the agents which are beneficent in poisoning by herbicides even though no reports are extant on the use of melatonin against poisoning by Glyphosate-Roundup® alone or associated with Paraquat. Solutions that prevent or minimize cell lesions caused by several biological systems have been focused upon in the treatment for poisoning with herbicides. Thus, melatonin, a known antioxidant, may be an alternative against the poisoning by single or associated herbicides."

In this study the toxicity of three pyrethroids usually applied to this crop (λ-cyhalothrin, α-cypermethrin, τ-fluvalinate) was evaluated on two bug species, the wheat bug Eurygaster maura (L.) and the green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.) in both laboratory and semi-field conditions, to implement an effective and sustainable control strategy. Laboratory trials showed small differences between the insecticides, whereas field cage trials gave more information on toxicity and persistence of the three pyrethroids. The most toxic and with good persistence on plants was α-cypermethrin, followed by λ-cyhalothrin, which had an intermediate persistence. By contrast, τ-fluvalinate showed a high persistence on plants, but seemed unsuited for wheat bug control because of its low toxicity, as clearly demonstrated in both laboratory and semi-field trials. The results provide clear information on the application strategy of the tested pyrethroids. In this context, α-cypermethrin proved to be the most promising active ingredient for wheat bug control, particularly for early application of the insecticide in a mixture with a fungicide at the wheat heading stage, eliminating the need for a separate additional treatment by the farmer. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

In other taxa, NMP is primarily detoxified via a cytochrome P450 mediated pathway. Using a LC-MS method, putative cytochrome P450 metabolites of NMP were identified and quantified in adults and larvae following chronic exposure to NMP. Major differences in the identities and quantities of the generated metabolites were observed between adults and larvae. One major difference was the higher percentage of the administered NMP recovered as the parent compound in larvae compared to adults. To further explore the apparent difference in metabolic capacity, a spectrofluorometric method was used to compare general cytochrome P450 enzyme activity by monitoring the transformation of a 7-ethoxycoumarin substrate. Higher microsomal levels of 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity in adult fat bodies suggests that the higher percentage of unmetabolized NMP in larvae relative to adults may be due to lower cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in fat bodies. Taken together, these results suggest that larvae may be less able to detoxify xenobiotics encountered in diet than adults, and these findings will help inform future risk assessment. © 2017 American Chemical Society."

The lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata is an important beneficial insect in cropland that is commonly used as an indicator species in safety evaluations of pesticides. Here, we examined the lethal and non-lethal effects of 2,4-D and dicamba active ingredients and commercial formulations to this lady beetle species, and tested for synergistic effects of the herbicides. Second instars of lady beetles were exposed to an experimental treatment, and their mortality, development, weight, sex ratio, fecundity, and mobility was evaluated. Using similar methods, a dose–response study was conducted on 2,4-D with and without dicamba. The commercial formulation of 2,4-D was highly lethal to lady beetle larvae; the LC90 of this herbicide was 13 % of the label rate. In this case, the “inactive” ingredients were a key driver of the toxicity. Dicamba active ingredient significantly increased lady beetle mortality and reduced their body weight. The commercial formulations of both herbicides reduced the proportion of males in the lady beetle population. The herbicides when used together did not act synergistically in their toxicity toward lady beetles versus when the chemistries were used independently. Our work shows that herbicide formulations can cause both lethal and sublethal effects on non-target, beneficial insects, and these effects are sometimes driven by the “inactive” ingredients. The field-level implications of shifts in weed management practices on insect management programs should receive further attention. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

However, the general intensive use of insecticides has reduced the numbers of this parasitoid. This study evaluated the effect of the residual action of 24 insecticides on T. radiata and also determined the differential toxicity of insecticides to D. citri and T. radiata, using three bioassays. In the first, when adults of the parasitoid were exposed to residues of the 24 insecticides, ten were considered short-life (class 1), six slightly persistent (class 2), five moderately persistent (class 3), and three insecticides were considered persistent (class 4), under the IOBC/WPRS classification system. The second bioassay evaluated the sublethal concentrations of the persistent insecticides (formetanate, dimethoate, spinosad). Increasing the concentrations of the insecticides increased the number that were classified as persistent. In the third bioassay, evaluation of the differential toxicity of eight insecticides to the ACP and the parasitoid showed that chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin were more harmful to T. radiata. Therefore, these two insecticides are not recommended for application at the time of parasitoid release. Cypermethrin, imidacloprid, and dimethoate caused higher mortality of D. citri and are most often recommended in IPM programs. The choice of an insecticide for the control of citrus pests must be made with care, aiming to preserve the natural enemies in the ecosystem, and thereby contribute to the success of biological control. © 2017, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil."
Slattery M.; Harper B.; Harper S.,Pesticide encapsulation at the nanoscale drives changes to the hydrophobic partitioning and toxicity of an active ingredient,2019,Nanomaterials,9,,,10.3390/nano9010081,"Given the costs associated with designing novel active ingredients, new formulations focus on the use of other ingredients to modify existing formulations. Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (γ-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of γ-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free γ-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 µg/L, 0.57 µg/L, and 0.65 µg/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of γ-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner. Recognizing the analytical and toxicological nuances of various nanosized capsules can contribute to innovation in pesticide formulations and may lead to more comprehensive pesticide regulation. © 2019 by the authors.

Although the need for the assessment of health and environmental hazards deriving from the interactions between various substances found in commercial pesticide formulations is becoming increasingly recognized, the approval of pesticide products is still mostly limited to determining the toxicity of the individual ingredients ignoring the possible combined effects in mixtures. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature of in vitro and in vivo studies that simultaneously examine the toxicity of pesticide product formulations and their declared active ingredients to compare their toxicity to human health and to the environment. Two electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the health effects of active pesticide ingredients and their product formulations. The literature search was performed with a combination of the following terms: “pesticide”, “formulation”, “commercial product”, “commercial pesticide” and “health”. After screening by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and reliability assessment of eligible publications was conducted by use of the ToxRTool. Two investigators independently screened the identified publications and extracted results from eligible studies. Our search yielded 36 toxicity studies; 23 studies investigated herbicides, 15 examined insecticides and 4 focused on fungicides. Twenty-four studies reported increased toxicity of the product formulations versus their active ingredients, which, in most cases, were attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the formulations. A significant number (n = 10) of studies focused on the comparative testing of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, and six of them concluded that Roundup, the dominant product formulation of glyphosate, is more toxic than the active ingredient alone. We identified only 8 studies demonstrating reduced toxicity of product formulations in relation to the active ingredient that might be due to a potential antagonistic effect between the constituents. The results of this review demonstrate the inadequacy of current EU testing requirements for assessing the health hazards of pesticide product formulations based mainly on the evaluation of the individual ingredients and of at least one representative use and formulation. Ignoring the possible risks deriving from the interaction between the active and other ingredients of various commercial pesticide product formulations might result in the misinterpretation of its toxicological profile. At EU level efforts are currently made to address this issue. In this context, we recommend that all product formulations should be fully assessed during the authorization process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if 'the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison'. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Amphibians inhabiting these valuable wetlands may be exposed to Bti products several times during their breeding season. Up until now, information regarding effects on the non-targeted group of amphibians has to be considered rather inconsistent. On this account, we evaluated how three repeated exposures to frequently used Bti formulations (VectoBac®12AS, VectoBac®WG) in field-relevant rates affect European common frog (Rana temporaria) larvae. In a laboratory approach, we assessed potential effects with regard to enzymatic biomarkers (glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), acetylcholine esterase (AChE)), development, body condition and survival until the end of metamorphosis. Although survival and time to metamorphosis were not significantly affected, larval development tended to be shortened in the Bti treated water phase. Furthermore, exposure to Bti induced significant increases of GST (37–550%), GR (5–140%) and AChE (38–137%) irrespectively of the applied formulation, indicating detoxification, antioxidant responses as well as an alteration of neuronal activity. GST activity increased twice as much after two repeatedly executed Bti applications within a time period of 6 days. The examination of several biochemical markers is needed to fully evaluate the ecotoxicological risk of Bti for amphibian populations, especially in the context of worldwide amphibian declines. Nevertheless, following the precautionary principle, it may be advisable to implement certain thresholds for application numbers and intervals in order to ensure environmentally friendly mosquito control programs, especially in areas designated for nature conservation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."
Lundgren J.G.,Predicting both obvious and obscure effects of pesticides on bees,2017,Beekeeping - From Science to Practice,,39,59,10.1007/978-3-319-60637-8_3,"Pesticides are a necessary component of the monoculture-based food production system. The chemical management of pests can affect non-target organisms, including honey bees. Risk assessment is a way to evaluate the cost-benefit of pesticide use to honey bees and involves understanding the exposure routes and hazards posed by each particular pesticide. The effects of insecticides on bees are intuitively recognized, but other types of pesticides can affect honey bees too. Even ""inactive"" ingredients in a pesticide formulation can pose a risk to bees. Bees encounter pesticides as they forage in the environment through direct exposure to pesticide applications, and through contaminated resources such as pollen, nectar, water, comb, and propolis. Pesticides can affect bees in myriad ways. The toxicity of pesticides is highly context-specific, challenging risk assessments. Mortality is the most commonly measured effect of pesticides on bees but sublethal effects range from developmental problems, reduced reproductive fitness, diminished overwintering capacity, and numerous behavioral issues that may not kill the bee outright, but may kill the hives. The pervasiveness of pesticides in the environment means that bees cannot avoid exposure to numerous chemicals. Selecting for bees that are adapted to agrichemical-intensive landscapes may be a short-term solution, but the dynamic evolution of chemical use may prohibit long-term tolerances. Beekeepers and farmers need to work together to create and promote reduced chemical intensive food production systems. This is the only long-term answer for the survival of honey bees and biodiversity in general. Broad scale simplification of the landscape accompanied the rise of industrial-scale food production, and a variety of agrichemicals are used to support these monoculture-based systems. Biodiversity provides substantial resistance to the proliferation of pests in a variety of ways, but this diversity is removed from our food production systems in order to maximize short-term production goals. In the absence of biotic resistance to pest proliferation, land managers rely on pesticides to replace the pest management function provided by diverse biological communities. The downside is these pesticides do not solve the causative problem that produced the pest. Within this context, pests become resistant, and more and new pesticides are required to maintain pests at low densities in a system that is designed for them to excel (i.e., the pesticide treadmill). This is the environment into which honey bees and other pollinators have been inserted, and pesticides inherent in these systems affect pollinators in complex ways. Pesticides are not intended to hurt bees or any other beneficial organisms, but they often do; estimating this harm is called risk assessment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxicity of commercial formulation of Cabrio Plus which has been inadequately evaluated. The genotoxic potential of Cabrio Plus in isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes was measured by means of an alkaline version of the comet assay (pH > 13) and in whole blood by use of the in vitro micronucleus test. Cabrio Plus induced a statistically significant increase in DNA damage assessed with the in vitro micronucleus assay and the comet assay. Cabrio Plus also induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner with the in vitro micronucleus assay. It can be concluded that a commercially available pesticide formulation, Cabrio Plus, has the ability to cause DNA damage and cytotoxicity. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Although its herbicidal potential was identified in the early 90’s, IFT is still a new active ingredient in Brazil and little is known about its effects, mainly regarding to ecotoxicity of formulated products to soil macro and mesofauna groups. This study aimed to assess behavioral, acute, and chronical effects (avoidance, lethality, and reproduction) of the commercial product ProvenceTM 750 WG (750 g a.i. L-1 isoxaflutole) on the test organisms Eisenia andrei (earthworms) and Folsomia candida (collembolans) using standardized ISO guidelines. The results showed the avoidance of the earthworm species only at >300 times the predicted field doses, as well as a decrease in reproduction over >150 times the predicted field dose. Neither the avoidance, nor lethality or reproduction response were found for the collembolan species. The laboratory results showed that it is possible to assume that ProvenceTM is not toxic to earthworms and collembolans, even at the highest field dose applied, ensuring the safety of soil communities. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

Dehnert G.K.; Karasov W.H.; Wolman M.A.,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid containing herbicide impairs essential visually guided behaviors of larval fish",2019,Aquatic Toxicology,209,1,12,10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015,"Aquatic herbicides are used worldwide to eradicate nuisance and invasive plants despite limited knowledge of their toxicity to non-target organisms. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common active ingredient in commercial herbicide formulations, which triggers plant cell death by mimicking the plant-specific hormone auxin. Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4®IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4–8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75–4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4–8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75–4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4–20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

However, the impacts of low-level 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide exposure on larval fish are not well understood. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the effects of low concentrations (0.05, 0.50, and 2.00 ppm) of 2 commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulations (Weedestroy® AM40 [WAM40] and DMA® 4 IVM [DMA4]) and pure 2,4-D on the development and survival of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) at various life cycle stages. Larval survival (30 d post hatch [dph]) was decreased following exposure of eggs and larvae to pure 2,4-D (0.50 ppm; p ≤ 0.001), as well as to WAM40 (0.50 and 2.00 ppm; p ≤ 0.001, p ≤ 0.001) and DMA4 (0.50 and 2.00 ppm; p ≤ 0.001, p ≤ 0.001). The results also narrowed the critical window of exposure for effects on survival to the period between fertilization and 14 dph. Development was not negatively altered by any of the compounds tested, although the commercial formulations increased larval total length and mass at 2.00 ppm. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems at current recommended concentrations (<2 ppm whole lake; <4 ppm spot treatment) could present risks to fathead minnow larval survival.

However, an EQS may vary with time and between countries with shared water bodies, challenging coherent risk management. This study aimed to analyze the underlying reasons for changes in EQS values following a revision of previously derived EQSs for 62 substances. Relevant data were retrieved from publicly accessible databases, available literature, registration dossiers, and, in some cases, provided by manufacturers. Ecotoxicological data were assessed regarding reliability and relevance. As in previous studies, EQS derivation followed the European Union guideline. Overall, 61 annual average EQSs (AA-EQS) and 58 maximum acceptable concentration EQSs (MAC-EQS) were derived. Size and completeness of data sets generally increased due to the revision. AA-EQSs increased in 13 cases and decreased in 21 cases. MAC-EQSs increased in 22 cases and decreased in 11 cases. Most EQSs were derived using the deterministic assessment factor (AF) method. The number of substances for which EQSs were derived probabilistically by reference to the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method increased from 2 to 5 AA-EQSs and from 6 to 11 MAC-EQSs. For AA-EQS derivation, AFs were reduced in 14 cases and increased in 6 cases. For MAC-EQS derivation, AFs were reduced in 9 cases and increased in 2 cases. Results demonstrate that the revisions did not generally lead to either lower or higher EQSs. The majority of EQSs (>93%) changed less than 10-fold. Clearly, EQSs based on small or incomplete data sets with large AFs were more prone to considerable changes in their numeric values when revised than EQSs based on SSDs. Thus, revision can reduce uncertainty and increase robustness of an EQS. In this study, however, available data continued to be insufficient to construct SSDs for the majority of substances. This was mostly due to a lack of reliable data. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;00:1–13. © 2019 SETAC. © 2019 SETAC"

The endpoints included: bioluminescence, total protein content, activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP1A and CYP1B, and expression of several genes encoding different CYP enzyme isoforms. Toxicity of PPP was compared with the toxicity predicted using concentration addition model. Cypermethrin disturbs the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase. Induction of CYP1A1-, CYP1A2- and CYP1B1-associated activity was more pronounced in PPP than in cypermethrin treatment. The predominant biotransformation pathway of cypermethrin is related to Cyp3a1 induction. Deviations between observed and predicted toxicity of PPP indicate synergistic effects of cypermethrin and a solvent. In vitro cellular assays may serve as rapid pre-screening tool and provide for a good indication of mixture effects and prompt further in vivo testing of PPPs when really needed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Roundup Original® (RO) contains an isopropylamine glyphosate (GLY) salt containing the surfactant POEA, while Roundup Transorb R® (RTR) contains a potassium salt of GLY with unknown surfactants. Both contain different compositions of so-called ""inert"" ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate (V·O2 - mLO2 Kg1 h-1) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) V·O2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced V·O2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O2 diffusion distance to O2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased V·O2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of ""inert"" compounds and surfactants. V·O2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in V·O2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

Vitamin E pretreatment did not modify the effect. Decreased cell viability was observed only in Twin Pack Gold®-treated cultures and was significantly ameliorated by vitamin E. Post-treatment of herbicide-damaged CHO-K1 cells with the enzymes Endo III or Fpg did not increase FLC-, Twin Pack Gold®-, or Rainbow®-induced DNA damage. These results demonstrate that neither FLC nor FLC-based formulations induce DNA damage through hydroxyl radical or lipid alkoxyl radical production, and that the induced DNA lesions were not related to oxidative damage at the purine/pyrimidine level. Our observations strongly suggest that the cytotoxic effects observed after Twin Pack Gold® exposure are due to the excipients contained within the technical formulation rather than FLC itself. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The mechanisms of action related to its exposure, relevant both in animals and humans, are still insufficiently investigated. This comprehensive study focused on the outcomes of terbuthylazine exposure at cell level in vitro, and a mice model in vivo. Experiments in vitro were conducted on whole human peripheral blood, isolated lymphocytes, and HepG2 cells exposed for 4 h to terbuthylazine at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current reference values set by the European Commission in 2011. Terbuthylazine cytotoxicity was evaluated using dual fluorescent staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange on lymphocytes, and CCK-8 colorimetric assay on HepG2 cells. The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified comet assays. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of oxidative stress in vitro was studied using a battery of standard oxidative stress biomarkers. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino mice exposed to terbuthlyazine in the form of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days. Following exposure, the DNA damage levels in leukocytes, bone marrow, liver, and kidney cells of the treated mice were measured using an alkaline comet assay. In vitro results suggested low terbuthylazine cytotoxicity in non-target cells. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced lymphocyte viability by 15%, mostly due to apoptosis, while cytotoxic effects in HepG2 cells at the same concentration were negligible. Acute in vitro exposure of human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells to terbuthylazine resulted in low-level DNA instability, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the DNA damage obtained using the hOGG1-modified comet assay indicated that oxidative DNA damage did not prevail in the overall damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of oxidative stress markers, which were mostly comparable to control. Results obtained in mice indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of terbuthylazine produced DNA instability in all of the studied cell types. We found that DNA in liver and kidney cells was more prone to direct toxic effects of the parent compound and its metabolites than DNA in leukocytes and bone marrow cells. The overall findings suggest the formation of reactive terbuthylazine metabolites capable of inducing DNA cross-links, which hinder DNA migration. These effects were most pronounced in liver cells in vivo and HepG2 cells in vitro. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional research is needed. Nevertheless, the present study provides evidence that terbuthylazine at concentrations comparable with current reference values possesses toxicological risk because it caused low-level DNA instability, both at cellular and animal organism level, which should be further established in forthcoming studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The objectives were to determine the best tillage practice (conventional vs conservation tillage) in terms of grain yields and potential environmental risk, to assess insecticidal exposure using concentrations measured in soil and runoff water and sediments, to compare measured insecticidal concentrations with predicted concentrations from selected risk assessment exposure models, and to calculate toxicity benchmarks from laboratory bioassays performed on reference aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms, using individual active ingredients and the formulation. Corn grain yields were not significantly different based on tillage treatment. Similarly, field concentrations of insecticides were not significantly (p>0.05) different in strip tillage versus conventional tillage, suggesting that neither of the tillage systems would enable greater environmental risk from the insecticidal formulation. Risk quotients were calculated from field concentrations and toxicity data to determine potential risk to nontarget species. The insecticidal formulation used at the recommended rate resulted in soil, sediment, and water concentrations that were potentially harmful to aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, if exposure occurred, with risk quotients up to 34. © 2014 SETAC."

It has shown strong biological activity against Spodoptera litura, but the mechanism of toxicity remains unclear. The present study showed that azadirachtin inhibited the growth of S. litura larvae, which was resulted by structure destroy and size inhibition of the midgut. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of midgut suggested that azadirachtin regulated the transcriptional level of multiple unigenes involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium apoptotic signaling pathways. Simultaneously, the expression patterns of some differentially expressed unigenes were verified by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, the enhanced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, the increased expression of caspase family members and apoptosis-binding motif 1 (IBM1) on both gene and protein level and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm were induced in midgut after azadirachtin treatment. These results demonstrated that azadirachtin induced structural alteration in S. litura larval midgut by apoptosis activation. These alterations may affect the digestion and absorption of nutrients and eventually lead to the growth inhibition of larvae. © 2018 Shu, Zhang, Cui, Sun, Yi and Zhong."

By contextualizing a product's ecotoxicological impact with details regarding its application, we can provide a more complete characterization of the product's environmental risk than is possible with ecotoxicological data alone. We conducted an ecotoxicology experiment to examine the interaction between predator-induced stress and one of three common mosquito insecticide formulations (Mosquito Dunks, Mosquito Bits, and Mosquito Torpedoes) on the performance of Gray Treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles and changes in aquatic communities in pond mesocosms. Then, to describe the extent to which each product was applied in the region surrounding our study area, we conducted a survey of mosquito insecticide practices by individuals who owned or managed property within U.S. Environmental Protection Agency region seven. When applied in the presence of predators, Mosquito Torpedo use resulted in the lowest tadpole survival rates. Mosquito Dunks also reduced tadpole survival when applied in the context of predators (P = 0.06), and Mosquito Bits had no effect on tadpole survival. Of land managers who applied a mosquito insecticide, 5% used Mosquito Bits, 5% used Mosquito Torpedoes, and 81% used Mosquito Dunks. Despite the fact that Mosquito Torpedoes appear to have more severe negative effects on tadpole survival than do Mosquito Dunks, the widespread use of Mosquito Dunks by individuals in our survey leads us to recommend that future research efforts be directed toward Mosquito Dunks. © 2015 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of glyphosate Roundup Original® in tadpoles of Dendropsophus minutus by comet assay and micronucleus test. Fourteen egg masses were collected in two permanent ponds in Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in Alto Paraíso de Goiás, Brazil. Acute exposure was conducted with 180 tadpoles maintained for 99 d in a storage tank until developmental stages 26-31. During acclimation, tadpoles were distributed among 36 tanks and exposed to the following concentrations of the active ingredient (ai) glyphosate Roundup Original®: 0.28 mg ai/L, 1.0 mg ai/L, 2.0 mg ai/L, 4.0 mg ai/L of, negative control (0 mg ai/L), and positive control (10 mg ai/L mitomycin C). After 96 h of exposure, the tadpoles were euthanized with 5% benzocaine and submitted to comet assay and micronucleus test. In the comet assay, a significant increase in DNA damage was observed in response to the 0.28 mg ai/L concentration for tail length, % DNA in the tail, and Olive tail moment. There was no dose-response effect at other concentrations. For the micronucleus test, we did not find a statistically significant increase in micronuclei in erythrocytes of D. minutus after 96 h of exposure to glyphosate. Therefore, in the present study we found that tadpoles of D. minutus are extremely sensitive to low concentrations of glyphosate, demonstrating the importance of amphibian tadpoles in studies of genotoxicity and mutagenicity. © 2018 Brazilian Society of Herpetology."

Its range of sensitivity to potassium dichromate, the acute toxicity of active ingredient carbofuran and of carbofuran dosed as its commercial form, Furadan® 350 SC were determined. Chronic toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan® 350 SC on P. roseola survival and fecundity were also studied. The sensitivity of P. roseola to K2Cr2O7 ranged from 29.52 to 64.67 mg L−1, averaging 47.10 mg L−1. The 48-h EC50 were 13.36 ± 2.63 mg L−1 for carbofuran and 89.32 ± 6.52 mg L−1 for commercial form. Chronic toxicity tests showed that the survival of this rotifer was not affected by the carbofuran dosed as Furadan® 350 SC at the concentrations tested and that at 1.56 and 3.12 mg L−1 their fecundity was higher than in the absence of this commercial product, characterizing the hormesis phenomenon. The sensitivity profile of several species to carbofuran indicated that P. roseola is more susceptible to this pesticide than the fish Clarias batrachus, the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, although the acute toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan® 350 SC to P. roseola is much lower than that of active ingredient carbofuran. The results also imply that the exacerbated use of pesticides and the constant, accelerated expansion of agricultural activity will make aquatic non-target species even more vulnerable. Furthermore, the relevant role of benthic organisms in aquatic environments justifies the inclusion of P. roseola and other benthic species in toxicity screening for risk assessment, regarding this environmental compartment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

It has been based on the QuEChERS methodology (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Several extraction solutions were tested and the composition that showed the best results consisted of a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetonitrile. A cleanup step using the dispersive phases C18 (octadecyl) and PSA (Primary and Secondary Amine) was necessary due to the high amount of oil present in the matrix. The method was validated and the parameters of validation were satisfactory. The accuracy was assessed by calculating the recovery of spiked blank samples in four concentration levels (0.010; 0.025; 0.050 and 0.100 mg kg-1). The results showed satisfactory recoveries (between 70 and 120%), except for oxamyl and tricyclazol at the 0.010 mg kg-1 level that did not show acceptable parameters for the recovery assays. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed coefficients of variation <20%, except for buprofezin, etione and picolinafen at the 0.100 mg kg-1 level.

The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (~200nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (~250nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (~2200nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20μg a.i. L-1 technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Although pesticide sensitivity comparisons between temperate and tropical freshwater organisms have indeed not revealed consistent differences, risk assessments are currently still based on a relatively small tropical toxicity dataset. In addition, greater levels of runoff and spray drift may be expected in tropical than in temperate agroecosystems, indicating that aquatic life in edge-of-field water bodies is likely to be subjected to higher concentrations of pesticides and their mixtures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxicity of Kraft®36 EC (a.i. abamectin), Score®250 EC (a.i. difenoconazole) and their mixture to the Neotropical cladoceran Macrothrix flabelligera. Laboratory toxicity tests with the individual formulated products indicated EC50–48 h values of 3.1 and 659 μg a.i./L given as nominal test concentrations, respectively. Mixtures of the two pesticides revealed a concentration-dependent deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism at low and synergism at high pesticide mixture concentrations. Laboratory toxicity tests were also conducted with microcosm water that was treated with the individual or mixtures through runoff or direct overspray. Microcosm tanks receiving runoff water from experimental soil plots applied with recommended doses of the individual pesticides did not show toxicity to the test organism. Microcosms that received runoff water containing the pesticide mixture, however, did cause a short-term effect on immobility. The microcosms that were treated by direct overspray of both pesticide formulations showed the most pronounced toxic effects. Study findings suggest a potential risk of these pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations, especially when they are both present. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Doses of 10, 50, 100 and 250mg/kg bw/d Roundup® were administered for two weeks to adult male rats. The 10mg/kg bw/d dose which reduced circulatory corticosterone levels, but did not change food consumption and body weight, was selected for further study. The expression of cholesterol receptor (low density lipoprotein receptor), de novo cholesterol synthesis enzyme (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase), hormone-sensitive lipase, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mRNA and phosphorylated form was decreased. Adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (ACTH), melanocortin-2 receptor, expression was not changed but circulatory ACTH levels and adrenal cortex protein kinase A (PKA) activity were reduced. Surprisingly, exogenous ACTH treatment rescued steroidogenesis in Roundup®-treated animals. Apoptosis was evident at 250mg/kg bw/d, but not at 10mg/kg bw/d dose. These results suggest that Roundup® may be inhibitory to hypothalamic-pituitary axis leading to reduction in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/PKA pathway, StAR phosphorylation and corticosterone synthesis in the adrenal tissue. © 2015 The Authors."

While multiple factors are implicated, there is uncertainty surrounding the contribution of certain groups of pesticides to losses in wild and managed bees. Nanotechnology-based pesticides (NBPs) are formulations based on multiple particle sizes and types. By packaging active ingredients in engineered particles, NBPs offer many benefits and novel functions, but may also exhibit different properties in the environment when compared with older pesticide formulations. These new properties raise questions about the environmental disposition and fate of NBPs and their exposure to pollinators. Pollinators such as honey bees have evolved structural adaptations to collect pollen, but also inadvertently gather other types of environmental particles which may accumulate in hive materials. Knowledge of the interaction between pollinators, NBPs, and other types of particles is needed to better understand their exposure to pesticides, and essential for characterizing risk from diverse environmental contaminants. The present review discusses the properties, benefits and types of nanotechnology-based pesticides, the propensity of bees to collect such particles and potential impacts on bee pollinators. © 2019 by the authors."

Altered transcription levels of liver vitellogenin (vtg) have been documented in wild populations of 2 Great Barrier Reef fisheries species and were strongly associated with pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations. The present study examined endocrine and physiological biomarkers in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of commercial herbicide (ATRADEX® WG Herbicide, DIUREX® WG Herbicide) and surfactant (ACTIVATOR® 90) formulations commonly used on sugarcane in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. Estrogenic biomarkers (namely, liver vtg messenger RNA and plasma 17β-estradiol) increased following exposure to commercial mixtures but not to the analytical grade chemical, suggesting an estrogenic response to the additives. In contrast, brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) transcription levels, plasma testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone concentrations, and gill ventilation rates were not affected by any of the experimental exposures. These findings support the assertion that exposure to pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations is a potential causative agent of altered liver vtg transcription levels in wild barramundi. Whether exposure patterns in the Great Barrier Reef catchment and lagoon are sufficient to impair fish sexual and reproductive development and ultimately influence fish population dynamics remains to be determined. These findings highlight the need to consider both active and so-called inert ingredients in commercial pesticide formulations for environmental risk assessments. © 2015 SETAC."

Studies dealing with effects of pesticide exposure on reptiles are limited, mainly addressing the orders Testudines and Crocodylia, but largely neglecting the most diverse reptile order Squamata (lizards and snakes). As a consequence, information regarding effects on their organisms, as well as exposure probability and pesticide uptake in the Reptilia has to be considered rather uncharted. We here ask how pesticide applications affect a widely distributed, synanthropic squamate species in Europe. We studied the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) with regard to enzymatic biomarkers of pesticide exposure (Glutathione-S-Transferase, Glutathione Reductase, Acetylcholinesterase) and body condition. Lizards were sampled from wild populations, along an exposure gradient (three exposed sites with differing land use intensity and one reference site). Our results suggest both dermal and oral uptake of pesticide formulations, with the former being especially relevant during the first two days after a pesticide application. Enzymatic activity slightly differed between exposure gradients, while showing overall similar patterns. Body condition of lizards decreased with increasing pesticide exposure. Furthermore, gender distribution was particularly skewed in favor to males within exposed sample sites. Although reptiles are not target organisms of pesticide applications, many species do come into contact with them, and most probably suffer from dermal and oral uptake. Thus, we believe it is indispensable for reptiles to be integrated in risk assessments in order to improve conservation practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
Durant J.L.,Ignorance loops: How non-knowledge about bee-toxic agrochemicals is iteratively produced,2020,Social Studies of Science,50,751,777,10.1177/0306312720923390,"In this article, I examine the knowledge politics around pesticides in the United States and the role it plays in honey bee declines. Since 2006, US beekeepers have lost an average of one-third of their colonies each year. Though a number of factors influence bee health, beekeepers, researchers and policymakers cite pesticides as a primary contributor. In the US, pesticide registration is overseen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the required tests conducted by chemical companies applying for registration. Until 2016, the EPA only required chemical companies to measure acute toxicity for non-target species, which means that many pesticides with sublethal toxicities are not labeled bee-toxic, and farmers can apply them without penalty while bees are on their farms or orchards. In addition, California state and county regulators will typically only investigate a bee kill caused by a labeled bee-toxic pesticide, and so emergent data on non-labeled, sublethal pesticides goes uncollected. These gaps in data collection frustrate beekeepers and disincentivize them from reporting colony losses to regulatory agencies – thus reinforcing ignorance about which chemicals are toxic to bees. I term the iterative cycle of non-knowledge co-constituted by regulatory shortfalls and stakeholder regulatory disengagement an ‘ignorance loop’. I conclude with a discussion of what this dynamic can tell us about the politics of knowledge production and pesticide governance and the consequences of ‘ignorance loops’ for stakeholders and the environment. © The Author(s) 2020."

We performed a comet assay on the erythrocytes of tadpoles found in the surroundings of agricultural fields (soybean and corn crops), where there is an intense release of several kinds of pesticides in different quantities. We aimed to detect differences in the genotoxic parameters between populations collected from soybeans and cornfields, and between them and tadpoles sampled from non-agricultural areas (control group). Tadpoles collected from ponds located at soybean fields had significantly more DNA damage, followed by tadpoles collected from cornfields. In contrast, animals sampled from non-agricultural areas had the lowest incidence of DNA damage. In addition, we found a negative correlation between the parameters of the comet assay and the area of the ponds surrounding soybean. This correlation indicates a possible dilution effect in the concentration of pesticides. Finally, Physalaemus cuvieri Fitzinger, 1826 seems to be a good bioindicator for detecting the genotoxic effects of field agricultural insecticides; therefore, we suggest that this species should be used in environmental biomonitoring studies, since it is common and abundant where it occurs. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

Mingo V.; Lötters S.; Wagner N.,The use of buccal swabs as a minimal-invasive method for detecting effects of pesticide exposure on enzymatic activity in common wall lizards,2017,Environmental Pollution,220,53,62,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.022,"Habitat loss and environmental pollution are among the main causes responsible for worldwide biodiversity loss. The resulting species and population declines affect all vertebrates including reptiles. Especially in industrialized countries, pollution by agrochemicals is of remarkable importance. Here, habitat loss has historically been associated with expansion of agriculture. Species persisting in such environments do not only need to cope with habitat loss, but more recently, also with chemical intensification, namely pesticide exposure. In this study, we examined effects of different fungicide and herbicide applications on the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in grape-growing areas. We used three enzymatic biomarkers (GST, GR, AChE) and for the first time saliva from buccal swabs as a minimal-invasive sampling method for detection. Our results demonstrate absorption of substances by lizards and effects of pesticide exposure on enzymatic activities. Our findings are in accordance with those of previous laboratory studies, although samples were retrieved from natural habitats. We conclude that buccal swabs could become a useful tool for the detection of pesticide exposure in reptiles and have the potential to replace more invasive methods, such as organ extraction or cardiac puncture. This is an important finding, as reptiles are non-target organisms of pesticide applications, and there is a strong need to integrate them into pesticide risk assessments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

To prepare the solvent, dichloroacetic acid, l-menthol, and n-butanol are mixed at a molar ratio of 4:1:1 and the deep eutectic solvent is formed after heating. Then a dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction method using the prepared solvent is used for the extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides from an aqueous sample. To carry out the procedure, the deep eutectic solvent is mixed with methanol and rapidly injected by a syringe into the aqueous sample containing the analytes. After centrifuging, an aliquot of the sedimented phase is injected into the gas chromatograph. The influence of several variables on the extraction efficiency was investigated and optimized. RESULTS: Extraction recoveries and enrichment factors were obtained in the ranges of 53–86% and 1760–2853, respectively. The intra- (n = 6) and inter-day (n = 5) precision of the method was satisfactory, with relative standard deviations ≤ 7% obtained at two concentrations of 10 and 50 μg L−1 of each analyte. Moreover, detection and quantification limits for the target analytes were obtained in the ranges of 0.11–0.23 and 0.38–0.74 μg L−1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Different samples, including green tea, rose water, lemon balm, mint, and pussy willow distillates were analyzed successfully using the method that was developed, and chlorpyrifos was found in rose water at a concentration of 17 ± 1 μg L−1 (n = 3). © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry"
Müller C.,Impacts of sublethal insecticide exposure on insects — Facts and knowledge gaps,2018,Basic and Applied Ecology,30,1,10,10.1016/j.baae.2018.05.001,"The biodiversity and biomass of insects is dramatically declining due to various anthropogenic factors. One of these factors is the use of insecticides to protect plants from pests. However, apart from the targeted pest insects, thousands of non-target organisms face traces of insecticides that are not lethal but can affect numerous traits of the individual, including development, physiology, behaviour and communication. In the present review, key facts on impacts of sublethal insecticide exposure on such traits are summarised. Attributable to various abiotic and biotic processes, insecticide concentrations may become sublethal in space and time. Nevertheless, these concentrations impede insect development, reducing growth and survival, but sometimes also enhance reproductive performance. The effects are species-specific, but sensitivity also differs within species depending on the developmental stage, sex and population. Furthermore, insecticide exposure influences several immunity pathways and causes changes in behaviour. Such changes are mostly studied on the level of behavioural traits. However, also effects on the consistency of overall individual behavioural phenotypes, i.e. personalities, should be investigated, which have consequences on individual fitness and on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents. Moreover, insecticides can act as info-disruptors, impeding signal production and perception during chemical communication at various levels. Finally, microbial symbionts may modify insect responses to insecticides, being of particular interest for biotechnological approaches. Here, methodological issues are discussed and knowledge gaps and potential future research directions are highlighted. Understanding the mechanisms of dose-dependent insecticide impacts on organisms and their cascading effects on higher levels of biological organisation and on subsequent generations are of utmost importance for proper insecticide use. © 2018 Gesellschaft für Ökologie"

Firstly, we aimed to compare genetic damages in the agricultural workers of two different types of environmental conditions including the greenhouse and open fields. Secondly, we aimed to compare genetic damages in the total agricultural workers as the exposed group (greenhouse and open field workers) (n = 114) and the non-exposed control group (n = 98) living in the same area in Canakkale, Turkey. For these purposes, we investigated the incidence of micronucleus (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), and nuclear buds (NBUDs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We observed that the frequencies of MN, NPB, and NBUD obtained for the greenhouse workers were statistically significantly higher than those obtained for the open field workers. When the results of the control group were compared with those of the total workers, there were statistically significant differences in terms of MN and NBUD frequencies. We found that age and MN were correlated at a significant level in both the agricultural workers and the control group. The MN frequency of the female workers was 1.5 times greater than that of the male workers, and it was a significant level in the agricultural workers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Protecting health and promoting risk reduction, particularly in developing countries, requires access to current findings in a format that can inform policy, regulations, behaviour change and risk reduction. Successfully communicating research findings may require multiple strategies depending on the target audience's varying comprehension skills (e.g., numeracy literacy, visual literacy) and ability to interpret scientific data. To illustrate the complexities of risk communication, a case study of exposure to neurotoxic street pesticides amongst poor, urban South African communities attempting to control poverty related pests, is presented. What remains a challenge is how to communicate neurotoxicity research findings consistently and in a meaningful manner for a lay audience, consisting of both the general public and decision makers. A further challenge is to identify who will monitor and evaluate the ways in which these findings are communicated to ensure quality is maintained. Ultimately, researchers should carry the responsibility of knowledge translation and engaging with communication specialists when appropriate. Additionally, institutions should reward this as part of promotion and academic accolade systems, and funders should fund the translational process. Ethics review boards should also play an instrumental role in ensuring that knowledge translation is part of the ethics review requirement, while professional societies should take more responsibility for disseminating research findings to non-academics. © 2014 The Author."

The toxicity of formulations is currently assessed substance by substance, neglecting possible combined effects in mixtures and many of the findings regarding the toxic effects of glyphosate and GBHs to human cells are inconsistent. This is the first study to investigate and compare the cyto- and genotoxic potential of the active ingredient glyphosate and GBHs in human mononuclear white blood (HMWB) cells. HMWB cells were treated for 4 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations (1–1000 μM) of glyphosate alone and in three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) to test cytotoxic effect with fluorescent colabelling and genotoxic effect with comet assay. In addition, each concentration was tested with and without metabolic activation using human liver S9 fraction. We found that glyphosate alone does not induce significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity over the tested concentration range. Contrarily, GBHs induced statistically significant cell death from 250 μM (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 500 μM (Fozat 480), as well as statistically significant increase of DNA damage from 500 μM (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 750 μM (Fozat 480); however, the latter observation may not be explained by direct DNA injuries, rather due to the high level of cell death (>70%) exerted by the formulations. Metabolic activation significantly increased the DNA damage levels induced by Glyfos, but not of the other GBHs and of glyphosate. The differences observed in the toxic pattern of formulations and the active principle may be attributed to the higher cytotoxic activity of other ingredients in the formulations or to the interaction of them with the active ingredient glyphosate. Hence, further investigation of formulations is crucial for assessing the true health risks of occupational and environmental exposures. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

Alternative management practices such as conservation agriculture could be expected to ensure sustainability of ecosystem services from Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. Conservation agriculture is characterized by minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and diversification of crop species. We analyzed the impacts of several forms of alternative agricultural management practices (conservation tillage, cover cropping, mulching, manual weed management, organic fertilizer use, no-irrigation system) on multiple ecosystem services based on 155 published case studies (1994–2015). The effect size of various management options on four provisioning and four regulating ecosystem services were quantified. Impacts of conservation management options are not uniform. All regulating services were positively affected by the conservation management options except for the system without irrigation. In contrast, the provisioning services were inconsistently influenced by the conservation management options. For crop yield, environmentally sustainable soil management was beneficial, but organic fertilization (effect size = − 0.17), manual weed management (effect size = − 0.35), and no-irrigation system (effect size = − 0.5) led to lower crop yields. The impact on crop biomass was mainly negative but not significant. Water availability was especially important to enhance both provisioning and regulating services. Overall, alternative agriculture management practices led to more positive than negative effects on ecosystem services in the study region. Stimulating the application of conservation management practices is therefore an important policy option for decision-makers given the vulnerability of ecosystem services in the Mediterranean basin. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-à-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro®, Roundup klasik Pro® in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit®, Roundup klasik Pro® in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital®, and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro® did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; Glyphosate herbicide formulation in a tank mix with surfactants and also surfactants alone significantly influenced the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as the glyphosate formulation alone had no effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

While multiple studies have documented the toxicity, environmental persistence, and tendency to spread for glyphosate and Roundup®, few studies have compared the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations to the toxicity of pure glyphosate for soil invertebrates, which contact both the herbicide and the formulations. Hundreds of formulations exist; their inert ingredients are confidential; and glyphosate persists in our food, water, and soil. In this experiment, we held glyphosate type and concentration constant, varying only formulation. Using Roundup Ready-to-Use III®, Roundup Super Concentrate®, and pure glyphosate, we delivered 26.3 mg glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt per kg of soil to compost worms (Eisenia fetida). We found that worms living in soil spiked with pure glyphosate lost 14.8–25.9% of their biomass and survived a stress test for 22.2–33.3% less time than worms living in uncontaminated soil. Worms living in soil spiked with Roundup Ready-to-Use III® and Roundup Super Concentrate® did not lose body mass and survived the stress test as well as worms living in uncontaminated soil. No contaminant affected soil microbial or fungal biomass over the 40-day period of this experiment. We suggest that the nitrates and phosphates in the formulations offset the toxic effects of glyphosate by spurring microbial growth and speeding glyphosate degradation. We also found a 26.5–41.3% reduction in fungal biomass across all treatments over the course of this experiment, suggesting that the worms consumed fungi and spores. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the food–energy–water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally. 2019 The Authors.

However, standard sampling procedures are invasive, requiring tissue, organ or blood extraction. This leads to concerns regarding conservation practice, animal welfare and restrictions in study design. New techniques are needed to avoid these problems, but still generate reliable data. Here, we aimed at validating the use of buccal swabs as a reliable method to detect pesticide exposure in reptiles. Common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis)were divided into control, dermal and oral treatment groups and exposed to different pesticide formulations. Subsequently, buccal swabs were taken and enzymatic activity was analyzed. We were able to confirm the suitability of the method to detect effects of pesticide exposure on the enzymatic level. While exposure to the formulation Roundup Ultramax® didn't match when compared to effects previously observed in situ when compared to other glyphosate based formulations, effects could still be detected. This can be seen as a strong indicator that the active ingredient of a formulation may not always be the mian driver for ecotoxicological effectsat the enzymatic level. At the same time, exposure towards the single formulation Vivando® didn't result in any effects. However, individuals residing in agricultural landscapes will mostly be exposed to pesticide mixes containing different formulations. Our results strongly advocate that buccal swabbing is a reliable minimal invasive method to generate samples for detecting effects of pesticide exposure in reptiles. Due to its easy handling, we believe it will provide new opportunities concerning study designs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Identifying novel active ingredients and improving the delivery system of a pesticide are the main challenges in developing new pesticides. Strategies for the control of delivery systems for slow and sustained release of agrochemicals are of great interest to environmental scientists. In this context, the selection of materials to be used as carrier agents in pesticide formulations is crucial. In recent years, the efficacy of several materials for agrochemical formulations has been evaluated by researchers. These materials have unique properties, such as being biodegradable and biocompatible, and having low toxicity and involving a simple preparation process. This review summarises recent applications of various materials in pesticide formulations. The application of the materials can effectively encapsulate or bind the pesticide’s active ingredients in the material’s matrix with a sustained release profile and slow mobility in soil. This review also discusses some issues and concerns that are faced in formulating pesticide products. © 2016, Islamic Azad University (IAU)."

Glyphosate is a nonselective systemic herbicide, which is commonly used for drying CC. Here we included a review of the related topics and showed the effects of drying oats and rye with glyphosate, inoculation with two plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, and nitrogen fertilization on rhizosphere microbial communities at field conditions in the western Pampas of Argentina. Rhizosphere samples were obtained at three times: Before drying the CC, a month after this, and at harvest time of soybean which was grown after each CC. Counts of viable cells and physiology of rhizosphere microbial communities were analyzed. The inclusion of CC dried with glyphosate modifies their associated rhizosphere microbial communities. Their numbers significantly decreased or increased. For some microorganisms, these changes were temporary because their amounts at soybean harvest time did not differ from those obtained when the sampling was done before drying CC with glyphosate application. Besides, our results indicate that the drying time must be chosen taking into account CC types and their phenology. This scientific information is evidence of changes on rhizosphere microbial communities due to the management of CC with glypho- sate in combination with or without both inoculation and fertilization of CC. These data are agronomic and environmentally relevant because they have shown that the type of management would impact on the quality and health of the soil and therefore in agroecosystem sustainability. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The long-term effects of 5 applications over 30 d of binary mixtures of the herbicides diuron and hexazinone were assessed at “low” and “high” concentrations typically found in the environment, using mesocosms. Sixteen of 95 phytoplankton taxa, 3 of 18 zooplankton taxa, and 6 of 14 macroinvertebrate taxa responded negatively to contaminant exposures. Herbicide applications altered the phytoplankton community structure. Relative abundance of Cyanophyceae decreased following 5 applications from 52.1% in the control to 37.3% in the low treatment and to 25.9% in the high treatment, while Chlorophyceae increased to 50.6% in the low treatment and to 61.7% in the high treatment compared with the control (39.7%). Chlorophyceae had the greatest number of affected species (8), whereas 1 species within the Cyanophyceae was negatively affected on more than 1 sampling day. Further, chlorophyll a was reduced on 4 and 5 d out of the 8 total sampling days in the low and high treatments, respectively, compared with the control. These results highlight that integrating multiple taxa and contaminants with long-term exposures in ecological risk assessments of herbicides can facilitate the ability to make predictive and mechanistic generalizations about the role of herbicides in shaping patterns of species abundance in natural systems.

Mesnage R.; Benbrook C.; Antoniou M.N.,Insight into the confusion over surfactant co-formulants in glyphosate-based herbicides,2019,Food and Chemical Toxicology,128,137,145,10.1016/j.fct.2019.03.053,"Glyphosate is the active ingredient in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEAs were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are ∼100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted. Research to understand health implications from ingesting these substances is required. © 2019 The Authors"

Nevertheless, only the active substances are evaluated with a comprehensive battery of mammalian toxicity tests. However, in some cases mixture effects of active substances and adjuvants may occur, leading to increased toxicity of the products. To address this issue, we investigated effects of active substances with known hepatotoxicity and two commonly used fungicides: Priori Xtra® and Adexar®. For this purpose, respective active substances individually and in combination as well as the products were applied to two human hepatoma cell lines (HepaRG and HepG2) in a broad dose range. The results of cytotoxicity analysis, nuclear receptor transactivation (AhR, CAR, PXR), mRNA and protein expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) allow the conclusion that active substances and plant protection products differ in terms of their in vitro toxicity. The products activate AhR, while the individual active substances as well as the combination of the active substances have no or only minor effects. The present results support the hypothesis that plant protection products may have a modified toxicity as compared to active substances alone, consequently requiring more comprehensive testing. © 2018 The Authors"

To test this hypothesis, the hepatic transcriptomes in Barramundi, a perciforme teleost fish, (Lates calcarifer) from two reference sites, two agriculturally impacted sites sampled during the dry season, and an impacted site sampled during the wet season were compared. The hepatic transcriptome was profiled using RNA-Seq. Multivariate analysis showed that transcriptomes were clustered based on site and by inference water quality, but not sampling time. The largest differences in transcriptomic profile were between reference sites and a site sampled during high run-off, showing that impacted sites can be identified via RNA-Seq. Transcripts with altered abundance were linked to xenobiotic metabolism, peroxisome proliferation and stress responses, indicating putative stressors with the potential for adverse outcomes in barramundi. © 2017"

A narrative literature review was conducted to explore the mechanism/s of interactions between greenhouse characteristics and occupational pesticide exposure. Using a “work”, “worker” and “workplace” conceptual framework, the greenhouse environment (hot and humid microclimate, limited space and dense crop arrangements) combines with work characteristics (high work and pesticide use intensity, multi-tasking, predominantly manual spraying techniques and quick reentry to treated farms) to potentially increase occupational pesticide exposure, compared with open field farming. Greenhouse environments, are variable but have been shown to influence pesticide availability, route, pathways and frequency of exposure, deposition and distribution on a worker’s body as well as use and performance of exposure control methods. Training programs can emphasize the differences in exposure potential between greenhouse and open field farming. Development of tailored guidelines for exposure control strategies to better suit the level of uniqueness of greenhouse agriculture seems warranted. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This poisoning is a highly fatal condition that requires a rapid and precise diagnosis for adequate treatment. However, various studies on mortality predictor factors have been insufficient for whole pesticide treatments. We hypothesized that the initial plasma anion gap (AG) and base deficit (BD) are reliable prognostic factors. Methods: A retrospective study analyzed 561 patients with a diagnosis of acute pesticide poisoning between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017. The initial AG and BD values were divided into quartiles according to the number of patients. Survival at 30 days from admission was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn, and the areas under the curve for AG and BD for mortality were calculated. Results: Fifty-eight (10.3%) of 561 patients died within 30 days. The highest AG quartile (>22 mEq/L) was associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital mortality. Compared to patients with an AG less than 14.7 mEq/L, these patients had a 4.18-fold higher risk of 30-day hospital mortality and the highest BD quartile (>7.9 mEq/L) was associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital mortality. Compared to patients with a BD less than 1.4 mEq/L, these patients had 2.23-fold higher risk of 30-day hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC for AG and BD curve were 0.699 and 0.744, respectively. Conclusions: Initial high AG and BD values could predict mortality and require precise intensive care. © The Author(s) 2018."

We particularly highlight transformation pathways that may enhance biological activity and/or persistence; for example, limited studies suggest dichloroacetamides can transform via dechlorination into products with increased bioactivity. We also identify several research needs to improve our understanding of the environmental fate and potential risks of this overlooked agrochemical class, which in turn will enhance the efficacy and safety of future herbicide safener formulations. © 2015 American Chemical Society."

In this study, the genotoxic potential of a commercial formulation of permethrin and allethrin was examined using cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Genotoxicity was evaluated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN cyt) assay by measuring the frequency of micronuclei (MN), nuclear division index (NDI), formation of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) and nuclear buds (NBUD), as well as apoptotic and necrotic cells. Human PBL were treated with different concentrations of a permethrin/allethrin mixture (1/0.01, 5/0.07, and 10/0.14 μg/ml) for 24 or 36 h. The highest concentration (10/0.14 μg/ml) of permethrin/allethrin mixture significantly increased MN frequency and percent apoptotic cells after incubations for 24 or 36 h. The NDI was markedly decreased in response to treatment with 5/0.07 or 10/0.14 μg/ml permethrin/allethrin for both 24 and 36 h. Exposure to the permethrin/allethrin mixture did not significantly alter formation of NBUD, NPB, or percent necrotic cells. The MN frequency was significantly correlated with the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells but inversely correlated with NDI. Data demonstrated that a mixture of permethrin and allethrin induced concentration-and time-dependent cytotoxic and genotoxic damage to human PBL in vitro.

The review is about correlating the indiscriminate use of pesticides and to find out and highlight the evidences for mechanism of action of these pesticides for erectile dysfunction and find out the most used and most dangerous pesticide from erectile dysfunction point of view. The review suggests that erectile dysfunction is having a significant place as a causal factor for infertility. Study infers that pesticides are having multiple mechanisms of action through which these cause erectile dysfunction.

Dosages of neonicotinoids applied in seed coating materials were determined and are compared to other applications (spray and granule). Environmental levels in soils and affecting factors in translocation are discussed. Excretion of neonicotinoids via guttation from coated maize seeds up to two months upon emergence, as well as cross-contamination of plants emerged from non-coated seeds or weeds nearby have been demonstrated. Contamination of surface waters is discussed in scope of a worldwide review and the environmental fate of the neonicotinoid active ingredients and the formulating surfactant appeared to be mutually affected by each other. Toxicity of neonicotinoid active ingredients and formulations on Daphnia magna completed with some investigations of activity of the detoxifying glutathione S-transferase enzyme demonstrated the modified toxicity due to the formulating agents. Electrophysiological results on identified central neurons of the terrestrial snail Helix pomatia showed acetylcholine antagonist (inhibitory) effects of neonicotinoid insecticide products, but no agonist (ACh-like) effects were recorded. These data also suggested different molecular targets (nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors and acetylcholine esterase enzyme) of neonicotinoids in the snail central nervous system. © 2020 by the authors.

Defarge N.; Spiroux de Vendômois J.; Séralini G.E.,Toxicity of formulants and heavy metals in glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides,2018,Toxicology Reports,5,156,163,10.1016/j.toxrep.2017.12.025,"The major pesticides of the world are glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), and their toxicity is highly debated. To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36–48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10–20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants. Considering these new data, this assessment method appears insufficient to ensure safety. These results, taken together, shed a new light on the toxicity of these major herbicides and of pesticides in general. © 2017 The Authors"
Lugowska K.,The effects of Roundup on gametes and early development of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L),2018,Fish Physiology and Biochemistry,44,1109,1117,10.1007/s10695-018-0498-9,"To determine the effects of Roundup, a commercial formulation of glyphosate, gametes, and embryos of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L) was exposed to wide range of herbicide concentrations (0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, and 50.0 mg/l). The obtained results showed different effects of Roundup on common carp gametes. Herbicide reduced swelling of eggs (but the effect was not concentration-related), while sperm showed low sensitivity to Roundup (time of spermatozoa motility was reduced in a significant way only at 20 mg/l, and at remaining concentrations, only a slight tendency was observed). During the embryonic development, Roundup caused a decrease of common carp embryonic survival (and the effect was concentration-related); however, it had no effect on development rate. During the embryogenesis, three types of embryo body malformation were observed: yolk sac edema, spine curvature, and shortening of body, but their frequencies were not associated with the presence or concentration of herbicide. However, Roundup affected quality of newly hatched larvae of common carp by increasing their mortality. No effect of herbicide on percentage of deformed larvae was observed but larvae hatched in water with Roundup tended to show more complex anomalies compared to those from the control. Obtained data showed that even low concentrations of this herbicide in waters can significantly reduce egg swelling, survival of embryos, and quality of fish larvae. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature."

Pesticides applied more often had higher numbers of associated illness episodes reported.

Framing the problem of glyphosate resistant weeds and genetically engineered crops,2017,Journal of Rural Studies,51,211,221,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.03.003,"In this paper, we explore how efforts to frame the socio-environmental problem of glyphosate resistant weeds— superweeds—at particular scales shape calls for certain governance strategies and regulatory responses. We use a political agronomy approach and the politics of scale literature to understand the linkages and relationships between socio-political and economic forces and the problem of glyphosate resistant weeds. We draw on in-depth interview data with representatives from farm groups, consumer and environmental advocacy organizations, agriculture and biotech companies, government regulatory agencies, and agricultural extension agents, together with a content analysis of websites of GE supporters and opponents. Together these data are used to explore how the problem of superweeds is being framed by proponents and opponents of GE crops, and among agricultural scientists, advocacy organizations and business. We conclude that when environmental problems associated with pesticide resistance are ‘scaled up’ to incorporate more systemic agricultural issues and are linked with broader socio-economic and political issues that impact a larger public, there are greater possibilities for pushing for government intervention and regulation to address environmental burdens and externalities. © 2017"

However, the toxicity and interactions achieved when applied as a mixture have not yet been characterised. The equitoxic and non-equitoxic acute toxicity exerted by binary mixtures of Banvel® (57.71% DIC) and DMA® (58.4% 2,4-D) on the Neotropical fish Cnesterodon decemmaculatus were evaluated. Results revealed mean values of 1.02 (range, 0.96–1.08) for the toxic unit (TU) that induced 50% mortality (TU50 96 h) to the fish exposed to binary equitoxic mixtures of the commercial formulations Banvel®–DMA®. These results suggest that the mixture is nearly concentration additive. Furthermore, results demonstrated the occurrence of synergistic interaction when non-equitoxic combinations of Banvel®-or DMA®-formulated herbicides were assayed. In this context and regardless of their concentrations, either Banvel®- or DMA®-induced toxicity were synergised by the presence of the counterpart within mixtures. The present study represents the first evidence of the lethality exerted by mixtures of two auxinic herbicides—namely, DIC and 2,4-D—reported to date for fish and other biotic matrices. When C. decemmaculatus is used as the target organism, a synergistic pattern is observed following exposure to a mixture of both herbicides.

It is a broad spectrum herbicide and its agricultural uses increased considerably after the development of glyphosate-resistant genetically modified (GM) varieties. Since glyphosate was introduced in 1974, all regulatory assessments have established that glyphosate has low hazard potential to mammals, however, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded in March 2015 that it is probably carcinogenic. The IARC conclusion was not confirmed by the EU assessment or the recent joint WHO/FAO evaluation, both using additional evidence. Glyphosate is not the first topic of disagreement between IARC and regulatory evaluations, but has received greater attention. This review presents the scientific basis of the glyphosate health assessment conducted within the European Union (EU) renewal process, and explains the differences in the carcinogenicity assessment with IARC. Use of different data sets, particularly on long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity in rodents, could partially explain the divergent views; but methodological differences in the evaluation of the available evidence have been identified. The EU assessment did not identify a carcinogenicity hazard, revised the toxicological profile proposing new toxicological reference values, and conducted a risk assessment for some representatives uses. Two complementary exposure assessments, human-biomonitoring and food-residues-monitoring, suggests that actual exposure levels are below these reference values and do not represent a public concern. © 2017, The Author(s)."

The species Lantana montevidensis (Spreng.) Briq. (Verbenaceae), chumbinho, is a subshrub rich in secondary metabolites it uses for its own defence. The experimental model for Drosophila melanogaster has been used in several types of studies. Some of its advantages are its easy management and its fast rate of reproduction. Objective: Evaluate the chemical composition and insecticidal effect of the essential oil (EO) of L. montevidensis against D. melanogaster. Method: EO of dry leaves from Crato-CE, Brazil, was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/EMS to identify its constituents. As part of the test, evaluation was conducted or the mortality and negative geotaxis of the flies, to attain which they were exposed to different concentrations of the EO (3-30.5 µg/mL essential oil/air). A total 20 adult flies were subjected to cold diapause and placed in 300 mL bottles with filter paper in their lower section impregnated with 1 mL of 20 % saccharose in distilled water. Filter paper was also attached to the upper section (lid) to apply the test product OELM. Readings were taken every 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Results: Results showed that the principal components of the EO are ?caryophyllene (34.96 %), germacrene D (25.49 %) and bicyclogermacrene (9.78 %). In the insecticide test there was a CL50 for the concentration of 15.14 µg/ml in 3 h exposure, and significant damage to the locomotor system of the flies. Conclusion: The study provides evidence that the EO analyzed is a potential biopesticide. © 2017, Editorial Ciencias Medicas. All rights reserved."
van de Merwe J.P.; Neale P.A.; Melvin S.D.; Leusch F.D.L.,In vitro bioassays reveal that additives are significant contributors to the toxicity of commercial household pesticides,2018,Aquatic Toxicology,199,263,268,10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.03.033,"Pesticides commonly used around households can contain additives of unknown concentrations and toxicity. Given the likelihood of these chemicals washing into urban waterways, it is important to understand the effects that these additives may have on aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of commercially available household pesticides to that of the active ingredient(s) alone. The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600× difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations. In addition, monitoring programmes and chemical risk assessments schemes should develop a structured approach to assessing the toxic effects of commercial formulations, including additives, rather than simply those of the listed active ingredients. © 2018"

Residue of the insecticide is frequently detected in trace to moderate concentration in food grains and in surface water of different freshwater ecosystems of the country. In this study, 96 h LC50 of the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus were determined as 90.0 and 42.0 µg/L based on 2 h actual concentration of chlorpyrifos in water. About 96 h exposure to sublethal concentrations (0, 12.0 and 25.0 μg/L) of the commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos reduced the level of hepatic glycogen, activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase in liver and elevated the level of plasma glucose and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in O. niloticus. About 28-day exposure to these sub-lethal concentrations caused anemia in fish, while 90 days exposure reduced growth of the fish and carcass concentration of crude protein and crude lipid as compared to control. It was concluded from this study that commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos (20% EC) was highly toxic to O. niloticus. Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of the insecticide could induce oxidative stress and anemia resulting in reduced growth of the fish. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

This study constitutes a follow-up investigation of a 90-day feeding study conducted by Monsanto in order to obtain commercial release of this GMO, employing the same rat strain and analyzing biochemical parameters on the same number of animals per group as our investigation. Our research represents the first chronic study on these substances, in which all observations including tumors are reported chronologically. Thus, it was not designed as a carcinogenicity study. We report the major findings with 34 organs observed and 56 parameters analyzed at 11 time points for most organs. Results: Biochemical analyses confirmed very significant chronic kidney deficiencies, for all treatments and both sexes; 76% of the altered parameters were kidney-related. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5 to 5.5 times higher. Marked and severe nephropathies were also generally 1.3 to 2.3 times greater. In females, all treatment groups showed a two- to threefold increase in mortality, and deaths were earlier. This difference was also evident in three male groups fed with GM maize. All results were hormone- and sex-dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors more frequently and before controls; the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by consumption of GM maize and Roundup treatments. Males presented up to four times more large palpable tumors starting 600 days earlier than in the control group, in which only one tumor was noted. These results may be explained by not only the non-linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup but also by the overexpression of the EPSPS transgene or other mutational effects in the GM maize and their metabolic consequences. Conclusion: Our findings imply that long-term (2 year) feeding trials need to be conducted to thoroughly evaluate the safety of GM foods and pesticides in their full commercial formulations. © 2014, Séralini et al.; licensee Springer."

Two-cell stage embryos were in vitro cultured with addition of the listed chemicals until blastocyst formation. All active pyrethroids negatively affected embryonic development at 1000 μM concentration. Decreased quality of obtained blastocysts in permethrin, fenvalerate and λ-cyhalothrin-treated embryos was revealed as well. Deltamethrin showed harmful impact on embryo development at 100 μM concentration. Lower concentrations of pyrethroids (1, 10 μM) had no effect on embryo development. The presence of DECIS EW 50 containing deltamethrin at 100 μM caused degeneration of all embryos. Similarly, TOP SPOT ON STRONGER containing 100 μM of permethrin impaired embryonic development and quality of obtained blastocysts. Evaluated secondary ingredients (butylhydroxyanisol, butylhydroxytoluen, butylparaben and cyclohexanone) at corresponding concentrations showed damaging impact on preimplantation embryo development as well. Our results indicate that the embryotoxic potential of active pyrethroids is relatively low, whereas pyrethroid-based products have relatively high potential to impair mouse preimplantation development. Embryotoxicity of commercial products is probably attributable to the presence of secondary ingredients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
Vanlaeys A.; Dubuisson F.; Seralini G.-E.; Travert C.,Formulants of glyphosate-based herbicides have more deleterious impact than glyphosate on TM4 Sertoli cells,2018,Toxicology in Vitro,52,14,22,10.1016/j.tiv.2018.01.002,"Roundup and Glyphogan are glyphosate-based herbicides containing the same concentration of glyphosate and confidential formulants. Formulants are declared as inert diluents but some are more toxic than glyphosate, such as the family of polyethoxylated alkylamines (POEA). We tested glyphosate alone, glyphosate-based herbicide formulations and POEA on the immature mouse Sertoli cell line (TM4), at concentrations ranging from environmental to agricultural-use levels. Our results show that formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides induce TM4 mitochondrial dysfunction (like glyphosate, but to a lesser extent), disruption of cell detoxification systems, lipid droplet accumulation and mortality at sub-agricultural doses. Formulants, especially those present in Glyphogan, are more deleterious than glyphosate and thus should be considered as active principles of these pesticides. Lipid droplet accumulation after acute exposure to POEA suggests the rapid penetration and accumulation of formulants, leading to mortality after 24 h. As Sertoli cells are essential for testicular development and normal onset of spermatogenesis, disturbance of their function by glyphosate-based herbicides could contribute to disruption of reproductive function demonstrated in mammals exposed to these pesticides at a prepubertal stage of development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

With properties in between those of ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO), NF membranes have been used in many interesting applications especially in water and wastewater treatment and desalination. Other applications include those in pharmaceutical and biotechnology, food and non-aqueous types of application. This review will comprehensively look at the recent advances in NF membranes research. Significant development has taken place in terms of the fundamental understanding of the transport mechanism in NF membranes. This has been translated into predictive modeling based on the modified extended Nernst-Planck equation. Similarly various methods have been used to fabricate improved NF membranes especially through interfacial polymerization incorporating nanoparticles and other additives, UV grafting/photografting, electron beam irradiation, plasma treatment and layer-by-layer modification. New applications were also explored in many industries. However fouling is still a prevalent issue that may hinder successful application of NF membranes. Efforts towards NF fouling prevention and mitigation have also been reported.

Strain But2 and Acinetobacter baumannii strain DT,2020,FEMS Microbiology Letters,367,,,10.1093/femsle/fnaa151,"Herbicides have been extensively used globally, resulting in severe environmental pollution. Novel butachlor-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain But2 isolated from soil can degrade butachlor regardless of the concentration and grows without a lag phase. Specific degradation was increased at 0.01-0.1 mM, and did not change significantly at higher concentrations. During degradation, 2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl) acetamide, 2,6-diethylaniline, and 1,3-diethylbenzene were formed, which indicated that deamination occurred. Moreover, Pseudomonas sp. strains could tolerate propanil at up to 0.8 mM. The mixed bacterial culture of Pseudomonas sp. But2 and Acinetobacter baumannii DT (a propanil-degrading bacterial strain) showed highly effective biodegradation of both butachlor and propanil in liquid media and soil. For example, under treatment with the mixed culture, the half-lives of propanil and butachlor were 1 and 5 days, respectively, whereas those for the control were 3 and 15 days. The adjuvants present in herbicides reduced degradation in liquid media, but did not influence herbicide removal from the soil. The results showed that the mixed bacteria culture is a good candidate for the removal of butachlor and propanil from contaminated soils. © The Author(s) 2020.

Scientific data indicate that agricultural intensification and pesticide use are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss. The analysed data and experiences do not support statements that herbicide-resistant crops provide consistently better yields than conventional crops or reduce herbicide amounts. They rather show that the adoption of herbicide-resistant crops impacts agronomy, agricultural practice, and weed management and contributes to biodiversity loss in several ways: (i) many studies show that glyphosate-based herbicides, which were commonly regarded as less harmful, are toxic to a range of aquatic organisms and adversely affect the soil and intestinal microflora and plant disease resistance; the increased use of 2,4-D or dicamba, linked to new herbicide-resistant crops, causes special concerns. (ii) The adoption of herbicide-resistant crops has reduced crop rotation and favoured weed management that is solely based on the use of herbicides. (iii) Continuous herbicide resistance cropping and the intensive use of glyphosate over the last 20 years have led to the appearance of at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species worldwide. Although recommended for many years, farmers did not counter resistance development in weeds by integrated weed management, but continued to rely on herbicides as sole measure. Despite occurrence of widespread resistance in weeds to other herbicides, industry rather develops transgenic crops with additional herbicide resistance genes. (iv) Agricultural management based on broad-spectrum herbicides as in herbicide-resistant crops further decreases diversity and abundance of wild plants and impacts arthropod fauna and other farmland animals. Taken together, adverse impacts of herbicide-resistant crops on biodiversity, when widely adopted, should be expected and are indeed very hard to avoid. For that reason, and in order to comply with international agreements to protect and enhance biodiversity, agriculture needs to focus on practices that are more environmentally friendly, including an overall reduction in pesticide use.

Most commonly they are used as plant protection products and regarded as a synonym for it and so also in this text.) © 2017, The Author(s)."
Mesnage R.; Antoniou M.N.,Ignoring Adjuvant Toxicity Falsifies the Safety Profile of Commercial Pesticides,2018,Frontiers in Public Health,5,,,10.3389/fpubh.2017.00361,"Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and “other ingredients,” with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants.” These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments. © Copyright © 2018 Mesnage and Antoniou."

The toxicity of alachlor to marine life has been rarely studied; therefore, we evaluated the physiological and transcriptional responses in the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. The herbicide led to considerable decreases in P. minimum cell numbers and pigment contents. The EC50 was determined to be 0.373 mg/L. Photosynthesis efficiency and chlorophyll autofluorescence dramatically decreased with increasing alachlor dose and exposure time. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the photosynthesis-related genes PmpsbA, PmatpB, and PmrbcL were induced the most by alachlor; the transcriptional level of each gene varied with time. PmrbcL expression increased after 30 min of alachlor treatment, whereas PmatpB and PmpsbA increased after 24 h. The PmpsbA expression level was highest (5.0 times compared to control) after 6 h of alachlor treatment. There was no significant change in PmpsaA expression with varying treatment time or concentration. Additionally, there was no notable change in the expression of antioxidant genes PmGST and PmKatG, or in ROS accumulation. These suggest that alachlor may affect microalgal photosystem function, with little oxidative stress, causing severe physiological damage to the cells, and even cell death. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The aim of the present study was to analyze whether G and R are able to affect Sertoli cell functions, such as energy metabolism and blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity. Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty acid oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction barrier. However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important function of Sertoli cell such as BTB integrity and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
Werner I.; Moran K.,Effects of pyrethroid insecticides on aquatic organisms,2008,ACS Symposium Series,991,310,334,10.1021/bk-2008-0991.ch014,"Aquatic organisms, in particular insects, crustaceans and fish, are highly sensitive to pyrethroid insecticides. Acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates is generally observed at concentrations below 1 pg/L, and sublethal effects have been reported at low ng/L concentrations. Although it is difficult to model sublethal responses to toxicants and predict ecotoxicological impact or risk, measures of sublethal effects are likely to be as important, or more important, than the measures of acute or chronic lethal effects to accurately assess the consequences of contaminant exposure. The primary mechanism of toxic action is often not the only toxic effect a chemical can exert on target and non-target species. For example, neurotoxic pesticides may impair the immune system or exhibit hormonal effects, or can alter behavior with negative effects on predator avoidance or reproductive success. Many of these chemical side effects are poorly understood or unknown. Although toxic concentrations of pyrethroids in sediments of surface waters have been reported, there is presently limited information on their temporal and spatial distribution, as well as concentrations of pyrethroids in the water column. One of the major limitations for obtaining data on the sources and quantities of pyrethroids in the environment, in particular in water samples, is the sensitivity of the existing analytical chemistry techniques. Because pyrethroids are toxic at extremely low concentrations (low to mid parts per trillion range) monitoring data that are based on insufficiently low detection limits are of little use. In fact, such data can convey a false sense of safety with regard to the potential toxic effects of pyrethroid contamination on aquatic ecosystems, especially if multiple pyrethroids are present simultaneously. Due to their relatively short half-lives and hydrophobic nature, pyrethroid concentrations in larger water bodies are expected to be generally ephemeral, especially in the water column. Higher toxicity and reduced degradation rates at low temperatures may render pyrethroids a greater risk to aquatic life during the winter period, which-along with winter rains and associated stormwater runoff -has the potential to make winter applications of pyrethroids more important environmentally than summer applications. Critical data gaps on pyrethroids exist. To provide much needed information the following questions should be answered in future work: How do sublethal toxic effects affect the ecological fitness of organisms and populations? - Do pyrethroids interact with other stressors or chemical contaminants to induce toxicity? - What are the effects of inert ingredients in pyrethroid formulations on toxicity and environmental fate and transport?. © 2008 American Chemical Society."

Pesticide exports included >500,000 pounds of known or suspected carcinogens, with most going to developing countries; pesticides associated with endocrine disruption were exported at an average rate of >100 tons/day. Although the rate of export of banned products declined, as did exports of pesticides included in global conventions on Prior Informed Consent and Persistent Organic Pollutions, substantial quantities of hazardous products remain in trade. These products pose unacceptable risks in countries where unsafe use and storage practices are prevalent.

Its reproductive toxicity is related to the inhibition of a StAR protein and an aromatase enzyme, which causes an in vitro reduction in testosterone and estradiol synthesis. Studies in vivo about this herbicide effects in prepubertal Wistar rats reproductive development were not performed at this moment. Evaluations included the progression of puberty, body development, the hormonal production of testosterone, estradiol and corticosterone, and the morphology of the testis. Results showed that the herbicide (1) significantly changed the progression of puberty in a dose-dependent manner; (2) reduced the testosterone production, in semineferous tubules' morphology, decreased significantly the epithelium height (P < 0.001; control = 85.8 ± 2.8 μm; 5 mg/kg = 71.9 ± 5.3 μm; 50 mg/kg = 69.1 ± 1.7 μm; 250 mg/kg = 65.2 ± 1.3 μm) and increased the luminal diameter (P < 0.01; control = 94.0 ± 5.7 μm; 5 mg/kg = 116.6 ± 6.6 μm; 50 mg/kg = 114.3 ± 3.1 μm; 250 mg/kg = 130.3 ± 4.8 μm); (4) no difference in tubular diameter was observed; and (5) relative to the controls, no differences in serum corticosterone or estradiol levels were detected, but the concentrations of testosterone serum were lower in all treated groups (P < 0.001; control = 154.5 ± 12.9 ng/dL; 5 mg/kg = 108.6 ± 19.6 ng/dL; 50 mg/dL = 84.5 ± 12.2 ng/dL; 250 mg/kg = 76.9 ± 14.2 ng/dL).

Here we developed a method for analyzing three trisiloxane surfactants (single polyethoxylate (EO) chain and end-capped with methyl, acetyl, or hydroxyl groups; TSS-CH3, TSS-COCH3, or TSS-H) in beehive matrices based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) approach from less than 2 g of honey, pollen, or beeswax. Recoveries for each oligomer (2-13 EO) were between 66 and 112% in all matrices. Average method detection limits (MDL) were 0.53, 0.60, 0.56 ng/g in honey, 0.63, 0.81, 0.78 ng/g in pollen, and 0.51, 0.69, 0.63 ng/g in beeswax. Five honey, 10 pollen, and 10 beeswax samples were analyzed. Trisiloxane surfactants were detected in every beeswax and 60% of the pollen samples. Total trisiloxane surfactant concentrations were up to 390 and 39 ng/g in wax and pollen. The described method is proved suitable for analyzing trisiloxane surfactants in beehive samples. The presence of trisiloxane surfactants in North American beehives calls for renewed effort to investigate the consequence of these adjuvants to bee health and the ongoing global bee decline. © 2013 American Chemical Society."

Samples of STE were examined pre- and post-reverse osmosis (RO) treatment in two plants. Risk quotients (RQ) were estimated by expressing the maximum and median concentration as a function of the health value. Of 128 pesticides analyzed, 11 were detected in STE. Trifluralin was detected in 86.5% of the STE samples followed by metolachlor (67.6%), 2,4-D (50%), and propiconazole (42.5%). Metolachlor was the only pesticide detected post-RO in one sample (0.08 μg/L, limit of reporting = 0.05 μg/L). RQ(max) were all below health values in the STE with the exception of thiophanate methyl (RQ max = 2.4). RO was able to reduce the concentration of all pesticides below LOR. Median removal efficiency for RO ranged from 67.1% (atrazine) to 98.8% (2,4-D). The results indicate that, despite the detection of pesticides in STE, the impact on indirect potable reuse is negligible due to the low concentrations in STE and their subsequent removal during RO treatment. Implementation of risk management strategies to optimize safety and recommendations for a monitoring program are also discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

For liquid formulations, hand exposure was 22-62 times greater than that for solid ones. The dermal exposure mechanism was studied for this formulation under laboratory conditions, finding that the rupture of the aluminum seal of the pesticide container and the color of the liquid formulation are important factors. Additionally, significant external surface contamination of pesticide containers collected at horticultural farms was found. This could partially account for the differences between the exposure levels of field and laboratory experiments for liquid formulations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Such an increase in testing efficiency is necessary to address the lack of toxicity information on the large chemical inventories that present potential human and environmental exposure scenarios, as well as to provide sufficient coverage of chemical and biological space to enable effective modeling of toxicity. Utilizing high-throughput screening methods developed in the drug discovery community, this in vitro-based approach focuses on the mechanisms of chemico-biological interactions by using large chemical libraries to probe key molecular targets and signaling pathways. Computational toxicology has emerged as a critical component in handling the large and complex datasets required for developing and validating this approach. Insight into these interactions will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular and biological basis of toxicity and result in greater confidence in extrapolations, as well as factors critical to risk assessment such as significant susceptibility factors, subpopulations at risk, and influences on the shape of the dose-response curve. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The biodiesel program is based on three ""fundamental pillars"": social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic viability. The majority of the nation's biodiesel is derived from soy, which raises problems for both social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Soy has been implicated in destruction of Amazon and Cerrado biomes. However, as the world's second largest soybean producer, Brazil's soy complex serves multiple domestic and international markets. The tremendous expansion of soy largely predated the introduction of biodiesel. The cultivated area grew much more rapidly in the five years prior to the policy than in the five years after its implementation, possibly driven more by demand for soymeal than for oil used to make biodiesel. Thus, attribution of environmental impacts is unclear. Further, while the policy of social inclusion requires that a portion of feedstock be sourced from small farmers, the industry's dependence on soy makes this questionable. Soy tends to be planted in large and heavily mechanized monoculture plantations that are not amenable to smallholder inclusion. Efforts to introduce alternative crops deemed more environmentally or socially sustainable, like Jatropha curcas, castor, oil palm, and some native palms, have not gained much momentum and they have seen little utilization as biodiesel feedstocks. This chapter examines the implications of dependence on soy for the sustainability of Brazil's biodiesel industry and discusses the prospects for larger volumes of alternative feedstocks to be introduced. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

Viper was the most toxic formulated herbicide. It was hypothesized that the toxicity of both formulated herbicides could have been enhanced by adjuvants, especially for Viper. In most cases, the sublethal endpoints were the most sensitive and affected by both formulations, comparatively to their acute effects. Concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models provided an accurate description of Mikado and Viper joint action on algae growth and immobilization of daphnids, although significant deviations were always detected. A low-dose antagonism and high-dose synergism were identified for P. subcapitata, whereas C. vulgaris response deviated antagonistically from CA and synergistically from IA. For both daphnids, however, synergistic effects were observed for higher mixture concentrations. Under a regulatory standpoint, CA provided the most conservative estimation either because the mixture effects were overestimated or less subestimated than IA. Overall, the great sensitivity differences observed within species did not allow the conclusion that one trophic level was more tolerant than the other. Instead, P. subcapitata was always the most sensitive species to both herbicide formulations, followed by D. longispina, while D. magna and C. vulgaris were the most tolerant species. On a whole, further studies are needed toward a comprehensive understanding of herbicides mode of action, their effects at lower biological-level endpoints, and under different mixture designs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Ethylmethanesulfonate, at a single dose of 10 mg/L, was used as positive control. Micronuclei were evaluated on the peripheral erythrocytes. Both Treflan and trifluralin treatments significantly increased the micronucleus frequencies in peripheral erythrocytes of O. niloticus.

However, glyphosate spreads to water bodies by spray-drift, run-off and leaching, potentially causing detrimental effects on non-target biota. There is no information on the occurrence of this herbicide in water bodies near crop fields in Mexico, although it is the most commonly used pesticide in this country. To fill this gap, we quantified glyphosate in water bodies from twenty-three locations, including natural protected areas and agricultural areas in southern Mexico, during the dry and the rainy seasons. We expected (1) higher concentrations during the dry season due to reduced dilution by precipitation and, (2) absence of glyphosate in the protected areas. In agreement with our expectation, concentration of glyphosate was higher during the dry season (up to 36.7 μg/L). Nonetheless, glyphosate was detected in all samples-including natural protected areas.

Borggaard O.K.; Gimsing A.L.,Fate of glyphosate in soil and the possibility of leaching to ground and surface waters: A review,2008,Pest Management Science,64,441,456,10.1002/ps.1512,"The very wide use of glyphosate to control weeds in agricultural, silvicultural and urban areas throughout the world requires that special attention be paid to its possible transport from terrestrial to aquatic environments. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the state of knowledge on sorption, degradation and leachability of glyphosate in soils. Difficulties of drawing clear and unambiguous conclusions because of strong soil dependency and limited conclusive investigations are pointed out. Nevertheless, the risk of ground and surface water pollution by glyphosate seems limited because of sorption onto variable-charge soil minerals, e.g. aluminium and iron oxides, and because of microbial degradation. Although sorption and degradation are affected by many factors that might be expected to affect glyphosate mobility in soils, glyphosate leaching seems mainly determined by soil structure and rainfall. Limited leaching has been observed in non-structured sandy soils, while subsurface leaching to drainage systems was observed in a structured soil with preferential flow in macropores, but only when high rainfall followed glyphosate application. Glyphosate in drainage water runs into surface waters but not necessarily to groundwater because it may be sorbed and degraded in deeper soil layers before reaching the groundwater. Although the transport of glyphosate from land to water environments seems very limited, knowledge about subsurface leaching and surface runoff of glyphosate as well as the importance of this transport as related to ground and surface water quality is scarce. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry."

Cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) and MTT assays as well as Neutral Red uptake were employed for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity evaluation. Activities were tested within the concentration range of 0.25-15μg/ml S-metolachlor for 24h of exposure. Both compounds rendered a minor reduction in the NDI although not reaching statistical significance. Results demonstrated that the S-metolachlor was not able to induce MNs. On the other hand, 0.5-6μg/ml Twin Pack Gold® increased the frequency of MNs. When cytotoxicity was estimated, S-metolachlor was not able to induce either a reduction of lysosomal or mitochondrial activity. Contrarily, whereas 1-15μg/ml Twin Pack Gold® induced a significant reduction of mitochondrial activity, all tested concentrations of the formulated product induced a significant decrease of lysosomal performance as a function of the concentration of the S-metolachlor-based formulation titrated into cultures. Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity differences obtained with pure S-metolachlor and the commercial S-metolachlor-based formulation indicate that the latter may contain additional unsafe xenobiotics and support the concept of the importance of evaluating not only the active principle but also the commercial formulation when estimating the real hazard from agrochemicals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

We investigated the aquatic toxicity of five commercial wood preservative products, the biocidal active substances and some formulation additives contained therein, as well as six generic binary mixtures of the active substances in the fish embryo toxicity test (FET). Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the single substances, the mixtures, and the products were estimated from concentration-response curves and corrected for concentrations measured in the test medium. The comparison of the experimentally observed mixture toxicity with the toxicity predicted by the concept of concentration addition (CA) showed less than twofold deviation for all binary mixtures of the active substances and for three of the biocidal products. A more than 60-fold underestimation of the toxicity of the fourth product by the CA prediction was detected and could be explained fully by the toxicity of one formulation additive, which had been labeled as a hazardous substance. The reason for the 4.6-fold underestimation of toxicity of the fifth product could not be explained unambiguously. Overall, the FET was found to be a suitable screening tool to verify whether the toxicity of formulated wood preservatives can reliably be predicted by CA. Applied as a quick and simple nonanimal screening test, the FET may support approaches of applying component-based mixture toxicity predictions within the environmental risk assessment of biocidal products, which is required according to European regulations. © 2012 SETAC."

To treat contaminated waters and to verify if the unknown components which add toxicity have been removed represent a challenge. Nanofiltration and permeate analysis by toxicity tests with fish are an interesting alternative to evaluate the process. Permeates of solutions with concentrations five times above the lethal doses (48. mg/l) did not present toxicity, pointing that all toxic compounds were removed at the same time. Glyphosate rejection over an 80% despite its molecular weight is lower than membrane MWCO, this could be associated to a predominant Donnan exclusion mechanism, combined with dielectric exclusion due to the solute high charge density. Glyphosate concentration did not show any effect over rejection. It increased when pressure was incremented from 2.5 to 4. bar and then remained constant in a 4-10. bar range. Because of dissociation of the glyphosate and the surface charged of the membrane depend on pH value, the rejection increase from 72.5 to 92.5% when pH increase from 4 to 8.5. Studies with river water showed the same behavior with a slight decrease in rejection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

These substances are potentially toxic pollutants because they induce the production of reactive oxygen species for biological systems and exert oxidative stress in nontarget organisms living in the treated aquatic systems. Recent evidence suggests differences in the toxicity of glyphosate in the form of an active ingredient compared to the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with surfactants, such as those found in commercial formulations. In Mexico, one of the most widely used glyphosate-based herbicides is Yerbimat, which has agricultural as well as aquatic weed control applications. However, there are no aquatic toxicity data, particularly regarding native fish. Therefore, we determined the acute toxicity of commercial-formulation Yerbimat in a static bioassay at 96 h (LC 50). We also determined its toxicity at 96 h in sublethal concentrations to assess the lipid peroxidation levels (LPX), catalase activity, hepatic glycogen content, and histological damage in the liver and gills of the fish Goodea atripinnis associated with chronic exposure (75 days). The LC 50 was 38.95 ± 0.33 mg/L. The results of the short-term exposure study indicate that Yerbimat can potentially induce oxidative stress in G. atripinnis, because LPX was increased in the gills and liver. Catalase activity was reduced in the gills but increased in the liver, whereas hepatic glycogen was depleted. Chronic exposure was associated with histopathological damage in the gills and liver, some of which was irreversible. Yerbimat represents a potential risk for aquatic biota; therefore, we recommend that its application be carefully considered. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
Ciarlo T.J.; Mullin C.A.; Frazier J.L.; Schmehl D.R.,Learning impairment in honey bees caused by agricultural spray adjuvants,2012,PLoS ONE,7,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0040848,"Background: Spray adjuvants are often applied to crops in conjunction with agricultural pesticides in order to boost the efficacy of the active ingredient(s). The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 μg organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. Conclusions/Significance: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions.

The author evaluates various sources of exposure, including air, water, and soil pollution; in utero exposure; chemicals contained in foods, cosmetics, and domestic cleaning products; adhesives and paints; industrial chemicals; pesticides; electromagnetic radiation; and chemicals ingested or inhaled during the use of alcohol, tobacco and narcotics. Human Toxicology of Chemical Mixtures also examines the interplay between exposure to these mixtures and the prevalence of various diseases and conditions, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental neurotoxicology, multiple chemical sensitivity (MSC), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM), Gulf war syndrome, cancer and cancer clusters. The author also discusses how exposure to these mixtures yields the above diseases and conditions in different populations: fetuses, infants, pre-adolescent children, adolescents and adults. Finally, the book addresses the profound policy implications for formulation, labeling and use of chemical products, and it proposes more stringent exposure limits and warning requirements in light of the newly recognized toxic effects that are directly attributable to the mixture of toxic lipophilic and hydrophilic chemicals. * Addresses chemical mixtures, while most literature only deals with single chemicals exposure. * Explains why certain toxicological effects are observed. * Discusses diagnosis and treatment of injuries resulting from exposure. * Explores consequences of effects on product formulation, use, handling and required warnings. * Provides guidelines for safer development of personal care, cosmetic, industrial and consumer use products. © 2008 William Andrew Inc.

The survey revealed that cardamom had consumed 26.59 kg a.i ha-1 in comparison with tea (8.70kg a.i ha-1). Pesticide intensity of cardamom (0.0322 kg kg-1) was higher than tea (0.0046 kg kg-1). Risk weighed active ingredients values were 3.326 and 0.029 kg ha-1 for cardamom and tea respectively. The pesticide use intensity in major cardamom growing areas of the CHR has experienced significant increase from 2002 and 2003. It was 7.10 kg a.i ha-1 in the year 2002 and decreased slightly to 5.42 kg a.i ha-1 for the year 2003. The number of pesticide sprays has been increased during the last two years (2011-2012). Pesticide residues in soils of all three cardamom growing hot spots were high. Hospital data of these cardamom hot spot regions showed higher levels of pesticide poisonings particularly for organophosphorous compounds. Therefore, the analysis and results reported here on pesticide consumption by cardamom and tea must be taken seriously to safeguard the degraded rainforest cardamom agroforestry system.

Studied pesticides were the insecticides, cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, and the herbicide, glyphosate. Results were analyzed and compared according to statistical endpoints (LCx) and log-probit regressions of toxicity data. The potency of acute toxicity followed the order: chlorpyrifos F>chlorpyrifos a.i.>cypermethrin F>cypermethrin a.i. ⋘ glyphosate F>glyphosate a.i. Three to five orders of magnitude differences between the toxicity (μg/L to mg/L) of insecticides and the herbicide were observed. A pairwise comparison between a.i. and F indicated that all formulations were more potent. Additionally, for the case of glyphosate, evidence suggests that the adjuvant contributes to formulation toxicity rather than to the enhancement of a.i. potency. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014."

In this work, a continuous small-scale bioprocess to degrade the herbicide propanil, its main catabolic by-product, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA), and the herbicide adjuvants is carried out. A microbial consortium, constituted by nine bacterial genera, was selected. The isolated strains, identified by amplification and sequencing of their 16S rDNA, were: Acidovorax sp., Luteibacter (rhizovicinus), Xanthomonas sp., Flavobacterium sp., Variovorax sp., Acinetobacter (calcoaceticus), Pseudomonas sp., Rhodococcus sp., and Kocuria sp. The ability of the microbial consortium to degrade the herbicide was evaluated in a biofilm reactor at propanil loading rates ranging from 1.9 to 36.8 mg L-1 h-1. Complete removal of propanil, 3,4-DCA, chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon was obtained at propanil loading rates up to 24.9 mg L-1 h-1. At higher loading rates, the removal efficiencies decayed. Four of the identified strains could grow individually in propanil, and 3,4-DCA: Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Rhodococcus sp., and Xanthomonas sp. The Kokuria strain grew on 3,4-DCA, but not on propanil. The first three bacteria have been related to biodegradation of phenyl urea herbicides or chlorinated anilines. Although some strains of the genera Xanthomonas and Kocuria have a role in the biodegradation of several xenobiotic compounds, as far as we know, there are no reports about degradation of propanil by Xanthomonas or 3,4-DCA by Kocuria species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

However, with some remediation processes, the breakdown products are more toxic than the original contaminant. Organic matter and salinity may also influence degradation efficiency. This study tested the efficiency of Fenton oxidation in degrading the sulfonylurea herbicide metsulfuron methyl (MeS), and tested the reaction products for phytotoxicity with the Lemna (duckweed) bioassay. The efficiency of degradation by Fenton's reagent (Fe2+=0.09mM; H2O2=1.76mM, 4h) decreased with increasing initial MeS concentration, from 98% with 5mg/L MeS, to 63% with 70mg/L MeS. Addition of NaCl (10mM) and organic matter (humic acid at 0.2 and 2.0mg C/L as Total Organic Carbon) reduced the efficiency of degradation at low initial MeS concentrations (5 and 10mg/L), but had no effect at high concentrations. The residual Fenton's reagent after Fenton's oxidation was toxic to Lemna. After removal of residual iron and H2O2, the measured toxicity to Lemna in the treated samples could be explained by the concentrations of MeS as measured by HPLC/UV detection, so there was no evidence of additional toxicity or amelioration due to the by-products or formulation materials. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

Such requirements concern active ingredient(s), generally not considering the noxious potential of commercial formulations. This work intends to contribute with novel information on the effects of short-term exposures to two herbicides, with different modes of action (Spasor®, Stam Novel Flo 480®), and an insecticide (Lannate®), as well as to corresponding active ingredients (Glyphosate, Propanil and Methomyl, respectively). The microalga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (growth inhibition), the cladoceran Daphnia magna (immobilisation), and the earthworm Eisenia andrei (avoidance behaviour) were used as test species. Both herbicides were innocuous to all test organisms at environmentally realistic concentrations, except for Stam and Propanil (highly toxic for Pseudokirchneriella; moderately toxic to Daphnia). Lannate and Methomyl were highly toxic to Daphnia and caused Eisenia to significantly avoid the spiked soil at realistic application rates. The toxicity of formulations either overestimated (e.g. Stam/Propanil for P. subcapitata) or underestimated (e.g. Stam/Propanil for D. magna) that of the active ingredient. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased in the liver and decreased in muscle, while oxidative damage to lipids increased above control values in both tissues, showing that the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress are involved in the toxicity induced by Roundup®. Additionally, tadpoles' hyperactivity was associated with tachycardia in vivo, probably due to a stress-induced adrenergic stimulation. Ventricle strips of Roundup®-exposed tadpoles (R-group) presented a faster relaxation and also a higher cardiac pumping capacity at the in vivo contraction frequency, indicating that bullfrog tadpoles were able to perform cardiac mechanistic adjustments to face Roundup ®-exposure. However, the lower maximal in vitro contraction frequency of the R-group could limit its in vivo cardiac performance, when the adrenergic-stimulation is present. The association between the high energetic cost to counteract the harmful effects of this herbicide and the induction of oxidative stress suggest that low and realistic concentrations of Roundup ® can have an impact on tadpoles' performance and success, jeopardizing their survival and/or population establishment. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

It has been showed that atrazine is one of the most frequently detected pesticides in agricultural streams and rivers, over the past two decades. Although the toxic properties of atrazine are well known, the data on the genotoxic effects of atrazine on aquatic organisms are rather scarce. Thus, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of atrazine and an atrazine-based herbicide (Gesaprim®) on a model fish species Carassius auratus L., 1758, (Pisces: Cyprinidae) using the micronucleus test and the comet assay in peripheral blood erythrocytes. Fish were exposed to 5, 10 and 15μg/L atrazine and to its commercial formulation for 2, 4 and 6. days. Ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) at a single dose of 5. mg/L was used as positive control. Our results revealed significant increases in the frequencies of micronuclei and DNA strand breaks in erythrocytes of C. auratus, following exposure to commercial formulation of atrazine and thus demonstrated the genotoxic potential of this pesticide on fish. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common 'inert' ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated. © 2014 Zhu et al."
Zeliger H.I.,Human Toxicology of Chemical Mixtures,2011,Human Toxicology of Chemical Mixtures,,,,10.1016/C2010-0-67068-4,"In this important reference work, Zeliger catalogs the known effects of chemical mixtures on the human body and also proposes a framework for understanding and predicting their actions in terms of lipophile (fat soluble) / hydrophile (water soluble) interactions. The author's focus is on illnesses that ensue following exposures to mixtures of chemicals that cannot be attributed to any one component of the mixture. In the first part the mechanisms of chemical absorption at a molecular and macromolecular level are explained, as well as the body's methods of defending itself against xenobiotic intrusion. Part II examines the sources of the chemicals discusssed, looking at air and water pollution, food additives, pharmaceuticals, etc. Part III, which includes numerous case studies, examines specific effects of particular mixtures on particular body systems and organs and presents a theoretical framework for predicting what the effects of uncharacterized mixtures might be. Part IV covers regulatory requirements and the need to adjust recommended exposure levels for products containing mixtures. It also contains recommendations on how to limit exposure to mixtures in the products we use and on how to limit release of mixtures into the environment. Providing brief summaries of each mixture and its effects, Zeliger provides a comprehensive reference, a jumping off point for professionals (with extensive chapter bibliographies) and an introduction to the topic for those studying traditional toxicology. Addressing many inadequately understood illnesses and conditions such as asthma, infertility and cancer, it will also be of interest to health professionals, environmental scientists and lawyers. .

Nevertheless, little is known about the toxic effects of formulated herbicides, since many studies have been carried out using pure active molecules alone. In this work, we used as an eukaryotic model system an autochthonous wine yeast strain to investigate the effects of three commercial herbicides, currently used in the same geographical area from where this strain had been isolated. We carried out a comparative proteomic analysis to study the effects at the protein level of the herbicide-related stress, and found that the herbicides tested can alter the yeast proteome producing responses that share homologies with those observed treating yeast cells with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or with well-known oxidizing agents. We evaluated, through redox-proteomic techniques, protein carbonylation as a biomarker of oxidative stress.

Preftakes C.J.; Schleier III J.J.; Peterson R.K.D.,Bystander exposure to ultra-low-volume insecticide applications used for adult mosquito management,2011,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,8,2142,2152,10.3390/ijerph8062142,"A popular and effective management option for adult mosquitoes is the use of insecticides applied by ultra-low-volume (ULV) equipment. However, there is a paucity of data on human dermal exposure to insecticides applied by this method. The objective of the current study was to estimate dermal exposures to the insecticide active ingredient permethrin using water- (Aqua-Reslin®) and oil-based (Permanone® 30-30) formulations with passive dosimetry. No significant differences in deposition of permethrin were observed between years, distance from the spray source, front or back of the body, or the placement of the patches on the body. However, exposure to Aqua-Reslin was significantly greater than Permanone 30-30 and average concentrations deposited on the body were 4.2 and 2.1 ng/cm2, respectively. The greater deposition of Aqua-Reslin is most likely due to the higher density of the water-based formulation which causes it to settle out faster than the lighter oil-based formulation of Permanone 30-30. The estimated average absorbed dermal exposure for permethrin from Aqua-Reslin and Permanone 30-30 was 0.00009 and 0.00005 mg/kg body weight, respectively. We also found that ground deposition of ULV insecticides can be used as a surrogate for estimating dermal exposure. The estimated exposures support the findings of previous risk assessments that exposure to ULV applications used for mosquito management are below regulatory levels of concern. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Cells were treated for 24. h within the 0.25-15 μg/ml concentration range. FLC and Twin Pack Gold® induced a significant and equivalent increase in SCEs regardless of the concentration. Rainbow®-induced SCEs at concentrations higher than 2.5 μg/ml; however, the increases were always lower than those induced by FLC and Twin Pack Gold®. For all compounds, the PRI decreased as a function of the concentration titrated into cultures. Whereas only the highest FLC and Twin Pack Gold® concentrations induced a significant reduction of the MI, all tested Rainbow® concentrations induced MI inhibition. Overall, the results demonstrated that although all compounds were not able to reduce the lysosomal activity, the mitochondrial activity was diminished when the highest concentrations were employed. These observations represent the first study analyzing the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects exerted by FLC and two formulated products on mammalian cells in vitro, at least on CHO-K1 cells. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
Marques C.; Pereira R.; Gonçalves F.,Using earthworm avoidance behaviour to assess the toxicity of formulated herbicides and their active ingredients on natural soils,2009,Journal of Soils and Sediments,9,137,147,10.1007/s11368-009-0058-0,"Background, aim, and scope: Soil quality has been threatened by intensive agricultural practises, namely those relying on the application of pesticides, such as herbicides. Among the non-target terrestrial organisms exposed to such scenarios, earthworms are key ecological receptors widely used in ecotoxicological studies. As such, this work aims to assess the effects of two herbicide active ingredients (a.i.)-sulcotrione and penoxsulam-and their respective commercial formulations-MIKADO® and VIPER® (referred as Mikado and Viper)-on the avoidance behaviour of Eisenia andrei. In an attempt to enhance the ecological relevance of the generated toxicity data, the avoidance tests were run with standard (LUFA 2.2; L) and natural soils (from corn and rice fields), as long as their habitat function did not constrain the earthworm behaviour. Methodology: Earthworms were bred in the lab before test conductance. The natural soils used as substrates were collected before the cropping season on corn (C) and rice (R) fields, which are integrated in a wide area exploited for agriculture. Their physico-chemical characterization evolved the determination of pH (H2O, KCl), conductivity, organic matter (OM) and clay/silt contents, and water-holding capacity (WHC). The avoidance tests intended to ascertain (1) the random distribution of earthworms in the natural soils C and R (dual-control tests), (2) the habitat function of natural soils against each other and against L soil, (3) the effect of active ingredients and formulated herbicides on E. andrei behaviour. Avoidance tests with the a.i.s were only performed in L soil. Data evaluation followed ISO (2005) guidelines. Results: C and R soils presented higher OM (5.1% and 4.5%, respectively) and clay/silt (53.3 and 43.1, respectively) contents and WHC (107.2 and 109.9%, respectively) than L soil (4.1, 21.4 and 48.0%, correspondingly). Earthworms distributed randomly in dual-control tests, but preferred R soil significantly, relative to L or C soils. The LOEC and EC50 values calculated for sulcotrione (>1,000.0 and 1,263.3 mg a.i. kg-1, respectively) and Mikado (1,012.8 and 1,301.3 mg a.i. kg-1, respectively) were much higher than those calculated for penoxsulam (100 and 80.6 mg a.i. kg -1, respectively) or Viper (52.7 and 51.5 mg a.i. kg-1, respectively), when L soil was used as substrate. Moreover, the habitat function of L soil contaminated with the formulated herbicide Viper was more constrained relative to that of the a.i. penoxsulam. Viper induced higher % avoidance on E. andrei exposed to the contaminated L soil compared to that under the R soil. Discussion: The response of earthworms to R (attraction) and C (avoidance) soils could be related, not only to the quantity of OM content, but also to the quality of organic and inorganic fractions of soil, beyond other intrinsic properties of soils. Both Mikado and sulcotrione impacted the behaviour of E. andrei only slightly. This endpoint was more affected under penoxsulam or Viper exposures on L soil, being the latter-formulated product even more repellent for E. andrei than the a.i. The effect of adjuvants added to the commercial formulation of Viper, may have increased the toxicity of the a.i. Thereby, our results reinforce the need for a careful assessment of the impacts of formulated products. Furthermore, since there was a reduction in earthworm % avoidance under Viper exposures on the natural soil R, it was possible that pesticide bioavailability had been reduced by its sorption to OM and clay mineral sorption sites. Conclusions: Though the standard L soil should be used for reproducibility and comparison means, other natural soils should be added to the assessment of chemicals, for sake of ecological relevance. Both herbicides induced avoidance behaviour on E. andrei, albeit stronger effects were denoted by penoxsulam and its respective formulated product, Viper. Overall, avoidance tests provided a sensitive, valuable and feasible response either to compare the habitat function of different standard and agricultural natural soils or to test the effect of herbicides. Recommendations and perspectives: An effort should be made to enlarge the terrestrial ecotoxicological database as a way to fulfil the huge lack of information available for this ecosystem. In this context, additional research congregating a potential linkage between physiological activities sustaining the regular metabolism of earthworms and their avoidance behaviour or even their reproductive effects would be welcomed, especially in what regards formulated pesticides. Such approach would provide a robust and comprehensive understanding of chemical effects. Furthermore, it is encouraged that natural soils should be used to improve the reliability of chemical testing. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."

The gross morphological and skeletal features were studied on day 10 and day 15 of the incubation period. The pesticide caused musculoskeletal deformities in skin, limbs, head, neck, skull, lower body and overall reduction in ossification of skeleton. The embryolethality percentage was highest at the highest dose and lower in the lowest dose. However, incidence of malformations was found to be significant and showed increase with the increasing concentrations of the toxicant. Thus, insecticide Marshal EC with active ingredient Carbosulfan is a potent teratogen with reference to avian systems."

To get a better insight into the content of micronuclei (MN) and other chromatin instabilities, lymphocyte preparations were hybridized using pancentromeric DNA probes. Frequency of the MN, nuclear buds (NB) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) in cultures treated with glyphosate slightly increased from 3.5 μg/ml onward. Presence of S9 significantly elevated cytome assay parameters only at 580 μg/ml. No concentration-related increase of centromere (C+) and DAPI signals (DAPI+) was observed for glyphosate treatment. Terbuthylazine treatment showed a dose dependent increase in the number of MN without S9 significant at 0.0008 μg/ml and higher. At concentration lower than 1/16 LD50 occurrence of C+MN was significantly elevated regardless of S9, but not dose related, and in the presence of S9 only NBs containing centromere signals were observed. Carbofuran treatment showed concentration-dependent increase in the number of MN. The frequency of C + MN was significant from 0.008 μg/ml onward regardless of S9. Results suggest that lower concentrations of glyphosate have no hazardous effects on DNA, while terbuthylazine and carbofuran revealed a predominant aneugenic potential. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This dilution level is far below agricultural recommendations and corresponds to low levels of residues in food or feed. The formulations have been compared to G alone and with its main metabolite AMPA or with one known adjuvant of R formulations, POEA. HUVEC primary neonate umbilical cord vein cells have been tested with 293 embryonic kidney and JEG3 placental cell lines. All R formulations cause total cell death within 24 h, through an inhibition of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, and necrosis, by release of cytosolic adenylate kinase measuring membrane damage. They also induce apoptosis via activation of enzymatic caspases 3/7 activity. This is confirmed by characteristic DNA fragmentation, nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), which is demonstrated by DAPI in apoptotic round cells. G provokes only apoptosis, and HUVEC are 100 times more sensitive overall at this level. The deleterious effects are not proportional to G concentrations but rather depend on the nature of the adjuvants. AMPA and POEA separately and synergistically damage cell membranes like R but at different concentrations. Their mixtures are generally even more harmful with G. In conclusion, the R adjuvants like POEA change human cell permeability and amplify toxicity induced already by G, through apoptosis and necrosis. The real threshold of G toxicity must take into account the presence of adjuvants but also G metabolism and time-amplified effects or bioaccumulation. This should be discussed when analyzing the in vivo toxic actions of R. This work clearly confirms that the adjuvants in Roundup formulations are not inert. Moreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death around residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R formulation-treated crops. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

To clarify the effects of three herbicides as commercial formulations (namely, Pointer, Silglif, and Proper Energy), parameters related to oxidative issues were investigated on an autochthonous wine yeast strain. It was demonstrated that herbicides were able to affect the enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, as well as to induce carbonylation and thiol oxidation as post-translational modifications of proteins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an optimal model system to study responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress. Thus, the results obtained could further the understanding of mechanisms underlying the toxicity of herbicides. © 2008 American Chemical Society."
Wagner N.; Reichenbecher W.; Teichmann H.; Tappeser B.; Lötters S.,Questions concerning the potential impact of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians,2013,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,32,1688,1700,10.1002/etc.2268,"Use of glyphosate-based herbicides is increasing worldwide. The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration. © 2013 SETAC."

This paper formulates an answer based on two approaches. Starting from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) definition for green chemistry, production-based and environmental-impact-based definitions for green adjuvants are proposed. According to the production-based approach, adjuvants are defined as green if they are manufactured using renewable raw materials as much as possible while making efficient use of energy, preferably renewable energy. According to the environmental impact approach, adjuvants are defined as green (1) if they have a low human and environmental impact, (2) if they do not increase active ingredient environmental mobility and/or toxicity to humans and non-target organisms, (3) if they do not increase the exposure to these active substances and (4) if they lower the impact of formulated pesticides by enhancing the performance of active ingredients, thus potentially lowering the required dosage of active ingredients. Based on both approaches, a tentative definition for 'green adjuvants' is given, and future research and legislation directions are set out. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry."

The upcoming new EU regulation concerning the introduction of plant protection products on the market (EC1107/2009) includes for the first time the demand for information on the possible negative effects of not only the active ingredients but also the used adjuvants. This new regulation requires basic toxicological information that allows decisions on the use/ban or preference of use of available adjuvants. In this study we obtained toxicological relevant information through a multiple endpoint reporter assay for a broad selection of commonly used adjuvants including several solvents (e.g. isophorone) and non-ionic surfactants (e.g. ethoxylated alcohols). The used assay allows the toxicity screening in a mechanistic way, with direct measurement of specific toxicological responses (e.g. oxidative stress, DNA damage, membrane damage and general cell lesions). The results show that the selected solvents are less toxic than the surfactants, suggesting that solvents may have a preference of use, but further research on more compounds is needed to confirm this observation. The gene expression profiles of the selected surfactants reveal that a phenol (ethoxylated tristyrylphenol) and an organosilicone surfactant (ethoxylated trisiloxane) show little or no inductions at EC 20 concentrations, making them preferred surfactants for use in different applications. The organosilicone surfactant shows little or no toxicity and good adjuvant properties. However, this study also illustrates possible genotoxicity (induction of the bacterial SOS response) for several surfactants (POEA, AE, tri-EO, EO FA and EO NP) and one solvent (gamma-butyrolactone). Although the number of compounds that were evaluated is rather limited (13), the results show that the used reporter assay is a promising tool to rank commonly used agricultural adjuvants based on toxicity and toxic mode of action data. © 2011 Nobels et al."

The need for a better understanding of the extent of undisclosed information in chemicals arose from collecting data on the hazards and exposures of chemicals used in typical mining operations (copper, platinum and coal). Four main categories of undisclosed chemicals were defined (incomplete disclosure; chemicals with unspecific identities; relative quantities of ingredients not stated; and trade secret ingredients) by reviewing material safety data sheet (MSDS) omissions in previous studies. A significant number of chemicals (20% of 957 different chemicals) across the three sites had a range of undisclosed information, with majority of the chemicals (39%) having unspecific identities. The majority of undisclosed information was found in commercially available motor oils followed by cleaning products and mechanical maintenance products, as opposed to reagents critical to the main mining processes. All three types of chemicals had trade secrets, unspecific chemical identities and incomplete disclosures. These types of undisclosed information pose a hindrance to a full understanding of the hazards, which is made worse when combined with additional MSDS omissions such as acute toxicity endpoints (LD50) and/or acute aquatic toxicity endpoints (LC50), as well as inadequate hazard classifications of ingredients. The communication of the hazard information in the MSDSs varied according to the chemical type, the manufacturer and the regulations governing the MSDSs. Undisclosed information can undermine occupational health protection, compromise the safety of workers in industry, hinder risk assessment procedures and cause uncertainty about future health. It comes down to the duty of care that industries have towards their employees. With a wide range of chemicals increasingly used, there is a balance that needs to be reached between disclosure requirements, trade secret provisions and definitions of hazardous ingredients for market needs, and the information required to protect the health of their workers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Significantly higher bulky DNA-adduct levels were observed for samples collected from April to July, compared with samples collected during the other months. Agricultural practices were not significantly different between these two groups of farmers, but interestingly, the mean and the median duration without exposure to pesticides were significantly shorter for farmers sampled between April and July.These data, obtained in a homogeneous population of farmers, indicate a genotoxic impact for a sub-group, with a potential association with the use of pesticides.

Cumulative 14CO2 release was estimated to be approximately 6% or less of the amount of [14C]glyphosate originally added in both soils over an 80-d incubation. For all but the highest Cu treatments (400mgkg-1) in the coarse-textured Arkport soil, mineralization began without a lag phase and declined over time. No inhibition of mineralization was observed for Zn up to 400mgkg-1 in either soil, suggesting differential sensitivity of glyphosate mineralization to the types of metal and soil. Interestingly, Zn appeared to alleviate high-Cu inhibition of mineralization in the Arkport soil. The protective role of Zn against Cu toxicity was also observed in the pure culture study with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that increased mineralization rates in high Cu soil with Zn additions might have been due to alleviation of cellular toxicity by Zn rather than a mineralization specific mechanism. Extensive use of glyphosate combined with its reduced degradation in Cu-contaminated, coarse-textured soils may increase glyphosate persistence in soil and consequently facilitate Cu and glyphosate mobilization in the soil environment.

The authors collected data on usage and trends of agricultural pesticides through agriculture-related databases. Criteria from the US Environmental Protection Agency classification for carcinogenicity, World Health Organization classification for acute toxicity, and European Union prioritization list for endocrine-disrupting chemicals were used for the hazard categorization of identified individual active ingredients. Pesticides to be prioritized among all pesticides used in South Korea between 2007 and 2011 were selected by taking into account the volume of usage, toxicity, and epidemiological evidence. Annual agricultural use of pesticides has increased rapidly from the 1970s to 1990s in South Korea, but has declined since 2001. The quantity of pesticides used in 2011 was reported as 19,131 tons, and was comprised of 34.7% insecticides, 28.0% fungicides, and 27.1% herbicides. The 50 pesticides with the greatest volume of usage accounted for 82.6% of the total volume of pesticides used between 2007 and 2011, with the most-used active ingredient being machine oil, followed by mancozeb and then paraquat. Organophosphates were the most used among the top 50 pesticides. A total of 24 pesticides were selected for recommendation of intensive regulation in South Korea. In conclusion, the authors described the usage and trends of overall agricultural pesticides, which would serve as a fundamental step forward in managing pesticide in terms of public health. Intensive efforts are required for the prevention of potential health effects from the 24 identified pesticides. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

In this respect, soil plots were contaminated with Vertimec ® 18EC at the concentration indicated for strawberry crops (0.125L of solution m -2). After the contamination, torrential rainfall was simulated and the surface runoff was collected and transferred to mesocosm tanks in five treatments, run in triplicate: (1) control-C; (2) runoff from an uncontaminated plot-UR; (3) runoff from the plot contaminated with Vertimec ® 18EC-CR; (4) direct application of Vertimec ® 18EC in the water-V and (5) water samples gathered randomly to verify whether there was contamination between the mesocosms-RS. Water samples from these tanks were also submitted to ecotoxicological tests with Daphnia similis and analyses to evaluate the limnological characteristics, in five collection periods over 10 days (240h). Physical and chemical differences were observed in the water samples, mainly related to increased turbidity, suspended solids and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate forms). Acute toxicity was observed for the direct application treatment for the entire experimental period, and in some periods for the CR treatment (from 48h to 168h). The results obtained suggest that the pesticide did not fully degrade during the study period (10 days) in the direct application treatment, demonstrating that the presence of other substances in the commercial formulation contribute to the maintenance of toxicity. This represents a potential risk for aquatic ecosystems in areas adjacent to where the chemical is applied. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

In the current study, acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the IMI-containing commercial formulation insecticide Glacoxan Imida (35 percent IMI) was evaluated on Hypsiboas pulchellus (Anura: Hylidae) tadpoles exposed under laboratory conditions. A lethal effect was evaluated as the end point for lethality, whereas micronucleus (MN) frequency and DNA single-strand breaks evaluated by the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay were employed as end points for genotoxicity. Sublethal end points were assayed within the 12.5-37.5mg/L IMI concentration range.

In general, formulations were more toxic than the active ingredients, but differences in LC50 and ECx values were significant only in two cases and not more than a factor of 2.0. This could mainly be due to masking of the effects of additives in the soil. Comparison with available survival data revealed that P. excavatus is more sensitive than the standard test species Eisenia andrei or E. fetida. The use of tropical species in the risk assessment of pesticides in tropical regions should therefore be encouraged. Crown Copyright © 2009."
Pereira J.L.; Mendes C.D.; Gonçalves F.,Acute and chronic effects of a mixture of formulated pesticides and its corresponding active ingredients in Daphnia magna,2009,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,18,1281,1288,,"Agricultural practices worldwide include the use of pesticides either as single-chemical or multiple-chemical applications aiming higher efficiency in controlling grass weeds and animal pests. Pesticides may easily reach and contaminate surface waterbodies mainly through drainage and spray drift, and hence are currently viewed as a major contamination issue. Following recent discussion on the ability of adjuvant chemicals added to marketed formulations to contribute for pesticide toxicity, this study focuses the acute and chronic toxicity of the insecticide Lannate® and the herbicide Stam Novel Flo®, as well as that of their active ingredients Methomyl and Propanil, to the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher long-term than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments. These results suggest that long-term exposures can provide relevant complementary information on mixtures' toxicity that should be taken into account within pesticide risk assessment procedures. © by PSP."

Controlled residue studies show that glyphosate persists in food crops, allowing for the potential of a large number of people to be exposed. Glyphosate is generally considered safe however there are a number of studies suggesting formulations or additives that may have adverse health effects. To assess the degree of exposure of pregnant women, this study measured glyphosate in composite food samples and estimated exposure based on food frequency questionnaire. 43 pregnant women were recruited and completed a self administered questionnaire with a food frequency component and provided a composite food sample. Twenty food samples were analysed with very low glyphosate concentrations (mean 0.08. mg/kg, range 0.002-0.5. mg/kg) with residues detected in more than 75% of the samples. Maternal dietary exposure was very low (0.001. mg/kg bw/day) and was considerably lower than the predicted National Estimated Daily Intake of glyphosate (0.02. mg/kg bw/day). The estimated exposure based on measured glyphosate in composite food samples corresponded to 0.4% of the acceptable daily intake for glyphosate, and the predicted concentration from dietary information was 4% which is comparable to the National Estimated Daily Intake of 5.5% of the Acceptable Daily Intake of glyphosate. Prenatal exposures were estimated to be significantly lower. While residues of glyphosate are present in food, this study demonstrates that exposure concentrations are low and confirms the current models used to estimate glyphosate exposure. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH."

Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar® and Termidor®. Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7d growth was observed at 10% of the 24h LC10 (53μgLμ1) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24h LC10 (0.14μgLμ1) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24h LC10 of Talstar® (0.03μgLμ1). Fipronil and Termidor® led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142μgLμ1 and 148μgLμ1 respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

The hypothesis whether the consideration of active substances together with all formulation additives that are labeled as presenting an environmental hazard is sufficient for a reliable environmental risk assessment was tested in the present study by investigating 3 wood preservative products. Relevant single substances in the products, some of their generic mixtures, the biocidal products themselves, and aqueous eluates prepared from the products (representing potential environmental mixtures) were tested for effects on algal growth and Daphnia acute immobilization as well as reproduction. Predictions for the products and the eluates were based on the concept of concentration addition and were mostly found to provide reliable or at least protective estimates for the observed acute and chronic toxicity of the mixtures. The mixture toxicity considerations also indicated that the toxicity of each product was dominated by just 1 of the components, and that assessments based only on the dominating substance would be similarly protective as a full-mixture risk assessment. Yet, there remained uncertainty in some cases that could be related to the toxicity of transformation products, the impact of unidentified formulation additives, or synergistic interaction between active substances and formulation additives. © 2013 SETAC."

For this, mice were exposed from 23 days of age (PND) until PND 45 to glyphosate (50 mg/kg, per os) or saline solution, and, ten days after the end of treatments, male and female mice were observed in the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) or forced swimming test (FWT). Results showed that exposure to glyphosate: 1) reduced the locomotion frequency of male mice similarly to female mice in the OF and female mice had an increase in rearing behavior and in the immobility time; 2) reduced in male mice the motor activity both in the OF and EPM, while no effects were observed in female mice; 3) in the SWT male mice had a decreased time of float similarly female mice. We concluded that pre-pubertal exposure to glyphosate reduced in male mice the capacity of exploration in the OF and EPM tests suggesting that the herbicide interfered with the central mechanism related to brain masculinization of exploratory and anxiety behavioral models. In the FWT it was observed a decreased depressive response in male mice while in female an increased response was detected. © 2014, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

The author’s focus is on illnesses that ensue following exposures to mixtures of chemicals that cannot be attributed to any one component of the mixture. In the first part the mechanisms of chemical absorption at a molecular and macromolecular level are explained, as well as the body’s methods of defending itself against xenobiotic intrusion. Part II examines the sources of the chemicals discusssed, looking at air and water pollution, food additives, pharmaceuticals, etc. Part III, which includes numerous case studies, examines specific effects of particular mixtures on particular body systems and organs and presents a theoretical framework for predicting what the effects of uncharacterized mixtures might be. Part IV covers regulatory requirements and the need to adjust recommended exposure levels for products containing mixtures. It also contains recommendations on how to limit exposure to mixtures in the products we use and on how to limit release of mixtures into the environment. Providing brief summaries of each mixture and its effects, Zeliger provides a comprehensive reference, a jumping off point for professionals (with extensive chapter bibliographies) and an introduction to the topic for those studying traditional toxicology.

Sorvari J.; Jaakkonen S.,Environmental risks caused by pesticides at forest nurseries in Finland,2011,Human and Ecological Risk Assessment,17,431,466,10.1080/10807039.2011.552398,"Previously, various persistent pesticides were used extensively in the production of seedlings at Finnish forest nurseries. The extent and magnitude of the risks arising from the consequent environmental contamination are largely unknown. Therefore, we selected two representative nurseries for which we conducted tiered health risk assessments (HRA) using risk-based benchmarks and two calculation tools (SSL and Risc-Human software). Ecological risk assessments (ERA) involved comparisons of environmental concentrations with ecotoxicological benchmarks. Site investigations revealed that the concentration of several pesticides exceeded the Finnish soil quality guidelines in some places. The compost pile for organic residues and the pond receiving runoffs contained traces of pesticides and the maximum concentration of atrazine and terbuthylazine in groundwater exceeded the corresponding guideline for household water. Hexachlorobenzene proved to pose the highest health risks, the maximum hazard quotient being around 10 (carcinogenity-based) in the residential land use scenario. Owing to the conservative assumptions, health risks are expected to remain insignificant, however. Risks to the local terrestrial ecosystem would also remain low, while only further studies will reveal the actual risks to the adjoining aquatic ecosystem. Both calculation tools showed shortcomings that generate uncertainty in the HRA, whereas the ERA was hampered particularly by the lack of benchmarks. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
Uchida M.; Takumi S.; Tachikawa K.; Yamauchi R.; Goto Y.; Matsusaki H.; Nakamura H.; Kagami Y.; Kusano T.; Arizono K.,Toxicity evaluation of glyphosate agrochemical components using Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) and DNA microarray gene expression analysis,2012,Journal of Toxicological Sciences,37,245,254,10.2131/jts.37.245,"Using glyphosate agrochemical components, we investigated their acute toxicity to juvenile Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as well as their toxic impact at gene expression level on the liver tissues of adult medaka using DNA microarray. In our acute toxicity test, juvenile medaka were exposed for 96 hr to each of the following glyphosate agrochemical components: 10~160 mg/l of glyphosate, 1.25~20 mg/l of fatty acid alkanolamide surfactant (DA), and 12~416 mg/l of a fully formulated glyphosate herbicide. As a result, LC50 values of glyphosate, DA, and the glyphosate herbicide were > 160 mg/l, 8.5 mg/l, and 76.8 mg/l, respectively. On the other hand, adult male medaka fish were exposed to each of the glyphosate agrochemical components for 48 hr at the following concentrations: 16 mg/l of glyphosate, 0.5 mg/l of DA, and 16 mg/l-glyphosate/0.5 mg/l-DA mixture. Interestingly, DNA microarray analysis revealed that there were no significant gene expression changes in the medaka liver after exposure to glyphosate. Nevertheless, 78 and 138 genes were significantly induced by DA and the glyphosate/DA mixture, respectively. Furthermore, we identified five common genes that were affected by DA and glyphosate/DA mixture. These results suggested that glyphosate itself possessed very low toxicity as previously reported by some researchers at least to the small laboratory fish, and the major toxicity of the glyphosate agrochemical resided mainly in DA and perhaps in unintentionally generated byproduct(s) of glyphosate-DA mixture."

A lethal effect was used as the end point for mortality, whereas frequency of micronuclei (MNs) and DNA single-strand breaks evaluated by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay were employed as end points for genotoxicity. Mortality studies revealed an LC50 96h value of 1639mg/L (range, 1471-1808) of dicamba. Furthermore, behavioral changes, e.g., gathering at the bottom of the aquarium, slowness in motion, abnormal swimming, and slow reaction, were observed. Whereas increased frequency of MNs was observed when 1229mg/L dicamba was assayed for 48h, no induction of MNs was observed in fish exposed to the herbicide for 96h, regardless of the concentration of dicamba. Furthermore, other nuclear abnormalities, i.e., binucleated cells and lobed and notched nuclei, were induced in fish exposed for 48h but not 96h. Increase in the genetic damage index was observed in those treatments (lasting for both 48 and 96h) within the 410-1229mg/L dicamba concentration-range. This study represents the first evidence of acute lethal and sublethal effects exerted by dicamba on a piscine species native to Argentina. The results could indicate that dicamba-based formulation Banvel® is the less toxic emerging pollutant reported so far for C. decemmaculatus. Finally, our findings highlight the properties of this herbicide that jeopardize nontarget living species exposed to this agrochemical. © 2014."

Recent studies have found widespread pesticide contamination across the rivers that discharge into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Potential impacts on native fish species exposed to known endocrine disrupting chemicals such as atrazine, simazine, and diuron have not been assessed. In the present study, the authors examined the endocrine and physiological effects of short-term, acute exposure of environmentally relevant concentrations of analytical grade atrazine in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in a controlled laboratory experiment. Expression of hepatic vitellogenin was not affected, supporting results of previous studies that showed that atrazine does not have a direct estrogenic effect via mediation of estrogen receptors. The lack of effect on brain cytochrome P19B (CYP19B) expression levels, combined with increases in testosterone (T) and 17β estradiol and a stable T:17β estradiol ratio, does not support the hypothesis that atrazine has an indirect estrogenic effect via modulation of aromatase expression. Gill ventilation rate, a measure of oxidative stress, did not change in contrast to other studies finding enhanced osmoregulatory disturbance and gill histopathology after atrazine exposure. To more closely reflect field conditions, the authors recommend that laboratory studies should focus more on examining the effects of commercial pesticide formulations that contain additional ingredients that have been found to be disruptive to endocrine function. © 2014 SETAC."

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of triazole (tebuconazole/prothioconazole) fungicide formulation on the induction of chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and DNA fragmentation in bovine cultured lymphocytes. Our results showed that the fungicide formulation did not induce significant number of CAs in bovine cells after 24 h treatment. Nevertheless, the dose-dependent reduction of mitotic division was observed, with the strongest effect at 30.0 μg mL-1 in both donors (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Prolonged 48 h exposure caused the increased level of breaks in treated cultures (3.0-15.0 μg mL-1; P < 0.05) and significant decrease in mitotic index (MI). The tested fungicide failed to produce any statistical changes in the SCE frequency neither after 24 h nor 48 h treatment. However, the significant decline of the proliferation index (PI) was observed after 24 h indicating the fungicide influence on cell cycle kinetics. Prolonged 48 h exposure caused cytotoxicity reflecting in lower PI value relative to control mainly at the highest fungicide concentrations (30.0 μg mL-1, P < 0.001). Using painting probes for bovine chromosomes 1, 5 and 7 (BTA1, BTA5 and BTA7) only low levels of aneuploidies were detected. Significant increase of polyploidy cells (P < 0.05) was induced by a 3.0 μg mL-1 dose of the fungicide after 48 h. DNA fragmentation assay didn't reveal the presence of DNA nucleosome ladder in cell cultures at any time (24 h and 48 h) and fungicide concentration. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

According to the most ancient records, Sumerians applied sulphurous compounds in insect invasion control. Major revolution in pesticide production and use started in the early 1940s with the discovery of pesticidal activity of DDT. Implementation of European Committee Directive 91/414/EEC led to a re-evaluation of active ingredients and detailed regulations for placing plant protection products on the market in EU member countries. As a result of EC directive implementation 740 ingredients have been withdrawn from the market, while 632 have remained in use. At present, in the Republic of Croatia 363 active ingredients are approved for application. Croatia has completed harmonization of its laws with EU positive regulations. Laws and bylaws regulate pesticide registration, risk classification, transport, and acceptable level of occupational and residential exposure to pesticides. Due to continuous release of newly synthesised substances with pesticidal activity (their risk assessment, classification and registration is based on research and studies results), current regulations have to be permanently updated and harmonized. However, due to enforcement of European Commission Directive 2009/128/EC to achieve sustainable use of pesticides, general public awareness regarding health and environment has to be significantly raised, especially among the pesticide handling population. Standard safety procedures during and after the use of pesticides given by the manufacturers as well as personal safety equipment have to be followed."
Zeljezic D.; Vrdoljak A.L.; Lucas J.N.; Lasan R.; Fucic A.; Kopjar N.; Katic J.; Mladinic M.; Radic B.,Effect of occupational exposure to multiple pesticides on translocation yield and chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes of plant workers,2009,Environmental Science and Technology,43,6370,6377,10.1021/es900824t,"Employees handling pesticides are simultaneously exposed to different active substances. Occurring multiple chemical exposures may pose a higher risk than it could be deduced from studies evaluating the effect of a single substance. This study comprised 32 pesticide plantworkers exposed to carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, metalaxyl, and dodine and an equal number of control subjects. Groups were matched by age (43.8 ± 10.16 vs 41.8 ± 7.42, respectively), sex (14 females; 18 males), and smoking (11 smokers; 21 nonsmokers). Chromosome aberration and translocation frequencies were determined using a standard aberration assay and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) by applying painting probes for chromosomes 1, 2, and 4. Although significant, an observed increase in chromatid breaks (5.2 ± 2.49) compared to controls (2.1 ± 0.87), pPostHoc = 0.000001 is biologically irrelevant. Genomic frequency of translocations was also significantly elevated (exposed 0.0165 ± 0.0070; control 0.0051 ± 0.0023, p PostHoc = 0.0000004). The distribution of translocations among chromosomes 1, 2, and 4 did not differ from control subjects. It corresponded to the distribution of DNA content among selected chromosomes indicating randomness of DNA damage. A good translocation yield correlation within years spent in pesticide production indicates that multiple pesticide exposure may pose a risk to genome integrity. However, for more accurate health risk assessments, the use of probes for some other groups of chromosomes should be considered. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

They are applied to agricultural, landscape and structural pest management by governmental agencies, private institutions and individuals. PRIs typically assess only the potential risks associated with the active ingredients because, with few exceptions, pesticide manufacturers disclose only the identity of the active ingredients which generally comprise only a minor portion of pesticide products. We show that when inert ingredients are identified and assessed by the same process as the active ingredient, the product specific risk can be much greater than that calculated for the active ingredient alone. To maintain transparency in risk assessment, all those who develop and apply PRIs or make decisions based on their output, should clearly disclose and discuss the limitations of the method. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The insecticides were given daily, via oral route, in 60 repetitive doses equaled to Acceptable Daily Intake ""ADI"" (0.02 & 0.30 mg a.i.kg-1b.w.), No Observed Adverse Effect Level ""NOAEL"" (9.00 & 29.00 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w.) and 1/100 LD50 (37.38 & 13.75 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w.) of spinosad and malathion respectively. Results of cytogenetic effects indicated that spinosad (37.38 mg a.i. kg-1 b.w.) and malathion (13.75 & 29.00 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w.) induced significant decrease in mitotic activity (MI %) and increased micronucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (MN %) in rat's bone marrow cells. The MN % recorded 0.36% in control rats, compared to 0.96% for spinosad at 37.38 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w. and 1.46 and 1.93% for malathion at 13.75 and 29.00 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w., respectively. Except the treatment with 0.02 mg a.i. kg-1 b.w. (ADI) of spinosad, the other tested doses of both insecticides showed significant increase in the percentage of chromosomal aberrations in rat's bone marrow cells. The percentage of chromosomal aberration (excluding gaps) recorded 0.66, 1.33 and 3.66% for spinosad at 0.02, 9.00 and 37.38 mg a.i. kg-1 b.w., respectively. In case of malathion, such values recorded 3.00, 6.33 and 6.66% at 0.30, 13.75 and 29.00 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w., respectively. The obtained cytogenetic effects occurred in a dose-dependent manner. After 45 days of treatment, testosterone concentration significantly decreased (P ≤ 0.05) at a dose levels of 9.00 and 37.38 mg a.i.kg-1 b.w. spinosad and 0.30 mg a.i. kg-1 b.w. malathion. At the other tested doses, malathion caused highly significant decrease (P ≤ 0.01) in testosterone concentration. Moreover, varieties of histopathological lesions were identified in the examined testes. The incidence and severity of these lesions appeared to increase with increasing dose and the most pronounced pathological changes were necrosis of spermatogonial cells, congest in blood vessels and exfoliation of necrotic cells within the somniferous lumen. The tested doses of both insecticides recorded observable significant decrease in the absolute testes weights and the lowest value (2.18 g) was resulted from malathion at the 1/100 LD50 (29.00 mg a.i. kg-1 b.w.). Except the treatment with 0.02 mg a.i. kg -1 of spinosad, the other tested doses of both insecticides showed significant decrease in body weight gains. Generally, cytogenetic and reproductive effects, as well as alteration in testosterone level, were observed in a dose-dependent manner and malathion exhibited more pronounced effect than spinosad."

The objective of this investigation was to examine the association between ever having an HPEE and CNS function among licensed pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). Methods: In 2006-2008, 693 male participants with no history of a physician-diagnosed pesticide poisoning completed nine neurobehavioral tests to assess memory, motor speed, sustained attention, verbal learning, and visual scanning and processing. Information on ever having an HPEE and pesticide poisonings was obtained from previous AHS interviews. Associations between ever having an HPEE and neurobehavioral outcomes were estimated with linear regression controlling for age and outcome-specific covariates. Results: A history of ever having an HPEE was reported by 156 (23%) participants. Adverse associations were observed between ever having an HPEE and two of the nine neurobehavioral tests. On a test of visual scanning and processing (Digit-Symbol), participants who ever had an HPEE were 4.2 s slower (95% CI: -7.27, -1.11) than those without an HPEE, equivalent to the effect of 3.9 years of age in this population. On a test of visual scanning and motor speed (Sequences A), participants who ever had an HPEE were 2.5 s slower (95% CI: -4.53, -0.41) than those without an HPEE, equivalent to the effect of 3.9 years of age. No significant associations were observed between participants who ever had an HPEE and the remaining neurobehavioral tests. Conclusions: One or more HPEE may contribute to adverse CNS outcomes independent of diagnosed pesticide poisoning. © Springer-Verlag 2011."
Dick F.D.,"Pesticides: Herbicides, insecticides and rodenticides",2010,Environmental Medicine,,297,308,,"Pesticides are a diverse group of agents employed to control living organisms that pose health or economic threats. They may be manmade (synthetic) or naturally occurring (biological) and may be active against a narrow (selective) or wide (broad spectrum) range of pests. Some act on contact, whereas others do so systemically. They are often grouped by the pest they control (e.g. insecticides) but may be categorized by chemical structure. For example, insecticides can be categorized as carbamates, organochlorines and so on.

In females, all treated groups died 2-3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls, the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by GMO and Roundup treatments. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5-5.5 times higher. This pathology was confirmed by optic and transmission electron microscopy. Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3-2.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600. days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76% of the altered parameters were kidney related. These results can be explained by the non linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, but also by the overexpression of the transgene in the GMO and its metabolic consequences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

We examined the toxic and genotoxic effects of malathion, a commonly used organophosphorus pesticide, in the larvae of Indian skittering frog (Euflictis cyanophlyctis). The different concentrations of malathion (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0mg/L) tested in a 2×6 factorial design, induced concentration-dependent lethality in tadpoles in the presence and absence of predator cues. The 96h LC50 for malathion in the presence and absence of predator stress were 3.523mg/L and 3.588mg/L, respectively. The 15-day LC50 value for malathion was estimated to be 2.452mg/L. Lower concentrations of malathion extending into the sublethal range (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mg/L) induced micronuclei (MN) in the erythrocytes of tadpoles at 24h (F 3,56=70.291, p<0.001), 48h (F 3,56=78.423, p<0.001), 72h (F 3,56=88.817, p<0.001) and 96h (F 3,56=64.770, p<0.001) in a concentration-dependent manner. Predator stress significantly enhanced the MN frequency at 48h following 1.0mg/L malathion treatment (p<0.001). The present report is the first one to analyze genotoxic effect of malathion in the presence of predator stress. These results suggest that predator stress may potentiate the genotoxic effect of lower concentrations of malathion in E. cyanophlyctis tadpoles. These effects may have long-term fitness consequence to the population as a whole. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

According to German regulations, herbicides can be applied in mixtures with variable intensities. The ecological impact of the resulting strategies is still poorly understood. However, it was hypothesized that the influence of herbicide strategies on earthworm abundance, biomass, and diversity is minor compared to environment and tillage intensity in sugar beet. Therefore, additional specific factor variation seemed to be a prerequisite for getting valuable results. The herbicide strategies were applied in a ploughing system and a mulching system in 19 environments (site × year) in Germany in 2008 and 2009. Earthworm expulsions were carried out in spring and autumn with 2204 samples in total.The earthworm population was determined by environment and tillage system rather than by herbicide strategies. The environments displayed the largest variability in earthworm abundance, ranging from 12 to 195individualsm -2, and a considerable variation in the occurrence of earthworm species. In spring, the deleterious impact of ploughing, with 80% lower mean earthworm abundance compared to the mulching system, was observed across all environments. During vegetation, the stronger increase in earthworm population in the ploughing system did not compensate for the initial differences. Regardless of intensity, the herbicide strategies were not accompanied by corresponding detrimental effects on earthworms between each other. In conclusion, the earthworm population was subjected to a multiplicity of influencing factors and the results markedly demonstrated for the first time the negligible effect of herbicide application intensity in sugar beet. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: i) control (C), ii) AS at 500ngL -1 (P500), iii) AS at 800ngL -1 (P800) and iv) Prowl 400® at 500ngL -1 (Pw). After a 28day exposure period (D28), 10 fish were sampled for each condition and 10 other after a 15day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). Pendimethalin concentrations in the exposure water and muscles were followed. White blood cell counts, differential leucocyte counts, cell mortality and phagocytosis activity were measured. Haemolytic alternative complement activity, lysozyme concentration and stress parameters were analyzed.The resulting concentration of pendimethalin in the exposure water was lower than the expected concentration. At D28, the concentration quantified in the contaminated fish was negligible in comparison with the Reference Dose for Oral Exposure estimated by US-EPA's Integrated Risk Information System. Leucopenia was noted in all contaminated fish. A decrease in phagocytosis activity and ACH 50 was also observed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Disturbed lysozyme activity was noted only in fish exposed to Pw. Furthermore, during exposure to a similar concentration of pendimethalin, the commercial product seemed to be more immunotoxic than the AS alone. Finally, at D43, the effects proved reversible for sanitary status while immunity was still disturbed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. © 2012."

Results: The complete register reported 44,931 cases of poisoning with an average of 6,418 cases per year and a global progressive increase of 2,123 cases in the entire period. It reported 14,145 cases of pesticide poisoning. Of these, 10,100 cases were due to the effects of the insecticides organophospate and carbamate. The number of cases by gender was 7,102 (50.21%) males and 7,043 (49.79%) females. The major age group affected was adolescents and young adults. Conclusion: In Ecuador, pesticide poisoning occurs in individuals of both sexes who are between 15 to 25 years old and work in adverse conditions as agricultural farmers. The poisoning especially occurs in flower and banana plantation workers throughout the country. Seventy-one percent of the cases are due to organophosphate and carbamate poisonings, which cause death in 4% of the cases; 57% die in the first 48 h, possibly because of the acute action of AChE inhibitors. The long-term effects of pesticides are still unclear and need further research. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
Coors A.; Frische T.,Predicting the aquatic toxicity of commercial pesticide mixtures,2011,Environmental Sciences Europe,23,,,10.1186/2190-4715-23-22,"Background: Previous studies reported on a large (> 80%) compliance between the observed toxicity of pesticide mixtures and their toxicity as predicted by the concept of concentration addition (CA). The present study extents these findings to commercially sold and frequently applied pesticide mixtures by investigating whether the aquatic toxicity of 66 herbicidal and 53 fungicidal combination products, i.e., authorized plant protection products that contain two or more active substances, can reliably be predicted by CA. Results: In more than 50% of cases, the predicted and observed mixture toxicity deviated by less than factor 2. An indication for a synergistic interaction was only detected with regard to algal growth inhibition for mixtures of fungicides that inhibit different enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis. The greatest degree of compliance between prediction and observation was found for the acute toxicity of fungicidal products towards Daphnia and fish, while the greatest degree of underestimation of product toxicity occurred for the acute toxicity of herbicidal products towards Daphnia and fish. Using the lowest available toxicity measures within taxonomic groups as the most conservative approach resulted in a bias towards overestimation of product toxicity, but did not eliminate cases of considerable underestimation of product toxicity. Conclusions: The results suggest that the CA concept can be applied to predict the aquatic toxicity of commercial pesticide mixtures using the heterogeneous data typically available in a risk assessment context for a number of clearly identified combinations of test species and pesticide types with reasonably small uncertainty. © 2011 Coors and Frische; licensee Springer."
