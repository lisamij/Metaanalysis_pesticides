"Gomes I.N.; Gontijo L.M.; Lima M.A.P.; Zanuncio J.S., Jr; Resende H.C.",The survival and flight capacity of commercial honeybees and endangered stingless bees are impaired by common agrochemicals,2023,Ecotoxicology,32,937,947,10.1007/s10646-023-02699-8,"The impact of agrochemicals on native Brazilian bees may be underestimated, since studies of non-target effects on bees have, by and large, concerned mostly the Apis mellifera L. Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate – Roundup®], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity. Taken altogether, the results highlight the importance of testing the impact of multiple agrochemicals (i.e. not just insecticides) through different routes of exposure in order to understand more comprehensively the potential risks for Apis and non-Apis bees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Our work aimed to compare the toxicity induced by chlorpyrifos in its pure form (CPF) with that of a commercial formulation containing allegedly inert ingredients (CBCF) using Caenorhabditis elegans as in vivo model. After a 48 h exposure period, CBCF was 14 times more lethal than CPF; Hatching, brood size, body length and motor-related behavioral parameters were decreased, but these effects were significantly higher in CBCF-exposed worms. Additionally, CBCF induced significant morphological changes in cholinergic neurons, which are associated with the motor-related behavioral parameters. Finally, by analyzing the CBCF, we detected the presence of potentially-toxic metals that were not specified in the label. The presented results highlight the toxicological relevance of components present in the commercial formulations of pesticides, which have been claimed as inert compounds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Physiological manifestation of respiratory stress was measured using the rate of oxygen consumption while behavioral toxicity was measured using crawling reflexes, touch response, and mucus production. The threshold effect values for LOEC (Lowest Observed Effect Concentration), NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration), and MATC (Maximum Acceptable Toxicant Concentration) at 96 h were 0.40, 0.60, and 0.075 mg/l, respectively. Definitive 96 h acute exposures for both respiratory and behavioral endpoints tests were determined using a control group and concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 1.60 mg/l monitored for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Test organisms irrespective of exposure concentration demonstrated an initial rise in oxygen consumption rate after 24 h, followed by a progressive decrease in toxicant concentration and exposure period. The in silico structural analysis presents triazophos as having an electrophilic toxic structure similar to choline esterase inhibitors, and also capable of inducing oxidative stress. The AOP highlighted neurotoxicity and oxidative stress as plausible pathways of triazophos toxicity in mollusk species. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
Malka E.; Margel S.,Engineering of PVA/PVP Hydrogels for Agricultural Applications,2023,Gels,9,,,10.3390/gels9110895,"Hydrogels have gained significant popularity in agricultural applications in terms of minimizing waste and mitigating the negative environmental impact of agrochemicals. This review specifically examines the utilization of environmentally friendly, shapable hydrogels composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in various casings for crop protection against different pests, fertilizing, and watering. To activate their effectiveness, PVA/PVP hydrogels were loaded with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environmentally friendly pesticides, namely hydrogen peroxide (HP), the essential oil thymol, and urea as a fertilizer, either separately or in combination. This review covers various physical and chemical approaches used for loading, shaping, and controlling the release profiles of pesticides and fertilizers. Additionally, it explores the evaluation of the chemical composition, structure, classification, rheology, and morphology of the hydrogels as well as their impact on the thermal stability of the encapsulated pesticides and fertilizer, followed by biological tests. These hydrogels significantly contribute to the stabilization and controlled release of essential nutrients and biocides for plants, while maintaining excellent biocidal and fertilizing properties as well as sustainability characteristics. By shedding light on the latest insights into the concepts, applications, and results of these hydrogels, this review demonstrates their immense potential for widespread future use in agriculture. © 2023 by the authors."
Eghbalinejad M.; López-Cabeza R.; Kotouček J.; Grillo R.; Koutný M.; Bílková Z.; Hofman J.,Effects of three tebuconazole nanopesticides on the survival of Daphnia magna,2024,Environmental Science: Nano,11,1044,1059,10.1039/d3en00673e,"The growing pressure to reduce excessive pesticide use has led to exploring novel formulation methods, including nanoparticle carriers for active substances. However, these emerging nanopesticides need a thorough evaluation compared to current formulations to determine whether their “nano” properties intensify toxicity for non-target organisms. This study assessed the lethal toxicity of three nanopesticides on Daphnia magna. The nanopesticides tested were tebuconazole loaded onto poly-ϵ-caprolactone, nanostructured lipid carriers, and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles. Additionally, the study evaluated the toxicity of nanocarriers without loaded tebuconazole, a commercial tebuconazole formulation, and tebuconazole (pure). Effects were studied across a series of dilutions to examine the impacts on tebuconazole chemistry (total and free concentrations) and particle physics (size, heterogeneity, and density). D. magna exhibited varied responses to polymeric and lipid nanoformulations of tebuconazole and unloaded nanocarriers. The observed toxicity levels, from highest to lowest, were as follows: pure tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on nanostructured lipid carriers > commercial tebuconazole > tebuconazole-loaded on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) nanoparticles > tebuconazole-loaded on poly-ϵ-caprolactone. The mechanisms underlying the observed toxicity can generally be attributed to chemical factors (tebuconazole's free concentration and particle composition) and physical aspects (particle size and concentration). The study also revealed that dilution series can influence particle size and homogeneity, affecting the loaded substance's chemistry. This implies that the toxicity testing of nanopesticides is complex and not as straightforward as traditional dose-response modeling. Research like this is crucial to understanding the ecological impacts of nanopesticides, ensuring that new nanoformulations are beneficial rather than detrimental for plant protection. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry"

Fungicide triazoles and strobilurins based are the most widely used and require a specific effort to investigate toxicological effects on non-target species. This study evaluates the toxic effects of four commercial fungicides Prosaro® (tebuconazole and prothioconazole), Amistar®Xtra (azoxystrobin and cyproconazole), Mirador® (azoxystrobin) and Icarus® (Tebuconazole) on Eisenia fetida using several biomarkers: lipid peroxidation (LPO), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), total glutathione (GSHt), DNA fragmentation (comet assay) and lysozyme activity tested for the first time in E. fetida. The exposure to Mirador® and AmistarXtra® caused an imbalance of ROS species, leading to the inhibition of the immune system. AmistarXtra® and Prosaro®, composed of two active ingredients, induced significant DNA alteration, indicating genotoxic effects. This study broadened our knowledge of the effects of pesticide product formulations on earthworms and showed the need for improvement in the evaluation of toxicological risk deriving from the changing of physicochemical and toxicological properties that occur when a commercial formulation contains more than one active ingredient and several unknown co-formulants. © The Author(s) 2024."
Ashu F.A.; Fouet C.; Ambadiang M.M.; Penlap-Beng V.; Kamdem C.,Vegetable oil-based surfactants are adjuvants that enhance the efficacy of neonicotinoid insecticides and can bias susceptibility testing in adult mosquitoes,2023,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,17,,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011737,"Background The standard operating procedure for testing the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes to neoni-cotinoid or butenolide insecticides recommends using a vegetable oil ester (Mero) as a sur-factant. However, there is growing evidence that this adjuvant contains surfactants that can enhance insecticide activity, mask resistance and bias the bioassay. Methodology/Principal findings Using standard bioassays, we tested the effects of commercial formulations of vegetable oil-based surfactants similar to Mero on the activity of a spectrum of active ingredients including four neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and two pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). We found that three different brands of linseed oil soap used as cleaning products drastically enhanced neonicotinoid activity in Anopheles mosquitoes. At 1% (v/v), the surfactant reduced the median lethal concentration, LC50, of clothianidin more than 10-fold both in susceptible and in resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae. At 1% or 0.5% (v/v), linseed oil soap restored the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes fully to clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid and partially to acetamiprid. By contrast, adding soap to the active ingredient did not significantly affect the level of resistance to permethrin or deltamethrin suggesting that vegetable oil-based surfactants specifi-cally enhance the potency of some classes of insecticides. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that surfactants are not inert ingredients, and their use in susceptibility testing may jeopardize the ability to detect resistance. Further research is needed to evalu-ate the potential, the limitations and the challenges of using some surfactants as adjuvants to enhance the potency of some chemicals applied in mosquito control. © 2023 Ashu et al."
Battisti L.; Potrich M.; Lozano E.R.; dos Reis Martinez C.B.; Sofia S.H.,Review on the sublethal effects of pure and formulated glyphosate on bees: Emphasis on social bees,2023,Journal of Applied Entomology,147,1,18,10.1111/jen.13089,"Bees are declining worldwide, and the use of pesticides has been linked to this problem. Studies show that even herbicides can negatively impact bees, causing death or compromising health. As a result, concern about the use of glyphosate (GLY) has increased, as it is the most sold pesticide. Studies have shown that exposure of bees to GLY can trigger sublethal effects. Considering the speed with which information is published, reviews become important for the integration of knowledge, aiding understanding of the topic. Therefore, the present study aimed to review the literature on the sublethal effects of GLY and the different commercial formulations on bees. After the literary review, it was observed that the exposition, acute and chronic, of larvae and adults of social and solitary bees, to GLY and its formulations, can trigger alterations in gene expression, enzyme functioning, oxidative metabolism, cell/tissue structure, intestinal microbiota diversity, learning, food consumption, flight and vertical displacement capacity, circadian cycle and body development of these insects. The most used species in the studies was Apis mellifera L. Studies are still necessary to understand the sublethal effects of GLY on bees, in the medium and long term, on colony homeostasis, especially about the information on the toxicity of some surfactants present in the different commercial formulations. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."

Since the development of 2,4-D resistant transgenic crops, it has been described as one of the most widely distributed pollutants in the world, increasing concern about its environmental impacts. This study aimed to elucidate the antioxidant system response in animals exposed to 2,4-D by different routes of exposure. It focused on determining if tissue, phylogenetic group, and herbicide formulation would influence the antioxidant mechanisms. A careful literature search of Scopus, WoS, and Science Direct retrieved 6983, 24,098, and 20,616 articles, respectively. The dataset comprised 390 control-treatment comparisons and included three routes of exposure: transgenerational, oral, and topical. The data set for transgenerational and oral exposure revealed oxidative stress through a decrease in enzymatic activities and the level of molecules of the antioxidant system. In contrast, topical exposure increased the oxidative stress. Tissue-specific analyses revealed that the transgenerational effects reduced hepatic catalase (CAT) activity. Oral exposure caused a variety of effects, including increased CAT activity in the prostate and decreased activity in various tissues. Mammals predominate in the transgenerational and oral groups, showing a significantly reduced activity of the antioxidant system. In contrast, in the topical exposure, an increased activity of oxidative stress biomarkers was observed in fish, earthworms, and mollusks. The effects of the 2,4-D formulation on oxidative stress responses showed significant differences between pure and commercial formulations, with oral exposure resulting in decreased activity and topical exposure increasing responses. In summary, orally exposed animals exhibited a clear decrease in enzyme activities, transgenerational exposure elicited tissue-specific prompted biochemical reductions, and topical exposure induced increased responses, emphasizing the need for unbiased exploration of the effects of 2,4-D on biomarkers of oxidative stress while addressing publication bias in oral and topical datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
Nechalioti P.-M.; Karampatzakis T.; Mesnage R.; Antoniou M.N.; Ibragim M.; Tsatsakis A.; Docea A.O.; Nepka C.; Kouretas D.,"Evaluation of perinatal exposure of glyphosate and its mixture with 2,4-D and dicamba οn liver redox status in Wistar rats",2023,Environmental Research,228,,,10.1016/j.envres.2023.115906,"Wide-scale emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds has led to an increase in the simultaneous application of herbicide mixtures exacerbated by the introduction of crops tolerant to glyphosate plus dicamba or glyphosate plus 2,4-D. This raises serious concerns regarding the environmental and health risks resulting from increased exposure to a mixture of herbicide active ingredients. We evaluated hepatotoxic effects following perinatal exposure to glyphosate alone or in combination with 2,4-D and dicamba from gestational day-6 until adulthood in Wistar rats. Animals were administered with glyphosate at the European Union (EU) acceptable daily intake (ADI; 0.5 mg/kg bw/day) and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL; 50 mg/kg bw/day). A mixture of glyphosate with 2,4-D (0.3 mg/kg bw/day) and dicamba (0.02 mg/kg bw/day) with each at their EU ADI was evaluated. Redox status was determined by measuring levels of reduced glutathione, decomposition rate of Η2Ο2, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity, thiobarbituric reactive substances, and protein carbonyls. Gene expression analysis of Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Clec2g, Ier3, and Gadd45g associated with oxidative damage to DNA, was also performed. Analysis of liver samples showed that exposure to the mixture of the three herbicides induced a marked increase in the concentration of glutathione and malondialdehyde indicative of a disturbance in redox balance. Nevertheless, the effect of increased lipid peroxidation was not discernible following a 3-month recuperation period where animals were withdrawn from pesticide exposure post-weaning. Interestingly, toxic effects caused by prenatal exposure to the glyphosate NOAEL were present after the same 3-month recovery period. No statistically significant changes in the expression of genes linked with genotoxicity were observed. Our findings reinforce the importance of assessing the combined effects of chemical pollutants at doses that are asserted by regulatory agencies to be safe individually. © 2023"

Therefore, designing a precise regulating strategy to balance the toxicity and bioactivity of MCs is urgently needed. Here, we prepared a series of pyraclostrobin-loaded MCs with different wall materials, particle sizes, core density and shell compactness using interfacial polymerization. The results showed that the MCs released more slowly in water with increasing particle sizes and capsule compactness, and they sunk more quickly with the increasing particle sizes and core density. Additionally, MCs with slower release speed was always accompanied with lower acute toxicity levels to zebrafish. When the release dynamics slowed down to the threshold dose on demand for disease control, facilitating settlement of MCs can further reduce toxicity within spatial and temporal dimensions. The poor accumulation of MCs with larger particle sizes or dense shell in gills was closely related to their efficient detoxification. Importantly, seven of the MCs samples possessed superior selectivity between bio-performance in controlling rice blast and toxicological hazard to fish compared to commercial formulations. The results provide a comprehensive guidance for developing an efficient and safe pesticide delivery system. © 2023"
James D.G.,"Monarch Butterflies in Western North America: A Holistic Review of Population Trends, Ecology, Stressors, Resilience and Adaptation",2024,Insects,15,,,10.3390/insects15010040,"Monarch butterfly populations in western North America suffered a substantial decline, from millions of butterflies overwintering in California in the 1980s to less than 400,000 at the beginning of the 21st century. The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides in the mid–1990s and their subsequent widespread use appears to be the most likely major factor behind this sudden decline. Habitat loss and unfavorable climates (high temperatures, aridity, and winter storms) have also played important and ongoing roles. These factors kept overwintering populations stable but below 300,000 during 2001–2017. Late winter storm mortality and consequent poor spring reproduction drove winter populations to less than 30,000 butterflies during 2018–2019. Record high temperatures in California during the fall of 2020 appeared to prematurely terminate monarch migration, resulting in the lowest overwintering population (1899) ever recorded. Many migrants formed winter-breeding populations in urban areas. Normal seasonal temperatures in the autumns of 2021 and 2022 enabled overwintering populations to return to around the 300,000 level, characteristic of the previous two decades. Natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, parasites, and pathogens) may be important regional or local drivers at times but they are a consistent and fundamental part of monarch ecology. Human interference (capture, rearing) likely has the least impact on monarch populations. The rearing of monarch caterpillars, particularly by children, is an important human link to nature that has positive ramifications for insect conservation beyond monarch butterflies and should be encouraged. © 2024 by the author."
Gunawan A.P.; Utama D.N.,Decision support model to assess pesticide safeness toward environment,2024,Environmental Analysis Health and Toxicology,39,,,10.5620/eaht.2024003,"For farmers around the world to protect crops from disturbing pests, it is common to use pesticides to ward off the growth of pests or even eliminate them. Even though pesticides are seen as a good thing for protecting crops, there is one thing that mustn’t be forgotten the origin of the pesticide itself is a toxin compound that is dangerous if used irresponsibly. The main concern of this study is excessive use of pesticides may cause serious consequences to the ecosystem and environment through the accumulation of pesticide residue by irresponsible farmers. To minimize the effects of pesticide residues, the selection of the type of pesticide needs to be considered which type may not be harmful to the environment's health even though accumulation happens. Therefore, in this study, a fuzzy-based computational model assessor was built to measure the safety level of pesticides toward the environment. The fuzzy model was created with consideration of several parameters related to pesticide behaviors, its effects on beneficial organisms, and its persistence in the environment. The method used for this study includes literature reviewing, fuzzification, statistical approach, expert knowledge sharing, and quantitative analysis. The model created in this study can assist in a more accurate and realistic method of selecting better pesticide options that will be used by farmers. To ensure the validity of the model, verifying and validating the formula and pesticide result assessment were done with related literature articles. In this study, from 10 types of pesticides used as a sample, dodine, and iprodione pesticides are the best option for protecting crops with a safety level of 7.36, and abamectin, dimethoate, chorpyrifos, and methidathion are not safe options for farming use because of its potential of harming the environment. © 2024 The Korean Society of Environmental Health and Toxicology/Korea Society for Environmental Analysis."

However, owing to its irritability, volatility, instability under light/oxygen and hydrophobicity, the application of TTO in pharmaceutical production technology and the food industry is limited. To overcome these problems, TTO nanoemulsions (TTONs) were prepared using a high-speed shearing method. The mean droplets size of TTON was measured. TTON droplets were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and analysed using a Turbiscan scanning spectrum. The most suitable nanoemulsion formula was obtained as follows: TTO content, 10% (w/w); Tw-40 content, 8% (w/w); deionised water content, 82% (w/w); shearing time, 5 minutes. The antibacterial effect of TTON was studied, and it was found that its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was more potent than that against Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial mechanism of TTON was also investigated by observing bacterial morphology using scanning electron microscopy and testing the levels of bacterial reactive oxygen species. The effect of TTON on L-02 cells was evaluated. The results showed that the cell survival rates of L-02 cells treated with TTON at 0.05-0.25 μg/μL were all >90%. At each concentration, the total apoptosis rate of L-02 cells was <10%. These results indicated the high biocompatibility and biological safety of TTON. Therefore, the preparation of TTO into a nanoemulsion can improve its bioavailability, which has positive implications for further applications of TTO. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In this line, information about the genotoxic effect of glufosinate-ammonium (GLA) has been reported only for the technical grade. However, humans are frequently exposed to commercial formulations of pesticides. Commercial formulations are characterized by using inner agents that increase toxicity compared to pesticides in technical grade. This study aimed to determine the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of GLA on HepG2 cells. MTT and comet assays were performed to evaluate cell viability and DNA damage, respectively. HepG2 cells were exposed for 24 h to different concentrations of GLA (at 0.01 µg/mL; 0.04 µg/mL; 0.1 µg/mL; 0.24 µg/mL; 0.52 µg/mL; 1.25 µg/mL; 2.62 µg/mL and 13.12 µg/mL) in commercial- (Finale Ultra®) or technical-grade (GLAT). The results indicated that only Finale Ultra® induced a reduction in cell viability at 13.12 µg/mL. Furthermore, exposure to Finale Ultra® or GLAT was associated with increased DNA damage at concentrations from 0.52–13.12- µg/mL.

Still, recent research has shown that these products can cause mortality or trigger sublethal effects in these insects. Roundup Transorb R® (RT) is one of the GLY-based formulations sold in Brazil. It is used in several crops, and studies are required on its toxicity to honey bees. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate, under laboratory conditions, the lethal and sublethal effects of RT for adult workers (foragers) of Africanized A. mellifera. For this, two bioassays were carried out with Africanized honey bees. The experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of five treatments (T0 - control, T25 – 25 % GLY, T50 – 50 % GLY, T75 – 75 % GLY, and T100 GLY – 100 % recommended dose). The bioassays were carried out as follows: (1) Acute oral and topical exposure, evaluating mortality, effects on flight capacity, vertical displacement, and locomotion (in the latter only for oral contamination), consisting of five repetitions and 10 honey bees per repetition; (2) Chronic exposure via the oral route and spraying, assessing mortality, for both contamination routes and damage to the midgut epithelium thickness when contaminated via the oral route, composed of five replicates and 20 honey bees per replicate. The results showed that chronic oral exposure to RT can increase honeybee mortality and damage the thickness of their midgut epithelium. In addition, when acutely exposed orally, the honey bees had reduced walking ability. RT did not affect the other evaluated parameters. Thus, it is concluded that the RT-formulated GLY can affect the survival, midgut morphology, and behavior of A. mellifera. © 2024 The Authors"
Shi L.; Yan W.; Sun L.; Hou C.; Wei N.; Chen Z.; Feng J.,Preparation and characterization of emamectin benzoate nanocapsules based on the dual role of polydopamine,2022,Pest Management Science,78,4407,4416,10.1002/ps.7061,"Background: Developing pesticide-controlled release formulations with foliage adhesion has become the focus of current research in the field of crop protection. In this study, an excellent adhesive nanocapsule loaded with emamectin benzoate (Eb@PDA) was prepared via emulsion interfacial polymerization based on the self-polymerization ability and adhesion properties of polydopamine (PDA). Results: The physicochemical properties of the Eb@PDA were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, particle size statistics, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Eb@PDA presented a regular spherical shape, with an average particle size of 163.8 nm. Compared with conventional formulations, it had higher pesticide-loading content (34%) and excellent adhesion onto corn leaf. In addition, Eb@PDA showed sustained-release characteristics, facilitating the release of Eb at low pH and high temperature. Eb@PDA could effectively protect Eb against photodegradation and had a longer effective period for controlling Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodoptera exigua. Furthermore, acute toxicity tests showed that the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) was 80.91 and 57.91 mg kg−1 at 7 and 14 days, respectively, indicating a lower toxicity of the Eb@PDA to earthworms. The cells (L02) treated with Eb@PDA showed a higher cell viability but a lower apoptosis rate (only 5.75%), demonstrating the lower cytotoxicity of the Eb@PDA. Conclusion: The self-prepared Eb@PDA could be used as a formulation with the advantages of slow release, UV shielding, strong leaf adhesion, superior insecticidal properties, sustained effectiveness and biosafety.

We evaluated ecotoxicological endpoints, behavioral and developmental alterations, and the biochemical detoxifying, neurotoxic, and oxidative stress responses, covering a wide concentration range from environmental to high application levels. Both pyrethroid preparations displayed similar ecotoxicity (median lethal concentration of ~0.5 mg/L), with the lethal effect of Zero® being more pronounced than that of the active ingredient. Sublethal behavioral alterations in natatory activity were observed at 1000 times lower concentrations, indicating the ecological hazard of tadpole exposure to this pyrethroid at environmentally relevant concentrations. Biochemical endpoints in B. pulchella larvae showed significant responses to lambda-cyhalothrin in the ng/L range; these responses were different for the pure or the formulated product, and they were variable at higher concentrations. Principal components analysis confirmed the prevalence of biochemical responses as early endpoints at the lowest lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations; the Integrated Biomarker Response Index proportionally increased with pyrethroid concentration in a similar way for the pure and the formulated products. We conclude that lambda-cyhalothrin is of concern from an environmental perspective, with particular emphasis on autochthonous anuran development. The battery of biochemical biomarkers included in our study showed a consistent integrated biomarker response, indicating that this is a potent tool for monitoring impacts on amphibians.

The toxicity test is a key part of pesticide registration, which includes human health and ecological effect testing. Different countries adopt their own toxicity test criteria for pesticide registration guidelines. However, these differences, which may help accelerate the progress of pesticide registration and reduce the number of animals used, are yet to be explored and compared. Herein, we outlined the details and compared the differences between the toxicity tests in the United States, the European Union, Japan, and China. Some differences lie in the types and waiver policy, while others are in new approach methodologies (NAMs). On the basis of these differences, there is great potential for the optimization of NAMs during the toxicity tests. It is expected that this perspective can contribute to developing and adopting NAMs. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Methods: We conducted a narrative review of occupational risk factors that can be considered to have ""consistent evidence for an association,""or where there is ""limited/inadequate evidence for an association""for 6 NCD groups: nonmalignant respiratory diseases; neurodegenerative diseases; cardiovascular/metabolic diseases; mental disorders; musculoskeletal diseases; and cancer. The assessment was done in expert sessions, primarily based on systematic reviews, supplemented with narrative reviews, reports, and original studies. Subsequently, knowledge gaps were identified, e.g. based on missing information on exposure-response relationships, gender differences, critical time-windows, interactions, and inadequate study quality. Results: We identified over 200 occupational exposures with consistent or limited/inadequate evidence for associations with one or more of 60+ NCDs. Various exposures were identified as possible risk factors for multiple outcomes. Examples are diesel engine exhaust and cadmium, with consistent evidence for lung cancer, but limited/inadequate evidence for other cancer sites, respiratory, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. Other examples are physically heavy work, shift work, and decision latitude/job control. For associations with limited/inadequate evidence, new studies are needed to confirm the association. For risk factors with consistent evidence, improvements in study design, exposure assessment, and case definition could lead to a better understanding of the association and help inform health-based threshold levels. Conclusions: By providing an overview of knowledge gaps in the associations between occupational exposures and their health effects, our narrative review will help setting priorities in occupational health research. Future epidemiological studies should prioritize to include large sample sizes, assess exposures prior to disease onset, and quantify exposures. Potential sources of biases and confounding need to be identified and accounted for in both original studies and systematic reviews.  © 2024 The Author(s)."

Spiromesifen, derived from spirocyclic tetronic acids, is widely used against agricultural pests and is crucial in resistance management due to its unique lipid synthesis inhibition. This study evaluates the insecticidal activity of spiromesifen against temephos-resistant Ae. aegypti populations, focusing on larval body weight, volume, biochemical composition, and adult female reproductive potential. Spiromesifen demonstrated effective larvicidal activity, significantly reducing adult emergence. Resistance to spiromesifen was not observed, with resistance ratios (RR50, RR90) ranging from 0.36- to 3.31-fold. Larvae exposed to LC50 showed significant reductions in body weight and volume, and reduced carbohydrate, lipid, and protein contents. Enhanced catalase activity and malondialdehyde levels indicated increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, highlighting its effects on lipid metabolism. Spiromesifen also exhibited sterilizing effects, significantly reducing fecundity and fertility in adult females, thereby impacting Ae. aegypti reproductive capacity. These findings highlight the potential of spiromesifen as a component of integrated vector management strategies, especially in regions with prevalent insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti, serving as an effective larvicide and impacting adult reproductive outcomes. © 2024 by the authors."
Wu W.-Y.; Liao L.-H.; Lin C.-H.; Johnson R.M.; Berenbaum M.R.,Effects of pesticide-adjuvant combinations used in almond orchards on olfactory responses to social signals in honey bees (Apis mellifera),2023,Scientific Reports,13,,,10.1038/s41598-023-41818-7,"Exposure to agrochemical sprays containing pesticides and tank-mix adjuvants has been implicated in post-bloom mortality, particularly of brood, in honey bee colonies brought into California almond orchards for pollination. Although adjuvants are generally considered to be biologically inert, some adjuvants have exhibited toxicity and sublethal effects, including decreasing survival rates of next-generation queens. Honey bees have a highly developed olfactory system to detect and discriminate among social signals. To investigate the impact of pesticide-adjuvant combinations on honey bee signal perception, we performed electroantennography assays to assess alterations in their olfactory responsiveness to the brood ester pheromone (BEP), the volatile larval pheromone β-ocimene, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. These assays aimed to uncover potential mechanisms underlying changes in social behaviors and reduced brood survival after pesticide exposure. We found that combining the adjuvant Dyne-Amic with the fungicide Tilt (propiconazole) and the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole) synergistically enhanced olfactory responses to three concentrations of BEP and as well exerted dampening and compensatory effects on responses to 2-heptanone and β-ocimene, respectively. In contrast, exposure to adjuvant alone or the combination of fungicide and insecticide had no effect on olfactory responses to BEP at most concentrations but altered responses to β-ocimene and 2-heptanone. Exposure to Dyne-Amic, Altacor, and Tilt increased BEP signal amplitude, indicating potential changes in olfactory receptor sensitivity or sensilla permeability to odorants. Given that, in a previous study, next-generation queens raised by nurses exposed to the same treated pollen experienced reduced survival, these new findings highlight the potential disruption of social signaling in honey bees and its implications for colony reproductive success. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited."
Donley N.; Cox C.; Bennett K.; Temkin A.M.; Andrews D.Q.; Naidenko O.V.,Forever Pesticides: A Growing Source of PFAS Contamination in the Environment,2024,Environmental Health Perspectives,132,,,10.1289/EHP13954,"BACKGROUND: Environmental contamination by fluorinated chemicals, in particular chemicals from the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) class, has raised concerns around the globe because of documented adverse impacts on human health, wildlife, and ecosystem quality. Recent studies have indicated that pesticide products may contain a variety of chemicals that meet the PFAS definition, including the active pesticide ingredients themselves. Given that pesticides are some of the most widely distributed pollutants across the world, the legacy impacts of PFAS addition into pesticide products could be widespread and have wide-ranging implications on agriculture and food and water contamination, as well as the presence of PFAS in rural environments. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to explore different ways that PFAS can be introduced into pesticide products, the extent of PFAS contamination of pesticide products, and the implications this could have for human and environmental health. METHODS: We submitted multiple public records requests to state and federal agencies in the United States and Canada and extracted relevant data from those records. We also compiled data from publicly accessible databases for our analyses. DISCUSSION: We found that the biggest contributor to PFAS in pesticide products was active ingredients and their degradates. Nearly a quarter of all US conventional pesticide active ingredients were organofluorines and 14% were PFAS, and for active ingredients approved in the last 10 y, this had increased to 61% organofluorines and 30% PFAS. Another major contributing source was through PFAS leaching from fluorinated containers into pesticide products. Fluorination of adjuvant products and “inert” ingredients appeared to be limited, although this represents a major knowledge gap. We explored aspects of immunotoxicity, persistence, water contamination, and total fluorine load in the environment and conclude that the recent trend of using fluorinated active ingredients in pesticides may be having effects on chemical toxicity and persistence that are not given adequate oversight in the United States. We recommend a more stringent risk assessment approach for fluorinated pesticides, transparent disclosure of “inert” ingredients on pesticide labels, a complete phase-out of post-mold fluorination of plastic containers, and greater monitoring in the United States. © 2024, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This herbicide can impact the mosquito life cycle through being carried to mosquito habitats by runoff. This study investigates the effects of glyphosate on the larval development and oviposition of a laboratory colony of Culex quinquefasciatus. Our experiments indicated that a concentration of 1 g/liter glyphosate was lethal to larval instars or the larvae impacted were either unable to molt to pupae or never emerged as adults. Larval instars exposed to 0.5 g/liter glyphosate experienced a similar impact; however, the larval stage was extended and pupation was considerably delayed. Mosquitoes oviposited in 0.5 g/liter glyphosate laid the same number of egg rafts as in water, but a considerably lower number of eggs exposed to glyphosate hatched as first instars. If gravid females laid their eggs in 1 g/liter glyphosate versus water, the difference between the 2 groups would be statistically significant and a very low number of eggs exposed to glyphosate could ever hatch into larvae. In an oviposition assay carried out in a cage with 3 choices of water, 0.5 g/liter, and 1 g/liter glyphosate, a higher number of egg rafts were laid in water, followed by 0.5 g/liter and 1 g/liter glyphosate concentrations, respectively. Our study indicated such a severe effect of glyphosate on all immature stages of Cx. quinquefasciatus that no adult could ever emerge.

We evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of analytical standards and commercial formulations of atrazine (2 µg L−1) and glyphosate (65 µg L−1), isolated and in mixture (2 + 65 µg L−1) on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna. Through chronic exposure (21 days) of two generations, we observed effects on survival, reproductive capacity and responses of the antioxidant defense system (catalase) and biotransformation system (glutathione S-transferase). The survival of organisms was affected in the second generation (F1) with a mortality of 17% in the mixture of commercial formulations treatments. In the evaluation of the first generation (F0) we observed only effects on sexual maturation of organisms, while in the F1, changes were observed in all parameters evaluated. A statistical difference (p < 0.05) was also observed between the analytical standards and the commercial formulations for all parameters evaluated, indicating that other components present in the formulations can change the toxicity of products. We suggest that atrazine can modulate toxicity when mixed with glyphosate, as the standard analytical atrazine and mixture of analytical standards results were similar in most parameters. Given the difficulty in estimating effects of mixtures and considering that various stressors are found in the environment, our results support the need to carry out long-term studies and, above all, to verify what are the impacts across generations, so that the toxicity of products is not underestimated.

Owing to its widespread use, fipronil and its metabolites (fipronil sulfone, fipronil desulfinyl, and fipronil sulfide), termed FPM, can be frequently detected in drinking water and food. Fipronil can affect the thyroid function of animals, but the effects of FPM on the human thyroid remain unclear. We employed human thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3-1 cells to examine combined cytotoxic responses, thyroid-related functional proteins including the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), deiodinases I-III (DIO I-III), and the nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway induced by FPM of 1-1000-fold concentrations detected in school drinking water collected from a heavily contaminated area of the Huai River Basin. Thyroid-disrupting effects of FPM were evaluated by examining biomarkers of oxidative stress and thyroid function and tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels secreted by Nthy-ori 3-1 cells after FPM treatment. FPM activated the expression of NRF2, HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1), TPO, DIO I, and DIO II but inhibited NIS expression and increased the T4 level of thyrocytes, indicating that FPM can disrupt the function of human thyrocytes through oxidative pathways. Given the adverse impact of low FPM concentrations on human thyrocytes, supportive evidence from rodent studies, and the critical importance of thyroid hormones on development, the effects of FPM on the neurodevelopment and growth of children warrant priority attention. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Two formulation agents of toxicological concern, Naphthalene and Solvent Naphtha (Petroleum), Heavy Aromatic, were simulated from their usage in commercially-applied pesticides. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate these formulation agents during 2011–2014 in the agriculturally intensive Sacramento River watershed. The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26–31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level. Since many formulation agents are widely used in pesticides throughout this and other agriculturally impacted watersheds, their potential risks in the environment need more thorough investigation by modeling and monitoring, especially for areas with heavy usage. © 2022"

The efficacy was evaluated from the experimental plots at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment. Our results indicated that the adjuvant was able to enhance the efficacy of both methoxyfenozide and spinosad against L. botrana at each interval. The increased efficacy was due to the lower values of surface tension and to the improved contact angle parameters of the spray solutions. By adding adjuvant in the spraying liquid, it was possible to have a control efficiency very similar to the treatment using the recommended rates, even when the application rate was reduced by 20%. Our results underline the importance of adjuvants in improving the field efficacy of insecticides against L. botrana. © 2022 European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization."
Straw E.A.,End co-formulant secrecy,2024,Environmental Science and Policy,154,,,10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103701,"Pesticides, widely used in modern agriculture, are applied in formulations that contain the main ingredient (active ingredient) and additional chemicals like solvents and surfactants (co-formulants). Both active ingredients and co-formulants can cause human and environmental toxicity. However, under European Union and United States law, the full details of the co-formulant composition are kept secret from the public and researchers. Only the producer and regulators know the full details. Here I argue that legislators should end ‘co-formulant secrecy’ and require all the ingredients in a pesticide be listed openly, including their concentrations. To this end I draw parallels between the legislation for pesticides with that of medicines, review the counterarguments, and discuss the impacts on research and regulation. Co-formulants can be toxicologically relevant, and some are even more toxic than the active ingredient in the formulation. Pesticide users, consumers and scientists deserve to have transparency in understanding what co-formulants are included in pesticide formulations. The stated rationale for secrecy is to protect innovation and reward companies for undertaking expensive research and development. However, secrecy is ineffective at protecting innovation, as it is possible to reverse engineer a formulation's composition. Further, patents are already utilised, so secrecy adds no additional benefit to industry. I argue that co-formulant secrecy only serves to stifle and limit the ability of independent scientists to conduct research. © 2024 The Authors"

This lack of exposure specificity could lead to results that fail to detect an association. It could be related to the lack of consensus on exposure assessment methods and the choice of exposure determinants. We conducted a meta-analysis following the PRISMA checklist to identify PPP exposure determinants used in occupational studies and identified exposure determinants that best characterized agricultural exposures to PPPs. Out of 1436 studies identified, 71 were included. The exposure determinants identified were active ingredients, chemical classes, types of PPP, crops, tasks, frequencies, duration, lifetime exposure days, and intensity-weighted exposure days. Only six over 17 associations between exposure determinants and health outcomes were found with moderate quality of evidence. Overall, epidemiological studies had difficulty defining relevant determinants to characterize PPP exposures for agricultural workers. We recommend that a standardized list of determinants for PPP exposures in occupational exposure studies should include information on formulations, intensity, duration, and frequency of PPP exposure. Harmonized data collection on exposure and health outcomes are required as well as standard units for each exposure determinant. © 2023 by the authors."

Chemicals used for pest control in agriculture and aquaculture may accumulate in natural coastal environments. Pyrethroids are common pesticides that are used on crops as well as applied to aquaculture pens and then may disperse in the surrounding ocean once treatment is complete. This study observed the sublethal effects of two pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin (within commercially available formulations), on post-larval stage IV American lobster (Homarus americanus) using growth parameters and metabolic rate as indicators. Observed effects on growth parameters were a decrease in size increment and specific growth rate as well as an increase in intermolt period in stage IV lobsters exposed to 100 μg/kg permethrin. No significant differences were found for intermolt period, size increment, or specific growth rate in deltamethrin-exposed stage IV lobsters. Metabolic rates were not significantly different between deltamethrin-exposed and control lobsters, however, this sublethal effect warrants further investigation. Collectively, these results represent the first examination of the sublethal effects of exposure to pyrethroids formulations in post-larval lobsters, highlighting the potential for effects on non-target marine organisms.

Static bioassays were performed in the laboratory to compare the acute toxicity between the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to four freshwater organisms: the crustacean zooplankton Cyclops viridis, the oligochaete worm Branchiura sowerbyi, the gastropod Pila globosa, and tadpole larvae of Duttaphrynus melanostictus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations in water after 2 h of exposure to the nominal concentrations ranged from 82.98% to 88.56%. The commercial formulation (F) of chlorpyrifos was found to be 1.94 to 2.76 times more toxic than the technical grade (T). Based on 96 h LC50 values of T and F chlorpyrifos, C. viridis was found to be most sensitive (0.56 and 0.25 μg/L) and P. globosa as most tolerant (1482 and 536 μg/L) to chlorpyrifos. Changes in LC50 values of both T and F chlorpyrifos were noted in respect of exposure hours for the three aquatic invertebrates and the tadpole larvae of the toad. In conclusion, the acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos to some non-target freshwater organisms differs between technical grade and commercial formulations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Obtaining information regarding the fate of this a.i. in environmental matrices and its ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms is essential for the risk assessment of the herbicide. In this study, the effects of Merlin Flexx- and Merlin WG75 formulated isoxaflutole-based herbicide products and two selected additives (cyprosulfamide safener and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one antimicrobial agent) were investigated on Raphidocelis subcapitata in growth inhibition assays. In ecotoxicological tests, two conventional (optical density and chlorophyll-a content) and two induced fluorescence-based (Fv*/Fp: efficiency of the photosystem PSII and Rfd* changes in the observed ratio of fluorescence decrease) endpoints were determined by UV-spectrophotometer and by our FluoroMeter Module, respectively. Furthermore, dissipation of isoxaflutole alone and in its formulated products was examined by an HPLC-UV method. In ecotoxicological assays, the fluorescence-based Rfd* was observed as the most sensitive endpoint. In this study, the effects of the safener cyprosulfamide and the antimicrobial agent 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one on R. subcapitata is firstly reported. The results indicated that the isoxaflutole-equivalent toxicity of the mixture of the isoxaflutole–safener–antimicrobial agent triggered lower toxicity (EC50 = 2.81 ± 0.22 mg/L) compared to the individual effect of the a.i. (EC50 = 0.02 ± 0.00 mg/L). The Merlin Flexx formulation (EC50 = 27.04 ± 1.41 mg/L) was found to be approximately 50-fold less toxic than Merlin WG75, which can be explained by the different chemical characteristics and quantity of additives in them. The additives influenced the dissipation of the a.i. in Z8 medium, as the DT50 value decreased by approximately 1.2- and 3.5-fold under light and dark conditions, respectively. © 2024 by the authors."

To investigate these effects while considering plant competition, we conducted a completely randomised pot experiment. We grew four temperate grassland species – Achillea ptarmica, Agrostis capillaris, Dianthus deltoides, and Plantago lanceolata – separately in pots, with soil treated with formulated moxidectin at three concentration levels (0.1, 1, 5 μg g−1) or left untreated (control). In half of the pots, we added the dominant grass species Poa pratensis as a competitor. Over a full growth period in a greenhouse, we measured three morphological traits: above-ground plant biomass (APB), specific leaf area (SLA), and intact leaf area (ILA). Moxidectin concentrations in the above-ground plant parts and soil were analysed using HPLC. Results showed that moxidectin was absorbed by the roots and transported to the above-ground plant parts. At the highest concentration (5 μg g−1), APB and ILA were reduced by 14.4 % and 19.8 %, respectively, compared to controls, while SLA increased by 12.2 %. Anthelmintic effects varied with competition; for APB, significant effects were noted only in the absence of competition for three out of four species. The highest increases in SLA and reductions in ILA at 5 μg g−1 occurred without competition in one and three species, respectively. These findings suggest that soil contamination by anthelmintic residues can negatively affect the growth and fitness of grassland plants, particularly in low-competition areas, such as open soil patches, which serve as protective microsites for plant recruitment. © 2025 The Authors"

Dicamba easily migrates to deep soil, which is anoxic; however, the anaerobic catabolism of dicamba in paddy soil is still unknown. In this study, an anaerobic dicamba-degrading consortium was enriched from deep paddy soil. The consortium completely degraded 0.83 mM dicamba within 7 days. Five metabolites were identified, one of which is a new metabolite, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and a novel anaerobic dicamba degradation pathway was proposed. 2.5 mM dicamba, 1.5-2.0% NaCl, and 20 mM electron acceptors Na2SO4, NaNO3, and FeCl3, and 0.5 mM or more of metabolites 3-CP and 2,5-DCP strongly inhibited the degradation efficiency. During enrichment, the microbial community of the consortium was significantly changed with OTU numbers, and diversity decreased. The study is valuable to elucidate the catabolism and ecotoxicology studies of dicamba in paddy soil and to facilitate the engineering application of anaerobic technology to treat dicamba-manufacturing wastewater. © 2024 American Chemical Society"

These regulations are among the most stringent in the world, however they have been the subject of criticisms especially because of the decline in biodiversity. The objectives of this work were to review (1) the functioning and actors involved in the PPP framework processes, (2) the construction of the environmental risk assessment focused on biodiversity, and (3) the suggested ways to respond to the identified limits. Both literature from social sciences and ecotoxicology were examined. Despite the protective nature of the European regulation on PPPs, the very imperfect consideration of biodiversity in the evaluation process was underlined. The main limits are the multiplicity of applicable rules, the routinization of the evaluation procedures, the lack of consideration of social data, and the lack of independence of the evaluation. Strengths of the regulation are the decision to integrate a systemic approach in the evaluation of PPPs, the development of modeling tools, and the phytopharmacovigilance systems. The avenues for improvement concern the realism of the risk assessment (species used, cocktail effects…), a greater transparency and independence in the conduct of evaluations, and the opening of the evaluation and decision-making processes to actors such as beekeepers or NGOs. Truly interdisciplinary reflections crossing the functioning of the living world, its alteration by PPPs, and how these elements question the users of PPPs would allow to specify social actions, public policies, and their regulation to better protect biodiversity.

Pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems represents a threat to non-target organisms, with various damages already reported in different species. However, there is controversy in studies on atrazine. The question of whether atrazine increases animal mortality is not yet clearly resolved. In this context, this study aimed to carry out a meta-analytic review, focusing on studies on environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine to evaluate its lethal effects on various animal species. We identified and analyzed 107 datasets through a selection process that used the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) databases. A significant increase in the mortality rate of animals exposed to environmental concentrations of atrazine was observed. Nematodes, amphibians, molluscs, insects, and fish showed increased mortality after exposure to atrazine. Animals in the larval and juvenile stages showed greater susceptibility when exposed to different concentrations of atrazine. Furthermore, both commercial and pure formulations resulted in high mortality rates for exposed animals. Atrazine and other pesticides had a synergistic effect, increasing the risk of mortality in animals. There are still many gaps to be filled, and this study can serve as a basis for future regulations involving atrazine. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

In the laboratory, static bioassays were undertaken to examine differences in acute toxicity caused by exposure to the technical grade (94% a.i.) and an emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to two species of freshwater fish, Labeo rohita and Mystus vittatus. The recovery of actual chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from 83% (technical grade, T) to 89% (emulsifiable concentrate, F) after two hours in water. The susceptibilities of the two fish species to the two types of chlorpyrifos varied. The 96-h LC50 values for T and F chlorpyrifos in L. rohita were 68 and 36 µg/L, respectively, and 120 and 62 µg/L in M. vittatus, respectively. As the exposure period was extended, the LC50 values gradually decreased. LC50 values between the technical grade and formulation were compared following the criteria of Mayer et al. (1986), Schmuck et al. (1994), APHA (1995), and Demetrio et al. (2014). It was concluded from the study that the emulsifiable concentrate (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos was more toxic than technical-grade chlorpyrifos. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."
DesJardins N.S.; Macias J.; Soto Soto D.; Harrison J.F.; Smith B.H.,‘Inert’ co-formulants of a fungicide mediate acute effects on honey bee learning performance,2023,Scientific Reports,13,,,10.1038/s41598-023-46948-6,"Managed honey bees have experienced high rates of colony loss recently, with pesticide exposure as a major cause. While pesticides can be lethal at high doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade secret “other ingredients” in the formulation mediated the learning effects, either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing pesticide risks. © 2023, The Author(s)."

This study aimed to evaluate the sublethal effects of different concentrations of atrazine-based herbicide (ABH) and glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) commercial formulations, both individually and in a mixture, through toxicity tests on the larval stage of Boana faber. Tadpoles were exposed to concentrations of ABH (2, 9.33, 10.40, 47.21, and 240 μg L−1) and GBH (65, 144, 280, 500, and 1000 μg L−1), as well as a mixture ABH + GBH, for 7 days. Although survival and swimming activity were not significantly affected by herbicide exposure, tadpoles in all treatments showed damage to the mouth and intestine, changes in size and mass, and an increase in the frequency of micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities. Despite differences in some variables analyzed, it is not possible to definitively state that there is a difference in the toxicity of these two herbicides, as both caused morphological damage and were cyto-genotoxic. Our findings suggest that exposure to commercial formulations of these herbicides, whether alone or in mixture, can directly impact the quality of life of B. faber tadpoles. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) the effects of the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, on the freshwater copepod Notodiaptomus iheringi; and (ii) the survival and the feeding rate of copepods after the exposure. Acute toxicity tests using the commercial formulations of fipronil and 2,4-D, individually and in mixture, were performed. The LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h of fipronil to N. iheringi were 2.38 ± 0.48, 3.08 ± 1.14, and 4.97 ± 3.30 μg L−1, respectively. For 2,4-D the LC10–48h, LC20–48h, and LC50–48h were 371.18 ± 29.20, 406.93 ± 53.77, and 478.24 ± 107.77 mg L−1, respectively. Morphological damages on the copepods exposed to pesticides were observed at all concentrations. Fungal filaments covering dead organisms were presented at the treatment highest concentration (R5:7.43 ± 2.78 μg L−1 fipronil). The mixture of the pesticides presented synergistic effects on the mortality of N. iheringi. Post-exposure tests showed no difference between the treatments and the control on the mortality and on the feeding rate for 4 h. However, since delayed toxicity of pesticides can occur, longer post-exposure tests using N. iheringi should be tested. N. iheringi is a key species in the aquatic Brazilian ecosystem and showed sensitivity to fipronil and 2,4-D; thus, more studies with this species assessing other responses are recommended. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Despite their perceived safety, there is increasing evidence that bioinsecticides can harm honey bees, which are crucial pollinators of many commercial crops and key ecotoxicological models. This short review aims to summarize key studies on exposure pathways and sublethal effects of bioinsecticides on honey bees, highlighting outdated risk assessment paradigms and critical evaluation issues. We discuss the need for novel approaches, such as molecular techniques and AI technologies, to better understand and mitigate the effects of bioinsecticides on honey bees.

A case study with Danio rerio,2023,Science of the Total Environment,900,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165706,"Paroxetine (PAR) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant increasingly detected in surface waters worldwide. Its environmental presence raises concerns about the potential detrimental effects on non-target organisms. Thus, this study aimed to increase knowledge on PAR's potential environmental impacts, assessing the effects of commercial formulation (PAR-c) and active ingredient (PAR-a) on fish. Therefore, the short-term exposure effects of PAR-c and PAR-a were assessed on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos/larvae to determine the most toxic formulation [through median lethal (LC50) and effective concentrations (EC50)]. PAR-c and PAR-a induced morphological abnormalities (scoliosis) in a dose-dependent manner from 96 hours post-fertilization onwards, suggesting the involvement of a fully functional biotransformation system. As PAR-c exhibited higher toxicity, it was selected to be tested in the subsequent stage (juvenile stage), which was more sensitive (lower LC50). PAR-c significantly decreased fish swimming activity and disrupted fish stress response. Overall, the results highlight the ability of PAR-c to adversely affect fish swimming performance, an effect that persisted even after exposure ceases (21-day depuration), suggesting that PAR-c may impair individual fitness. © 2023 The Authors"

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment. © 2023 by the authors."

They are emitted into the atmosphere via spraying and post-application volatilization, but their heterogeneous degradation kinetics toward OH radicals has not been well characterized. Therefore, the degradation rates of particle-associated PMM and PM with OH radicals were studied under different conditions including particle type, relatively humidity (RH), and temperature. The experimental results indicated that the degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on hydrophilic SiO2 particles were faster than those adsorbed on hydrophobic SiO2 particles, suggesting that heterogeneous kinetics was affected by surface properties of SiO2 particles. The degradation rates of PMM and PM adsorbed on these two kinds of SiO2 particles under experimental conditions ranged from (10.8 ± 0.7) × 10−12 and (6.1 ± 0.8) × 10−12 to (28.0 ± 1.7) × 10−12 and (13.5 ± 1.2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. Additionally, these rate constants showed a negative relationship with increasing RH level (20−80%) while a positive relationship with elevating temperature (5−35 °C). Arrhenius expressions for their heterogeneous degradation and the corresponding activation energies were calculated. According to the obtained degradation rates, the atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM toward OH radicals were in the ranges of 9.9–25.8 and 20.7−46.1 h, respectively, suggesting that OH-initiated heterogeneous degradation might be an important pathway during their atmospheric transformation processes. The experimental kinetic data obtained in this work are in favor of improving the understandings of atmospheric lifetimes of particle-associated PMM and PM, and also highlight that the environmental factors including particle type, RH, and temperature should be seriously taken into account for determining the atmospheric lifetimes of pesticides. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that “inert” ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure. This finding suggests that pesticides produce the inhibitory effect on enzymes through other mechanisms. © 2023 by the authors."

Despite their advantages in crop production and disease management, the use of pesticides poses significant hazards to the environment and public health. Pesticide elements have now perpetually entered our atmosphere and subsequently contaminated water, food, and soil, leading to health threats ranging from acute to chronic toxicities. Pesticides can cause acute toxicity if a high dose is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin or eyes, while prolonged or recurrent exposure to pesticides leads to chronic toxicity. Pesticides produce different types of toxicity, for instance, neurotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and endocrine disruption. The toxicity of a pesticide formulation may depend on the specific active ingredient and the presence of synergistic or inert compounds that can enhance or modify its toxicity. Safety concerns are the need of the hour to control contemporary pesticide-induced health hazards. The effectiveness and implementation of the current legislature in providing ample protection for human health and the environment are key concerns. This review explored a comprehensive summary of pesticides regarding their updated impacts on human health and advanced safety concerns with legislation. Implementing regulations, proper training, and education can help mitigate the negative impacts of pesticide use and promote safer and more sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors"

However, the complex preparation process, high cost, and potential environmental risk of nanocarriers severely restricted practical applications of carrier-based pesticide nanoformulations in agriculture. Herein, carrier-free self-assembled nanoparticles (FHA-PRO NPs) based on fenhexamid (FHA) and prochloraz (PRO) were developed by a facile co-assembly strategy to improve utilization efficiency and reduce toxicity to aquatic organism of pesticides. The results showed that noncovalent interactions between negatively charged FHA and positively charged PRO led to core-shell structured nanoparticles arranged in an orderly manner dispersing in aqueous solution with a diameter of 256 nm. The prepared FHA-PRO NPs showed a typical pH-responsive release profile and exhibited excellent physicochemical properties including low surface tension and high max retention. The photostability of FHA-PRO NPs was improved 2.4 times compared with free PRO. The FHA-PRO NPs displayed superior fungicidal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea and longer duration against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on potted rapeseed plants. Additionally, the FHA-PRO NPs reduced the acute toxicity of PRO to zebrafish significantly. Therefore, this work provided a promising strategy to develop nanoformulations of pesticides with stimuli-responsive controlled release characteristics for precise pesticide delivery. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The nanocapsule-based pesticide delivery systems combine the advantages of nanotechnology and advanced materials to achieve on-demand and accurately targeted release. Herein, a facile and universal strategy was used to fabricate photosensitive pesticide nanocapsules using a versatile imine polymer derived from cinnamaldehyde (CIN) and ε-poly-L-lysine (PLL). Characterization results demonstrated that the nanocapsules prepared under optimal conditions exhibited uniform sizes (200–400 nm) and high encapsulation efficiency (>90 %). Photodegradation experiments revealed a significant increase of half-lives (7.21–55.57 times) under UV irradiation for the different pesticide nanocapsules. Furthermore, the pesticide nanocapsules demonstrated a high biological activity and excellent physicochemical properties, including pH-responsive release, maximum retention, and rain erosion resistance. The results of the mechanistic studies on the increased biological activity indicated that the nanocapsules could be adsorbed on the surface of target pathogenic cells and then released CIN and PLL, destroying the integrity of the cell membrane, and synergistically and effectively eradicating the pathogen with pesticide. Additionally, nanocapsules exhibited lower toxicity to zebrafish and genetic toxicity to Vicia faba than pesticide technical. Therefore, stimuli-responsive nanocapsules based on imide polymer have broad application prospects in the field of pesticides. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Atrazine (ATZ) is a triazine herbicide widely used worldwide, and its ecotoxicity to soil microorganisms has been widely studied. However, previous studies have focused on investigating the ecotoxicity of ATZ active ingredients under laboratory conditions. The damage caused by ATZ formulations to soil health in the actual field environment cannot be ignored. Herein, the toxicity of ATZ formulations (1140 and 1710 g hm−2) in maize fields after 1, 28, and 72 d of exposure was investigated in terms of soil microbial abundance, community structure, soil enzyme activities, functional gene abundance, and ATZ residues. The results showed that ATZ disturbed the microbial functions that maintain soil health by disturbing soil nutrient and carbon cycling as well as enhancing pollution degradation. The promotion of both urease activity and AOB-amoA gene abundance indicated that ATZ accelerated the loss of nitrogen from soil, which was detrimental to soil nitrogen cycling. The abundances of the Pontibacter genus and the cbbLG gene were inhibited, indicating that the ability of soil carbon dioxide fixation was hindered. The abundance of Lysobacter, which helps to degrade pollutants, increased. The integrated biomarker response indicated that the comprehensive toxicity of ATZ to soil microorganisms increased with dose. Additionally, the DT50 of ATZ in agricultural soil was 5.4–5.7 d, and the residual level of ATZ in crop grains was in line with the maximum residue limit recommended by the European Union and China. The findings of the present study reflect the effects of ATZ formulation on soil microbes in the actual agricultural environment and provide insights into the mechanisms of soil health regulation mediated by microorganisms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

However, empirically measured pesticide dissipation half-lives are highly variable and the accurate prediction with models is challenging. This study utilized a dataset of pesticide dissipation half-lives containing 1363 datapoints, 311 pesticides, 10 plant types, and 4 plant component classes. Novel dissipation half-life intervals were proposed and predicted to account for high variations in empirical data. Four machine learning models (i.e., gradient boosting regression tree [GBRT], random forest [RF], supporting vector classifier [SVC], and logistic regression [LR]) were developed to predict dissipation half-life intervals using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), temperature, plant type, and plant component class as model inputs. GBRT-ECFP had the best model performance with F1-microbinary score of 0.698 ± 0.010 for the binary classification compared with other machine learning models (e.g., LR-ECFP, F1-microbinary= 0.662 ± 0.009). Feature importance analysis of molecular structures in the binary classification identified aromatic rings, carbonyl group, organophosphate, =C-H, and N-containing heterocyclic groups as important substructures related to pesticide dissipation half-lives. This study suggests the utility of machine learning models in assessing the environmental fate of pesticides in agricultural crops. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

In this context, the present study aims to raise awareness of the toxicological impact of pesticides on human health in pediatrics. For this purpose, the demographic characteristics, clinical assessment, and outcome of pediatric patients with acute pesticide poisoning admitted to the toxicology department of “Saint Mary” Emergency Children’s Hospital from Iasi, were analyzed. This retrospective study focused on the clinical and laboratory data of patients aged under 18 years diagnosed with acute pesticide poisoning between 2010–2020. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 10 package. A total of 49 patients presented with manifestations of acute pesticide poisoning, and the most common pesticide involved was diazinon. The most frequent exposure route was accidentally ingesting pesticide products (95%). The primary clinical manifestations were toxic encephalopathy, coma, depressive disorder, gastric disorders, and respiratory failure. Changes in the glycemic status, liver, and kidney damage were also present. Treatment included decontamination, administration of antidote, supportive care, and recommendations to be closely monitored to avoid a new incident. These results highlight the toxic potential of pesticides on human health and their biological consequences, which require an increase in consciousness of the precautions imposed on their use, especially when children are nearby. © 2022 by the authors."

To evaluate the adverse effects caused in adults of Danio rerio species exposed to the pesticides abamectin, difenoconazole, and their commercial formulations (Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC®), both isolated and in mixtures, biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in the gills of organisms exposed to sublethal concentrations. To this end, the activities of the enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), lipid hydroperoxide (LH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are indicative of oxidative stress, were measured after 48 h of exposure to the different pesticide treatments. The results showed a significant increase in EROD activity and MDA levels in the gills of fish exposed to the commercial formulation of abamectin. When the fish were exposed to difenoconazole and its commercial formulation, an increase in GST, GPx, and MDA levels and a decrease in GR activity were observed in the gills. Furthermore, the responses of the biomarkers were more pronounced in organisms exposed to mixtures of both active ingredients and commercial formulations. It is concluded that the commercial formulations Kraft 36EC® and Score 250EC® and their mixtures cause significant alterations in the detoxification metabolism of exposed organisms and induce oxidative stress in fish. © 2024"

Trunk injection of nematicides is currently the most preferred method of control. This study aimed to evaluate the potency of the commonly used formulations of abamectin against B. xylophilus. Twenty-one formulations of abamectin were evaluated by comparing their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials against B. xylophilus. Nematodes were treated with diluted formulation concentrations in multi-well culture plates. And, populations preexposed to pre-determined concentrations of the formulations were inoculated onto Botrytis cinerea culture, and in pine twig cuttings. Potency was contrastingly different among formulations, with LC95 of 0.00285 and 0.39462 mg/ml for the most, and the least potent formulation, respectively. Paralysis generally occurred at an application dose of 0.06 μg/ ml or higher, and formulations with high sublethal toxicities caused significant paralysis levels at the tested doses, albeit the variations. Nematode reproduction was evident at lower doses of 0.00053-0.0006 μg/ml both on Botrytis cinerea and pine twigs, with significant variations among formulations. Thus, the study highlighted the inconsistencies in the potency of similar product formulations with the same active ingredient concentration against the target organism, and the need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the additives used in formulations. © The Korean Society of Plant Pathology."

These pollutants can infiltrate the ecosystem and spread throughout the food chain. Because of the diversified sources and extensive human activities, estuaries are particularly susceptible to increased pollution levels. A thorough review on recent ECs (platinum group elements, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides, siloxanes, liquid crystal monomers, cationic surfactant, antibiotic resistance genes, and microplastics) in estuaries, including their incidence, detection levels, and toxic effects, was performed. The inclusion of studies from different regions highlights the global nature of this issue, with each location having its unique set of contaminants. The diverse range of contaminants detected in estuary samples worldwide underscores the intricacy of ECs. A significant drawback is the scarcity of research on the toxic mechanisms of ECs on estuarine organisms, the prospect of unidentified ECs, warrant research scopes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

When bioavailable, these chemicals pose a threat to living organisms and can induce oxidative stress (OS). In this article, attention is paid to OS and the physiological role of the antioxidant defense system. South African and international literature was reviewed to provide extensive evidence of pesticide-induced OS in non-target organisms, in vivo and in vitro. Although in vitro approaches are used internationally, South African studies have only used in vivo methods. Considering ethical implications, the authors support the use of in vitro bioassays to screen environmental matrices for their OS potential. Since OS responses are initiated and measurable at lower cellular concentrations compared to other toxicity endpoints, in vitro OS bioassays could be used as an early warning sign for the presence of chemical mixtures in non-target environments. Areas of concern in the country could be identified and prioritized without using animal models. The authors conclude that it will be worthwhile for South Africa to include in vitro OS bioassays as part of a battery of tests to screen environmental matrices for biological effects. This will facilitate the development and implementation of biomonitoring programs to safeguard the South African environment. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) bioassays were selected to test genotoxicity. Neutral red uptake (NRU), succinic dehydrogenase activity (MTT) and apoptogenic induction were employed for estimating cytotoxicity. Both compounds were analysed within a concentration range of 0.1–100 µg/mL. Only LCT produced a significant augment in the frequency of micronuclei (MNs) when the cultures were exposed to highest concentrations of 10 and 100 µg LCT/mL. A noticeable decrease in NDI was observed for cultures treated with LCT at 10 and 100 µg/mL. Karate® induced the inhibition of both the proportion of viable cells and succinic dehydrogenase activity and triggered apoptosis 24 h of exposition. Whilst an increased GDI in CHO-K1 cells was observed in the treatments with 1–100 µg Karate®/mL, the GDI was not modified in the treatments employing LCT at equivalent doses. SCGE showed that Karate® was more prone to induce genotoxic effects than LCT. Only 50 µg/mL of Karate® was able to increase apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the genomic instability and cytotoxic effects induced by this pyrethroid insecticide, confirming that LCT exposure can result in a severe drawback for the ecological equilibrium of the environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

Still, adverse environmental and human health effects resulting from its application have been reported. In this study, the possibility of readjusting the formulation of a commercial product combining azoxystrobin and tebuconazole (active ingredients – AIs; Custodia®) towards environmentally safer alternative(s) was investigated. Specifically, the sensitivity of non-target aquatic communities to each AI was first evaluated by applying the Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) approach. Then, mixtures of these AIs were tested in a non-target organism (Raphidocelis subcapitata) denoting sensitivity to both AIs as assessed from SSDs. The resulting data supported the design of the last stage of this study, where mixtures of those AIs at equivalent vs. alternative ratios and rates as in the commercial formulation were tested against two target fungal species: Pyrenophora teres CBS 123929 and Rhynchosporium secalis CBS 110524. The comparison between the sensitivity of non-target aquatic species and the corresponding efficacy towards target fungi revealed that currently applied mixture and rates of these AIs are generally environmentally safe (antagonistic interaction; concentrations below the EC1 for R. subcapitata and generally below the HC5 for aquatic non-target communities), but ineffective against target organisms (maximum levels of inhibition of 70 and 50% in P. teres CBS 123929 and R. secalis CBS 110524, respectively). Results additionally suggest a potentiation of the effects of the AIs by the other formulants added to the commercial product at tested rates. Overall, this study corroborates that commercial products can be optimized during design stages based on a systematic ecotoxicological testing for ingredient interactions and actual efficacy against targets. This could be a valuable pathway to reduce environmental contamination during transition to a more sustainable agricultural production. © 2023, The Author(s)."

FaPEx strategy comprising of two simple steps. Firstly, the sample was placed in the syringe and extracted using low-volume acetonitrile with NaCl and anhydrous MgSO4 salts. Secondly, the extractant was passed through in-syringe-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) kit containing cleanup sorbents and salt combinations (C18, primary secondary amine, and anhydrous MgSO4) for the cleanup process. Then, the obtained clean extractant was injected into LC-MS/MS for the quantification of target analytes. Various important parameters influencing the FaPEx performances, such as solvent type, salt type, salt amount, sorbent type, and amount, were examined and optimized. The method validation results showed excellent linearity with high correlation coefficients were ≥ 0.99. The estimated LODs were between 0.05–0.07 μg/kg, and LOQs ranged between 0.1–0.25 μg/kg for target analytes in both egg and soil sample matrices, and precision values were ≤7.90%. The developed method was applied to commercial chicken egg samples and environmental soil samples analysis. Spiked recoveries ranged between 88.75–110.91% for egg samples with RSDs ≤7.42% and 82.47–107.46% for soil samples with RSDs <7.37%. These results proved that the developed sample preparation method is a simple, fast, green, low-cost, and efficient method for the analysis of fipronil and its metabolites in food and environmental samples. Thus, this method can be applied as an alternative analytical methodology in routine and standard food and environmental testing laboratories. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

This study aimed to determine the ecotoxicity of individual pesticide formulations and their mixtures (insecticides and fungicides), which are applied during the production cycle of potato, according to agricultural practices from a Latin American region in Costa Rica. Two benchmark organisms were employed: Daphnia magna and Lactuca sativa. First, the evaluation of individual formulations (chlorothalonil, propineb, deltamethrin+imidacloprid, ziram, thiocyclam and chlorpyrifos) revealed differences between available EC50 for active ingredients (a.i.) and their respective formulations toward D. magna; on the contrary, no information could be retrieved from scientific literature for comparison in the case of L. sativa. In general, acute toxicity was higher toward D. magna than L. sativa. Moreover, interactions could not be determined on L. sativa, as the chlorothalonil formulation was not toxic at high levels and the concentration-response to propineb could not be fitted to obtain an IC50 value. The commercial formulation composed of deltamethrin+imidacloprid followed the concentration addition model (when compared with parameters retrieved from individual a.i.) and the other three mixtures evaluated (I: chlorothalonil-propineb-deltamethrin+imidacloprid; II: chlorothalonil-propineb-ziram-thiocyclam; III: chlorothalonil-propineb-chlorpyrifos) produced an antagonistic effect on D. magna, thus suggesting less acute toxicity than their individual components. Subsequent chronic studies showed that one of the most toxic mixtures (II) negatively affected D. magna reproduction at sublethal concentrations indicating that this mixture poses a risk to this species if these pesticides co-exist in freshwater systems. These findings provide useful data to better estimate the impact of real agricultural practices related to the use of agrochemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Herein, MSN loaded with indoxacarb (IN) were successfully prepared using the hard template method. Dopamine (DA) and α-cyclohexapentylose (α-CD) were encapsulated around the MSN surface to obtain pH and enzyme dual-response nanoparticles (IN@MSN@PDA@α-CD). The prepared nanoparticles showed a spherical core-shell structure with a loading content of 22.5 %, and the polymer coating covering the surface of the nanoparticles effectively protected IN from photolysis. Moreover, different biostimuli associated with Spodoptera frugiperda can trigger the release of IN from nanoparticles. Compared with the commercial emulsifiable concentrate (14.93 mg L−1), IN@MSN@PDA@α-CD (8.89 mg L−1) extended the effective duration of IN against Spodoptera frugiperda, and considerably decreased the toxicity of IN to Eisenia fetida, zebrafish and human BEAS-2B cells. Thus, pH/enzyme dual-responsive nanoparticles have substantial potential for sustainable on-demand targeted delivery of agrochemicals and for improving their environmental safety. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In the Republic of Korea, trunk injection of nematicides is the preferred method of control. In this study, the efficacy of 16 locally produced formulations of emamectin benzoate against the PWN are compared through determining their sublethal toxicities and reproduction inhibition potentials. Nematodes were treated with varying concentrations of the tested chemicals in multi-well culture plates, and rates of paralysis and mortality were determined after 24 h. Reproduction inhibition potential was tested by inoculating pre-treated nematodes onto Botrytis cinerea, and in pine twig cuttings. Despite the uniformity in the concentration of the active ingredient, efficacy was contrastingly different among formulations. The formulations evidently conformed to three distinct groups based on similarities in sublethal activity (group 1: LC95 of 0.00768-0.01443 mg/ ml; group 2: LC95 of 0.03202-0.07236 mg/ml, and group 3: LC95 of as high as 0.30643-0.40811 mg/ml). Nematode paralysis generally occurred at the application dose of 0.0134-0.1075 μg/ml, and there were significant differences in nematode paralysis rates among the products. Nematode reproduction was only evident at lower doses both on B. cinerea and pine twigs, albeit the variations among formulations. Group 1 formulations significantly reduced nematode reproduction even at a lower dose of 0.001075 µg/ml. The variations in efficacy might be attributed to differences in inert ingredients. Therefore, there is need to analyze the potential antagonistic effects of the large number of additives used in formulations. © 2023, Korean Society of Plant Pathology. All rights reserved."

Our aim was to estimate 48 h-LC50 and sub-chronic effects after the exposure to low concentrations of chlorpyrifos as commercial formulation (CF) and active ingredient (AI) on B. straminea adult, embryos and juveniles. Concentrations between 1 and 5000 μg L−1 were chosen for acute exposures and 0.1 and 1 μg L−1 for the sub-chronic one. After 14 days biochemical parameters, viability and sub-populations of hemocytes, reproductive parameters, embryotoxicity and offspring' survival were studied. Egg masses laid between day 12 and 14 were separated to continue the exposure and the embryos were examined daily. Offspring' survival and morphological changes were registered for 14 days after hatching. 48 h-LC50, NOEC and LOEC were similar between CF and AI, however the CF caused more sub-lethal effects. CF but not the AI decreased carboxylesterases, catalase and the proportion of hyalinocytes with respect to the total hemocytes, and increased superoxide dismutase and the % of granulocytes with pseudopods. Also CF caused embryotoxicity probably due to the increase of embryos' membrane permeability. Acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase, hemocytes sub-populations, the time and rate of hatching and juveniles' survival were the most sensitive biomarkers. We emphasize the importance of the assessment of a battery of biomarkers as a useful tool for toxicity studies including reproduction parameters and immunological responses. Also, we highlight the relevance of incorporating the evaluation of formulations in order to not underestimate the effects of pesticides on the environment. © 2023"

Despite this, there is a paucity of taxa-specific chemical effect data, in part due to the ethical and logistical constraints in working with highly mobile aquatic species. Advances in cetacean cell culture have opened the door to the application of mainstream in vitro toxicological effect assessment approaches. Image-based cell profiling is a high-throughput, microscopy-based system commonly applied in drug development. It permits the analysis of the xenobiotic effect on multiple cell organelles simultaneously, hereby flagging its potential utility in the evaluation of chemical toxicodynamics. Here we exposed immortalized humpback whale skin fibroblasts (HuWaTERT) to six priority environmental contaminants known to accumulate in the Southern Ocean food web, in order to explore their subcellular organelle responses.

The objective of this study was to assess respiratory symptoms associated with CPF exposure throughout the application season. Urine samples were collected from Egyptian adolescent applicators (n = 206) and non-applicators (n = 72) to assess 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), a biomarker for CPF exposure, along with spirometry measures to determine lung ventilatory function. Samples were collected over 7 months in 2016. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of reporting wheeze symptoms based on urinary TCPy concentrations while controlling for age and smoking in the household. Ordinal multinomial logistic regression was used to model the percent reference for forced expiratory volume in one second (rFEV1) based on urinary TCPy concentration (µg/g creatinine). Wheezing increased with increasing pesticide exposure (OR = 1.74 (1.32 − 2.31)). There was no statistically significant relationship between rFEV1 and TCPy concentration. Efforts to reduce pesticide exposure should be implemented to prevent the potential onset or exacerbation of any linked respiratory complications in adolescents. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

We measured biomarkers that included detoxification responses (glutathione S-transferase, GST), oxidative stress levels (lipid peroxidation, LPO, and catalase, CAT), DNA damage (comet assay), energy reserves (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and immune response (lysozyme activity, LYS). The absence of significant differences in catalase and lipid peroxidation levels suggested no oxidative stress due to fungicide exposure. However, the foliar fungicide Amistar®Xtra induced the highest GST activity and DNA fragmentation, suggesting synergistic effects between its active ingredients and undisclosed co-formulants. Similar effects observed with the Amistar®Xtra-Prosaro® mixture confirmed the greater toxicity of Amistar®Xtra. This study provides novel insights into the sub-lethal effects of single and combined commercial fungicides on a standard toxicity test organism, shedding light on the ecological implications of fungicide use in agroecosystems and reinforcing the need for pesticide reduction. © 2025 by the authors."

The antifungal capability of allicin and flavonoids varies depending on the target fungi; the combination of both compounds was expected to increase its antifungal activity. As a major disease of oil palm, basal stem rot (BSR) caused by Ganoderma boninense always be a top concern of oil palm farmers. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of combining allicin with hesperidin and rutin on antifungal activity against G. boninense through the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. The FIC index was determined using a checkerboard assay with media poisoning methods. The allicin concentration tested was 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8%, while the hesperidin and rutin concentrations were 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%. All combinations were done in triplicate and incubated for twelve days. The result showed that a combination of allicin with hesperidin or rutin was the additive interaction that lowers the concentration of each compound with similar inhibition rate of G. boninense in vitro. Combining allicin with rutin was considered better than hesperidin due to the higher inhibition rate of G. boninense. The allicin-rutin combination has a lower concentration with a 100% inhibition rate of G. boninense in vitro. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and mixture effects of fipronil, glyphosate and imidacloprid in human HepG2 cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated after 48-h incubations through MTT reduction and neutral red uptake assays. Free radicals production, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA damage, and release of liver enzymes were also evaluated. Data obtained for individual agents were used to compute the additivity expectations for two mixtures of definite composition (one equipotent mixture, based in the EC50 values achieved in the MTT assay; the other one based in the acceptable daily intake of each pesticide), using the models of concentration addition and independent action. The EC50 values for fipronil, glyphosate and imidacloprid were 37.59, 41.13, and 663.66 mg/L, respectively. The mixtures of pesticides elicited significant synergistic effects (p < 0.05), which were greater than the expected by both addictive predictions. Decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased in the transaminases enzymatic activities were observed. As they occur simultaneously, interactions between pesticides, even at non-effective single levels, can reverberate in significant deleterious effects, justifying the need for a more realistic approach in safety evaluations to better predict the effects to human health. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

Pesticides are one of the most recognised pollutants worldwide. Carbamates are a widely used pesticide family, and bendiocarb is a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide detected in surface and groundwater. In the present work, acute lethal and chronic effects of bendiocarb on the early life stages of freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis were investigated. 24-h LC50 of bendiocarb on L. stagnalis embryos and juveniles was estimated at 20.39 (18.30–22.71) mg/L and 38.35 (29.58–52.89) mg/L, respectively. Chronic tests were conducted for 21-d to evaluate the potential effects of the environmentally realistic concentrations of bendiocarb (5 and 100 µg/L) on the embryos. Mortality, development, growth (embryo: egg ratio and shell height), heart rate, and hatching success were investigated. The test results showed that mortality, developmental progression, embryo: egg ratio, shell height measurements and cumulative hatching rate were not significantly impaired by chronic bendiocarb exposure compared to the control. However, bendiocarb induced increased heart rate in the exposed snails. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Various genotoxicity assays were employed, revealing a higher level of DNA damage in exposed compared to non-exposed individuals. Farmers exposed to pesticides exhibited a significantly higher occurrence of chromosomal translocation (t(14;18)), micronuclei, and chromosomal aberrations. However, only two studies assessed cytotoxicity indirectly. The studies predominantly focused on male participants, with variations in sample size and pesticide types. The lack of detailed exposure data necessitates cautious interpretation.

The nanodelivery system showed the prolonged effectivity of EB with reduced degradation and demonstrated a good control efficacy for multiple target pests, such as red spider mite, beet armyworm larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and rice stem borers (Chilo suppressalis). Toxicology tests on various objects demonstrated that the EBWNS has low toxicity for seeds, HaCaT cells, zebrafish, earthworm, and E. coli. This study provides a distinctive perspective for developing environmentally friendly nanopesticide formulations, which clarified a water-based treatment method for specific lipid-soluble pesticides. The water-based nanodelivery pesticide system has the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of pesticides in the process of field applications. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

The prepared fenpropathrin nanoemulsion exhibited suitable stability and remarkable insecticidal activity against Helicoverpa armigera. The optimal formula in compliance with the standard of FAO was obtained. Fenpropathrin (10 wt%) and ethoxylated castor oil (EL-10: EL-40 = 2: 1, 9 wt%) were dissolved, mixed with hydrocarbon solvent (S-200, 8 wt%) and replenished with deionized water to obtain 100 wt%. The nanoemulsion droplets showed small contact angle and high adhesion work onto corn leaves, indicating that the nanoemulsions exhibited excellent wetting, adhesion and stretching capabilities. Compared with commercial emulsifiable concentrate (EC), the nanoemulsion had lower LC50 (50.01 mg L−1) against the third instar larva of Helicoverpa armigera. This was due to the body of larvae becoming completely darkened, shriveled and incapacitated shortly after treatment. The LC50 of the fenpropathrin nanoemulsion on Eisenia fetida was 96.60 and 47.99 mg kg−1 after 7 and 14 days, respectively. This indicated low toxicity to E. fetida. The L02 cell viability after 24 and 48 h of nanoemulsion treatment was 85.32 % and 68.95 %, respectively. In addition, the fenpropathrin nanoemulsion showed a lower apoptosis rate against L02 cells (8.52 %) than EC (63.18 %) after 24 h, indicating that the nanoemulsion had low cytotoxicity against L02 cells. In general, the utilization and environmental performance of pesticides were improved, with less cytotoxicity. This study will facilitate the preparation and application of nanoemulsions for lipophilic pesticide to enhance insecticidal activity, lower cytotoxicity and improve environmental compatibility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

They are highly water-soluble, persistent in soil, may enter the aquatic compartment via spray drift, runoff, or leaching, and contribute to downstream aquatic toxicity. Although insects appear to be the most sensitive group to neonicotinoids, other groups, such as crustaceans, may also be affected. Furthermore, most studies focus on single-insecticide exposure and very little is known concerning the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures on aquatic invertebrates. The present study was designed to test potential toxicological effects of an environmentally relevant mixture of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam on populations of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Daphnia magna under controlled conditions. Chronic toxicity tests were conducted in the laboratory, and survival and reproduction were measured for both species under environmentally relevant, ‘worst-case’ concentrations for each compound separately and in combination as pesticides are often detected as mixtures in aquatic environments. The neonicotinoids did not appear to affect the survival of C. dubia and D. magna. Reproduction of C. dubia was affected by the mixture whereas all three individual insecticides as well as the mixture caused a significant reduction in the reproduction of D. magna. Our results highlight the complexity of pesticide toxicity and show that traditional toxicological approaches such as, acute mortality studies and tests with single compounds can underestimate negative impacts that occur in the environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
Laber L.; Eichberg C.; Zimmerbeutel A.; Düring R.-A.; Donath T.W.,Effects of macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics on seed germination of temperate grassland species,2023,Plant Biology,25,1046,1057,10.1111/plb.13577,"Macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics are widely used to control invertebrate pests in livestock, such as sheep. While anthelmintic effects on non-target animals, such as dung-dwelling insects, are well studied, effects on seed germination are largely unknown. Seeds can come into contact with anthelmintics either during passage through the gastro-intestinal tract of grazing animals or when anthelmintics are excreted with their dung into the environment, which may result in changed germination patterns. We used four commonly applied macrocyclic lactones to assess their effects on germination: moxidectin, ivermectin, abamectin and doramectin as pure substances; moxidectin and ivermectin also in formulated form. We tested these pharmaceuticals on 17 different temperate grassland species from five plant families. Seeds were exposed to three concentrations of macrocyclic lactones (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg·l−1) under controlled conditions, and germination was assessed over a 6-week period. From these data, we calculated germination percentage, mean germination time and germination synchrony. Most of the tested species were significantly affected in germination percentage and/or mean germination time by at least one of the tested pharmaceuticals, with formulated moxidectin having the largest impact. In general, the effects found were species- and pharmaceutical-specific. While formulated substances generally reduced germination percentage and increased mean germination time, pure substances increased germination percentage. Synchrony showed less clear patterns in all pharmaceuticals. Although effect size and sign varied between species, our study shows that non-target effects of macrocyclic lactones commonly occur in terrestrial plants. This may impede successful seed exchange between habitats via sheep, and even translate into profound changes to grazed ecosystems. © 2023 The Authors.

While the survival rates were not affected, sublethal effects were evidenced after exposure. The most frequent deformities were fin damage and axial and thoracic damage. The mixture of active ingredients caused an increase in SOD and GST, differing from the treatment with the mixture of commercial formulations. The activity of AChE was significantly reduced following the treatment with the active ingredient atrazine and in the mixture of active ingredients. In general, herbicide mixtures were responsible for causing more toxic effects to R. quelen embryos. Therefore, these responses showed to be suitable biomarkers of herbicides’ exposure, in addition to generating more environmentally relevant baseline data for re-stablishing safety levels of these substances in aquatic bodies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
Munaron D.; Mérigot B.; Derolez V.; Tapie N.; Budzinski H.; Fiandrino A.,Evaluating pesticide mixture risks in French Mediterranean coastal lagoons waters,2023,Science of the Total Environment,867,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161303,"To assess the risk of pesticide mixtures in lagoon waters, this study adopted a multi-step approach using integrative passive samplers (POCIS) and concentration addition (CA) toxicological models. Two French Mediterranean lagoons (Thau and Or) were monitored for a range of 68 pesticides continuously over a period of a year (2015–16). The findings revealed mixtures of dissolved pesticides with varying composition and levels over the year. The Or site contained more pesticides than Thau site (37 vs 28 different substances), at higher concentrations (0.1–58.6 ng.L−1 at Or vs <0.1–9.9 at Thau) and with overall higher detection frequencies. All samples showed a potential chronic toxicity risk, depending on the composition and concentrations of co-occurring pesticides. In 74 % of the samples, this pesticide risk was driven by a few single substances (ametryn, atrazine, azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorotoluron, irgarol, diuron and metolachlor) and certain transformation products (e.g. DPMU and metolachlor OA/ESA). Individually, these were a threat for the three taxa studied (phytoplankton, crustaceans and fish). Yet even a drastic reduction of these drivers alone (up to 5 % of their current concentration) would not eliminate the toxicity risks in 56 % of the Or Lagoon samples, due to pesticide mixtures. The two CA-based approaches used to assess the combined effect of these mixtures, determined chronic potential negative impacts for both lagoons, while no acute risk was highlighted. This risk was seasonal, indicating the importance of monitoring in key periods (summer, winter and spring) to get a more realistic picture of the pesticide threat in lagoon waters. These findings suggest that it is crucial to review the current EU Water Framework Directive's risk-assessment method, as it may incorrectly determine pesticide risk in lagoons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

The spread of impermeable surfaces in urban coastal areas increases runoff, carrying pollutants that degrade surface water quality and impact the stress responses of coastal fauna. This study investigated oxidative stress and gonad health in male and female Callinectes amnicola (blue crabs) from urban and suburban regions of Lagos Lagoon. Gonadal damage in the crabs was linked to estrogenic metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) and antioxidant responses (MDA, GSH, GPx, CAT, and SOD). Urban male crabs showed higher oxidative stress, with elevated MDA and lower GSH and CAT levels, alongside regressive gonadal changes due to increased Pb, Cd, and Zn exposure. Suburban crabs, however, displayed more intersex conditions (ovotestes) correlated with elevated Cu levels in lagoon sediment. These results highlight severe testicular disruption in urban males and ovarian dysgerminomas in suburban females, indicating a sex-specific impact of pollution on reproductive health. The study identifies two primary reproductive toxicity risks: (1) male testicular damage and regressive lesions in urban crabs, caused by increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, and (2) female endocrine disruption, with ovotestes in suburban populations potentially leading to nonviable follicles. These findings emphasize that urban blue crabs face significant risks across both sexes, while suburban populations are more affected by female-specific risks. The study underscores the need for targeted environmental management to address the different stressors impacting these populations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."

In this study the impact of crop type (spring wheat and corn) and cultivation intensity on the community of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in the forest-steppe of Western Siberia was investigated. A total of 39 species from 15 genera were collected. Ground beetles' community was characterized by a high evenness of species distribution across the agroecosystems. The average Jaccard's similarity index for species presence/absence was 65%, and for abundance it was 54%. The significant difference in the distribution of predatory and mixophytophages ground beetles in wheat crops (U test, P < 0.05) can be justified by the constant suppression of the weed component and the use of insecticides that lead to the dominance of the predators. Fauna of wheat crops was more diverse than that in corn (Margalef index, U test, P < 0.05). No significant differences in biological diversity indexes, except for the Simpson dominance index (U test, P < 0.05, wheat), were found in ground beetle communities in crops at different levels of intensification. A certain differentiation of predatory species was caused by the selective occurrence of the litter-soil species, especially abundant in the row-crop. The specificity of the ground beetle community of corn crops may have been caused by repeated inter-row tillage, which influenced the increase in porosity and topsoil relief and contributed to the creation of favorable microclimatic conditions. In general, the applied level of agrotechnological intensification had no significant effect on the species composition and ecological structure of beetle communities in agrolandscapes. The use of bioindicators made it possible to assess the environmental sustainability of the agricultural environment and also creates the prerequisites for the development of ecologically directed correction of agrotechnological operations in agroecosystem management. © 2023"

Nanopesticide research, introduced relatively recently, is an emerging field that can be defined as application of nanotechnology for crop protection. Nanopesticides have been proven to be more effective in reducing pest populations and plant infestation levels than bulk chemical pesticides.Some of the advantages that nanopesticide formulations present are increased solubility of water-insoluble active ingredients, increased formulation stability, elimination of toxic organic solvents when compared to conventional pesticides, the ability to release active ingredients gradually, enhanced stability to prevent early degradation, increased mobility and higher pesticidal activity due to smaller particle size, and a larger surface area that may lengthen their shelf life. Furthermore, the nanopesticides we're interested in are synthesized using plant-based substances, making them promising alternatives to traditional pest control chemicals. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) play an important role in human nutrition due to their high nutritional value. However, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, harmful insect species and mites can limit and reduce their production. In the current paper, we present the framework on which plant based nanopesticide technology is based, as well as the various techniques for determining nanoparticle properties. We highlight the potential for several medicinal and aromatic plants from the Khenifra region in Morocco to be used in the synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles. We also reviewed the use of metal nanoparticles in crop protection, emphasizing the control of green bean’s pests and disease, while compiling numerous research that demonstrate their effectiveness. After comparing plant-based nanopesticides to chemical pesticides used to treat green beans in Morocco, it is clear that they have enormous potential for treating pests and diseases with fewer negative effects on the environment and human health. © Articles by the authors;."
Jaffar S.; Ahmad S.; Lu Y.,Contribution of insect gut microbiota and their associated enzymes in insect physiology and biodegradation of pesticides,2022,Frontiers in Microbiology,13,,,10.3389/fmicb.2022.979383,"Synthetic pesticides are extensively and injudiciously applied to control agriculture and household pests worldwide. Due to their high use, their toxic residues have enormously increased in the agroecosystem in the past several years. They have caused many severe threats to non-target organisms, including humans. Therefore, the complete removal of toxic compounds is gaining wide attention to protect the ecosystem and the diversity of living organisms. Several methods, such as physical, chemical and biological, are applied to degrade compounds, but as compared to other methods, biological methods are considered more efficient, fast, eco-friendly and less expensive. In particular, employing microbial species and their purified enzymes makes the degradation of toxic pollutants more accessible and converts them into non-toxic products by several metabolic pathways. The digestive tract of insects is usually known as a superior organ that provides a nutrient-rich environment to hundreds of microbial species that perform a pivotal role in various physiological and ecological functions. There is a direct relationship between pesticides and insect pests: pesticides reduce the growth of insect species and alter the phyla located in the gut microbiome. In comparison, the insect gut microbiota tries to degrade toxic compounds by changing their toxicity, increasing the production and regulation of a diverse range of enzymes. These enzymes breakdown into their derivatives, and microbial species utilize them as a sole source of carbon, sulfur and energy. The resistance of pesticides (carbamates, pyrethroids, organophosphates, organochlorines, and neonicotinoids) in insect species is developed by metabolic mechanisms, regulation of enzymes and the expression of various microbial detoxifying genes in insect guts. This review summarizes the toxic effects of agrochemicals on humans, animals, birds and beneficial arthropods. It explores the preferential role of insect gut microbial species in the degradation process and the resistance mechanism of several pesticides in insect species. Additionally, various metabolic pathways have been systematically discussed to better understand the degradation of xenobiotics by insect gut microbial species.

Nanoformulations of pesticides are being developed as potential alternatives due to their beneficial properties, including enhanced solubility, targeted delivery to the site of action, improved stability and efficacy and reduced non-target effects. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment is necessary for these emerging nanopesticides compared to existing formulations, aiming to ascertain whether their ""nano"" characteristics exacerbate toxicity for non-target organisms. This study investigated the toxicity of tebuconazole (TBZ) in different formulations, including nanoformulations (poly-ε-caprolactone [PCL] and nanostructured lipid carrier [NLC] loaded with TBZ), as well as a commercial formulation, on the reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in both aqueous and soil matrices. Additionally, the impact of the correspondent nanocarriers without TBZ on C. elegans was examined. In water, TBZ in the form of nano and commercial formulations exhibited higher toxicity on the nematodes' reproduction than the TBZ (a.s.) attributable to higher freely dissolved concentrations of TBZ, which resulted in a toxicity order, ranging from the most to the least toxic as follows: NLC-TBZ > PCL-TBZ > commercial formulation > TBZ (a.s.). For NLC-TBZ, the excess toxicity could be clearly explained by combined toxicity of TBZ (a.s.) and nanocarriers, with the effect addition of the separate single compounds matching the observed effects of the nanoformulation. For PCL-TBZ, effects were stronger than expected from the effect addition of TBZ (a.s.) and PCL nanocarriers, potentially due to enhanced bioavailability of encapsulated TBZ in the gut of the nematodes. In soil, NLC with and without loaded TBZ showed higher toxicity than other tested compounds, while PCL nanocarriers without TBZ did not exhibit negative effects on the reproduction of C. elegans. Microcosm experiment, where long-term effects on native soil nematode fauna were tested, confirmed that TBZ-nanoformulations act via combined toxic effects of TBZ and nanocarriers. These findings contribute valuable insights to understanding nanopesticides' ecotoxicity and underscore the need for harmonized regulatory assessments to evaluate these novel formulations adequately. © The Author(s) 2024."

Model application and evaluation,2023,Ecological Modelling,484,,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110472,"Some artificial ponds (APs) are designed to collect part of the agricultural water fluxes and dissipate pesticide contamination through a synergy of physicochemical processes. APs act as buffer zones and mitigate pesticide transfer of farm plots to natural water resources. As part of a two-paper series, this paper addresses the application and validation of the PESTIPOND model. PESTIPOND is a process-based model developed to predict pesticides' behavior and distribution in APs located in drained agricultural catchments. Paper I (Bahi et al., 2023a) describes the development and sensitivity analysis of the model. PESTIPOND was applied on the Rampillon AP to characterize the fate of seven different pesticides and five monitoring periods while considering the key transfer and transformation processes. The model was assessed through various methods against the observed data in simulating pesticide dynamics. The statistical and graphical evaluation of PESTIPOND reflected a good performance except for boscalid. The sensitivity analysis and application of the model evidenced that adsorption-desorption and biotransformation in the pond water are major processes behind pesticide dissipation. Hydrophobic and lowly mobile pesticides are more likely to be bio-transformed at the water-sediment interface. This work highlights the link between the hydraulic residential time (HRT), temperature, and APs' efficiency in minimizing pesticide transfer into the environment. The model predicted that the actual efficiency of the AP covering 0.15% of the drained catchment would double if the pond's surface area covered at least 1% of the catchment. Moreover, the model's predictions evidenced that a temperature rise of 10 °C will increase the dissipation of pesticides by only 8%. PESTIPOND provides key elements that are useful to design and manage ponds with optimal efficiency. Hence, these APs can be complementary solutions to pesticide use regulation to reduce the transfer of agricultural contamination into freshwater resources. © 2023"

However, there is still a lack of ecotoxicological studies using commercial formulations of insecticides containing active ingredients. The study aimed to evaluate the developmental toxicity of a commercial insecticide mixture (imidacloprid [IMI] + beta-cyfluthrin [β-CYF]). Mortality, hatching rate, spontaneous contraction, heartbeat, morphological changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), skeletal development, and locomotor behavior of zebrafish were analyzed. Embryos were exposed to imidacloprid (IMI) and β-cyfluthrin (β-CYF) in the following ratios: 0.001 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.000125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C1); 0.01 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.00125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C2); 0.1 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.0125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C3); 1.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 0.125 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C4); 10.0 mg IMI·L−1 + 1.25 mg β-CYF·L−1 (C5) for 144 h. The results showed a mortality of 50 % of organisms in the C5 concentration. Embryos exposed to C1 and C3 showed tachycardia and hatched early compared to the negative control, indicating cardiotoxic and embryotoxic effects. The two highest concentrations tested (C4 and C5) induced evident morphological changes (yolk sac and pericardial edema, and spine alterations), and skeletal toxicity (absence of cartilage and bone formation), along with decreased larval swimming behavior. Also, the formulated insecticide (C1) increased ROS levels in zebrafish larvae. Results showed that the formulated insecticide containing IMI and β-CYF induces several toxic effects on developing zebrafish, indicating its environmental risk to aquatic organisms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

This knowledge has prompted studies on its effects on non-target organisms, revealing significant alterations to liver structure and function. In this review, we evaluated the literature on the hepatotoxicity of 2,4-D, focusing on morphological damages, toxicity biomarkers and affected liver functions. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus and 83 articles were selected after curation. Among these studies, 72% used in vivo models and 30% used in vitro models. Additionally, 48% used the active ingredient, and 35% used commercial formulations in exposure experiments. The most affected biomarkers were related to a decrease in antioxidant capacity through alterations in the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and the levels of malondialdehyde. Changes in energy metabolism, lipids, liver function, and xenobiotic metabolism were also identified. Furthermore, studies about the effects of 2,4-D in mixtures with other pesticides were found, as well as hepatoprotection trials. The reviewed data indicate the essential role of reduction in antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in 2,4-D-induced hepatotoxicity. However, the mechanism of action of the herbicide is still not fully understood and further research in this area is necessary. © 2024 by the authors."

Cox C.; Zeiss M.,"Health, Pesticide Adjuvants, and Inert Ingredients: California Case Study Illustrates Need for Data Access",2022,Environmental Health Perspectives,130,,,10.1289/EHP10634,"BACKGROUND: Many pesticide products are mixtures of multiple chemicals. These include active ingredients intended to kill pests, and so-called inert ingredients intended to improve the physical characteristics of the product. In addition, shortly before applying a pesticide product, applicators often mix adjuvants into the sprayer tank. Adjuvants are products designed to improve the performance or physical properties of a pesticide spray mixture. Manufacturers may use a particular chemical compound both as an inert ingredient within pesticide products and as a component of adjuvant prod-ucts. Nonetheless, regulations dictate that data on use are publicly available only for the portion used in adjuvants. Adjuvants are exempt from federal registration, but are defined as pesticides in California. Based on that definition, California has identified α-(p-nonylphenyl)-ω-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) (APNOHO) as the most widely used pesticide in the state, applied to more than 10 million acres annually. That quantified use includes only agricultural acres treated with adjuvants containing APNOHO. Total APNOHO use is likely higher because manufacturers also use the chemical as an inert ingredient within pesticide products, although data on such use are shielded by regulation. OBJECTIVES: We use APNOHO as a case study to demonstrate that the use of adjuvants and inert ingredients is difficult to track because relevant information is not publicly available. We synthesize information that suggests widespread agricultural use of alkylphenol ethoxylates, such as APNOHO, may pose significant human and environmental health risks. We then make recommendations for future research and policy. METHODS: We used information from California’s pesticide use reporting system and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate use of APNOHO. We used U.S. EPA and European databases, as well as published research, to identify human and environmental health hazards of APNOHO. We focused on research showing that APNOHO is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. DISCUSSION: Within California, APNOHO is applied in more than 150 adjuvant products. Nationwide, it is used as an inert ingredient in at least 650 pesticide products. Exposure to APNOHO is associated with endocrine disruption, birth defects, and aquatic toxicity. We suggest that the case of APNOHO illustrates the larger problem of a lack of publicly available data on use and toxicity of many adjuvants and pesticide inert ingredients. We recommend that researchers and regulators include adjuvants and inert ingredients when evaluating pesticide hazards, including endocrine disruption. We also recommend regulatory requirements to identify all ingredients on product labels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P-MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using copper as the active ingredient, P-MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi-field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P-MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long-term impact on the environment. © 2024 The Authors.

Quantifying the associated health risk highlights the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into inhalation exposure assessments rather than using the total inhaled concentration of airborne pesticides. In this study, we measured the inhalation unit exposure (UE) of three typical pesticides (lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid) during application and post-application drift at the recommended application dosage. The UE values were found to be 1.74–424.37 ng/m3 and 0.07–1.40 ng/m3, respectively, with marked variation between different spraying nozzles and formulations. For the inhalation exposure assessment, an in vitro method was developed to determine the inhalation bioaccessibility of lambda-cyhalothrin, phoxim, and acetamiprid and its applicability was validated based on in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) analysis. Their conservative inhalation bioaccessibility values estimates were 46.09 %, 67.12 %, and 40.31 %, respectively. The calculated average daily dose values of the analyzed pesticides in both single and mixed formulations ranged from 8.03 × 10−8 to 4.35 × 10−5 mg/kg·day based on the bioaccessible UE, corresponding to 22.99–67.11 % of the total exposure. Collectively, these findings are of guiding significance for improving risk management in pesticide application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
Majumder R.,Effects of pesticides on fish: An overview of evolution of bioassays and cutting edge technologies,2025,Ecological Frontiers,45,286,294,10.1016/j.ecofro.2024.11.011,"There has been a vast modification in the formulation and combination of pesticides, and a huge number of new pesticides have entered the market in the recent past to protect crops from pests. Many of these pesticides enter ponds, rivers, and reservoirs through runoff from agricultural fields and raise concerns for fish and other aquatic organisms. The purpose of this review is to explore different approaches used to evaluate pesticide toxicity in fish, ranging from traditional to cutting-edge techniques, for a better understanding of the environmental implications of pesticide pollution. The present article highlights specific endpoints to consider, the role of pesticide formulation, interactions of pesticide mixtures, ambient hydrological and biological factors, and the use of biomarkers, among others. In modern aquatic toxicology, one reliable method for assessing fish health and stress responses is the analysis of multiple biomarkers in fish exposed to pesticides. A comprehensive approach is used to aggregate all the detected biomarker responses into a single “Integrated Biomarker Response” (IBR) stress score. There is a view that integrating multiple biomarker responses can improve the ecological relevance of biomarkers. Moreover, the analysis of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) is a helpful method to interpret the dose-response effects of toxicants. This review highlights significant advancements in recent ecotoxicological bioassays for evaluating pesticide-mediated toxicity in fish and also identifies areas in need of future research. © 2024 Ecological Society of China"

Therefore, we tested impacts of the commonly used antibiotics tetracycline and sulfamethazine, single and in mixture, on seed germination and seedling root growth of six typical species of temperate European grasslands (Carum carvi, Centaurea jacea, Galium mollugo, Plantago lanceolata, Silene latifolia, Dactylis glomerata). In standardised germination experiments, we assessed three germination variables (germination percentage, mean germination time, synchrony of germination) and one post-germination variable (seedling root length) under different environmentally realistic antibiotic concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg l−1 and a water control). While the germination variables were only irregularly and weakly affected by both antibiotics, seedling root length was strongly reduced by tetracycline, but not by sulfamethazine. Among the test species, D. glomerata was most sensitive to tetracycline with the average root length reduced up to 81 % in the 10 mg l−1 treatment. Its germination behaviour, however, was almost insensitive to the two antibiotics. Mixture effects were only shown in relation to the germination of single species, where the binary mixture produced effects but not the two single antibiotics or, conversely, effects of single antibiotics were lost in the mixture. These findings highlight the potential threat of plant regeneration from seed by veterinary antibiotics, particularly affecting early root growth and potentially influencing plant population growth in natural habitats. © 2024 The Authors"

Heavy metals are currently a significant problem in drinking water and other natural water bodies, including soil, which has an adverse impact on the environment as a whole. The heavy metal is highly poisonous, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic to humans as well as other animals. Multiple polluted sites, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, have been observed to co-occur with heavy metals and organo-pollutants. Pesticides and heavy metals can be degraded and removed concurrently from various metals and pesticide-contaminated matrixes due to microbial processes that include a variety of bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, as well as fungi. Numerous studies have examined the removal of heavy metals and organic-pollutants from different types of systems, but none of them have addressed the removal of these co-occurring heavy metals and organic pollutants and the use of microbes to do so. Therefore, the main focus of this review is on the recent developments in the concurrent microbial degradation of organo-pollutants and heavy metal removal. The limitations related to the simultaneous removal and degradation of heavy metals and organo-pollutant pollutants have also been taken into account. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH"

The toxicological status of honey bees can be influenced by a number of factors, including pesticides. While extensive research has focused on the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides on individual bees and colonies, it is important to recognise that fungicides and herbicides can also affect bees' health. Unfortunately, in the field, honey bees are exposed to mixtures of compounds rather than single substances. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a commercial fungicide and a commercial herbicide, both individually and in combination, on honey bees. Mortality assays, biomarkers and learning and memory tests were performed, and the results were integrated to assess the toxicological status of honey bees. Neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities), detoxification and metabolic processes (glutathione S-transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities), immune system function (lysozyme activity and haemocytes count) and genotoxicity biomarkers (Nuclear Abnormalities assay) were assessed. The fungicide Sakura® was found to activate detoxification enzymes and affect alkaline phosphatase activity. The herbicide Elegant 2FD and the combination of both pesticides showed neurotoxic effects and induced detoxification processes. Exposure to the herbicide/fungicide mixture impaired learning and memory in honey bees. This study represents a significant advance in understanding the toxicological effects of commonly used commercial pesticides in agriculture and contributes to the development of effective strategies to mitigate their adverse effects on non-target insects. © 2024 The Authors"

However, there is still a knowledge gap on the Npes environmental impacts. To support the safety of nano-enabled pesticides, the present study aimed at assessing the toxicity of the commercial Npe NUCOP-M and the active substance copper oxychloride, using the ecotoxicological soil model Enchytraeus crypticus and LUFA 2.2 soil. Bioassays were performed to assess various endpoints within short-to longer-term exposures: avoidance behaviour (2 d), hatching (13 d), survival, reproduction and organisms’ size (based on the standard OECD test (28 d), the OECD extension (56 d), and the Full Life Cycle test – FLCt (46 d)). Based on the standard OECD test and its extension, NUCOP-M had a similar level of toxicity as copper oxychloride without indications of increase in toxicity over time (28 versus 56 d). The shorter-term exposures (2 and 13 d) showed higher toxicity for copper oxychloride. The exposure from cocoon stage (FLCt) seemed to provide an adaptative advantage (reduced toxicity) to NUCOP-M. The differences might be related to a slower release of Cu2+ ions from NUCOP-M, which seems to account for the toxicity at longer-term. Based on the recommended application doses (ca. 1.72 mg NUCOP-M kg−1, i.e. 0.62 mg Cu kg−1 in the topsoil) there is no unacceptable risk of NUCOP-M on the enchytraeid population. © 2024 The Authors"

A key objective of industry is to deliver active ingredients (AIs) that have minimal off site migration and non-target activity. Nanoporous materials have received significant attention internationally for the efficient loading and controlled, targeted delivery of pesticides. This is largely made possible due to their textural features including high surface area, large pore-volume, and tunable pore size. Additionally, the easier manipulation of their surface chemistry and stability in different environments are added advantages. The unique features of these materials allow them to address the solubility of the active ingredients, their efficient loading onto the porous channels, and slow and controlled delivery over time. One of their major advantages is the wide range of materials that could be suitably designed via different approaches to either adsorb, encapsulate, or entrap the active ingredient. This review is a timely presentation of recent progress made in nanoporous materials and discusses critical aspects of pesticide formulation and delivery. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

It is necessary to remove it from environment using a cost-effective and eco-friendly method. The aims of this study were to isolate glyphosate-degrading bacteria and to optimize their degradative conditions required for bioremediation. Sixteen bacterial strains were isolated through enrichment and one strain, Rhodococcus soli G41, demonstrated a high removal rate of glyphosate than other strains. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize distinct environmental factors on glyphosate degradation of G41 strain. The optimal conditions for the maximum glyphosate degradation were found to have the NH4Cl concentration of 0.663% and glyphosate concentration of 0.115%, resulting in a maximum degradation of 42.7% after 7 days. Bioremediation analysis showed 47.1% and 40% of glyphosate in unsterile soil and sterile soil was removed by G41 strain after 14 days, respectively. The presence of soxB gene in G41 strain indicates that the glyphosate is degraded via the eco-friendly sarcosine pathway. The results indicated that G41 strain has the potential to serve as an in-situ candidate for bioremediation of glyphosate polluted environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In this study, the influence of the type, dosage of emulsifier, and emulsifying process on the formation and stability of nanoemulsion were investigated. On this basis, the optimal nanoemulsion formula loaded with pyriproxyfen was obtained. Pyriproxyfen (5%) and polyoxyethylene castor oil ether (6%; EL-20) were dissolved in hydrocarbon solvent (5%; S-100) with deionized water replenished to 100%. Compared with oil-in-water emulsion (EW) and emulsifiable concentrate (EC), the longest drying time ensured that the nanoemulsions had a more durable control effect. The pyriproxyfen-loaded nanoemulsions had a high pupation inhibition rate and 100% eclosion inhibition rate. In addition, at 7 and 14 days, the 50% lethal concentrations (LC50) of pyriproxyfen-loaded nanoemulsions to Eisenia fetida were 1450.63 and 804.19 mg/kg, respectively, indicating their low acute toxicity to earthworms and environmental friendliness. Moreover, the pyriproxyfen-loaded nanoemulsions showed a low apoptosis rate (5.29%), whose value was considerably lower than that of EW (29.51%) and EC (9.45%), indicating a low toxicity to human hepatocyte L02 cells. This research facilitated the design and fabrication of nanoemulsions for water-insoluble pesticides to enhance the insecticidal activity, lower the cytotoxicity, and reduce environmental pollution of such chemicals.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Additionally, in Lebanon, basic flaws exist at different levels of pesticide management cycle. In this study, through an extensive review of relevant literature regarding the pesticides impact on humans and environment in Lebanon and adopted policies in existing legislation, several gaps have been identified. Accordingly, recommendations to reduce pesticide risk through a combination of reforms at the policy level and its tools, particularly legislation, are proposed. In our opinion, the starting point is to adopt a minimum list of lower risk pesticides supported by a combination of: “prescriptions” based on a comprehensive registration and an effective implementation systems, a suitable IPM/ICM government-supported credit system, traceability systems of agricultural commodities and pesticides containers, Pesticide stock management system to reduce the quantity of obsolete pesticides, and containers recycling system. For a global sustainability of pesticides risk reduction, a binding global intervention fostered by the UN, based on human rights for safe food, is called upon to ban hazardous pesticides-except those of WHO class IV- trafficking in developing countries scoring low in an international official assessment of their pesticides lifecycle management. At the same time, global funds should support pesticides alternatives and the enhancement of the developing countries capacities for pesticides lifecycle management, which is a part of a larger global matrix in risk reduction. © 2020 The Authors; Policy, legislations, reforms, pesticides, prescription, developing countries, risk reduction; Agricultural Policy; Crop Protection; Chemical Pest Control; Environmental Assessment; Legislation © 2020 The Authors"

To overcome these problems, carvacrol can be loaded into nanoemulsions. In this study, carvacrol-loaded nanoemulsions (CNs) were formulated and characterized, and the most suitable emulsifier was selected. The optimized formula of CNs by Box-Behnken design was: carvacrol 5%, emulsifier (Tween-80) at 8% and the shearing time of 7 min. The antibacterial activity of this optimum formulation of CNs was evaluated by the measurement of inhibition zone diameter, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. The antibacterial mechanism of CNs was also studied by scanning electron microscopy, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and intracellular lysate leakage. CNs damaged the structure of bacterial cells and the permeability of bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the leakage of cellular contents from bacteria. Also, at the same concentration, CNs had a higher cell survival rate and less apoptosis compared with commercial carvacrol aqueous solution; therefore, CNs had a higher biological safety. The final formulation solved the volatility and instability of carvacrol during use, along with providing a new technology for preparing CNs with a long-term stability and good antibacterial activity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

This is also the case for the insecticide fipronil and the herbicide 2,4-D, which are widely used in many crops. This study aimed at evaluating the individual and mixture toxicity of these pesticides to the tropical amphipod Hyalella meinerti. To this end, acute toxicity tests (96 h) were conducted. Chronic bioassays (10 days) were also carried out, in which the body length and dry biomass were evaluated as endpoints. In addition, a complete factorial mixture chronic toxicity test was carried out. H. meinerti was sensitive to fipronil in the acute toxicity tests, with a LC50-96-h of 0.86 μg L−1 (95% CI 0.26–0.46), and no acute effects were observed after 2,4-D exposure even at the highest test concentration of 100 mg L−1. In the chronic toxicity tests, all tested concentrations of both pesticides decreased the growth of H. meinerti, in which losses on biomass reached 45% and 65% for 2,4-D and fipronil, respectively. The pesticide mixture indicated antagonism although it still significantly decreased the body growth. The results obtained indicate a high sensitivity of H. meinerti exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations, demonstrating that there are risks for the species in real field conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, the complicated fabrication process of nanosized carriers and their multi-step chemical modifications greatly restrict the practical applications of nanocarrier-based formulations. To address these issues, herein, self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) based on fungicide fenhexamid (FHA) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) were constructed by the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between FHA and PHMB in water solution without using carriers or adjuvants. The optimal temperature and mass ratio between FHA and PHMB for the formation of NPs were 60 °C and 10 : 7, respectively. Obtained spherical NPs with sizes of 50-250 nm were stable in neutral and acidic aqueous mediums and displayed desirable physicochemical properties (strong surface positive charges, low conductivity, high light stability, and good surface activity). Moreover, the combination of FHA and PHMB by the self-assembly of NPs had a synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity, and NPs exhibited higher activities againstPseudomonas syringaepv.lachrymans,Botrytis cinerea, andSclerotinia sclerotiorumthan FHA and PHMB. Furthermore, the results of the genotoxicity evaluation inVicia fabashowed that the prepared NPs did not further increase the cytotoxicity of FHA. Overall, the formation of co-self-assembly nanoparticles of FHA and PHMBviaa simple and green approach may be a novel avenue for sustainable plant disease management and provides inspiration to construct new nano-based pesticide formulations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021."

Few studies on the genotoxicity of subchronic oral exposure to nano pesticides have been published. Male albino rats have been randomly divided into 4 identical groups. Group (I) had received only corn oil and acted as a control group. Group (II) had been given 3.855 mg/kg BW deltamethrin. Group (III) obtained deltamethrin loaded silica Nps at a dose of 8.795 mg/kg BW. The group (IV) obtained deltamethrin loaded chitosan Nps at a dose of 30.44 mg/kg BW. All remedies were administered by oral gavage 5 days a week for one month. The deltamethrin group showed a highly significant elevation in chromosome aberrations. Also, the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes proved that deltamethrin had a stronger cytotoxic effect on the bone marrow cells than the CS/DM Nps and S/DM Nps groups. It was concluded that these innovative nanoformulations of DM were less toxic, which would lower health risks and boost application safety. © 2022. by the authors.

This high contamination level increases at the head of agricultural watersheds, where dilution capacities are low and transport from treated lands is direct. Ponds, numerous around headwater streams, could provide additional protection against pesticide pollution. Because of their long hydraulic residence time and large water volumes, they mitigate pesticide concentrations between upstream and downstream rivers. However, pesticide transformation products may also be responsible for the degradation of environments, owing to their presence at high concentrations and their persistence, but related data are scarce, particularly because of their high level of molecular diversity. We first reported on the state of water contamination in agricultural headwater streams, based on high frequency water sampling. Analysis of 67 molecules (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) showed pesticides and pesticide transformation product mixtures of up to 29 different compounds in one sample. Regardless of the sampling location, transformation products represented at least 50% of the detected compounds. Then, we demonstrated the capacity of a pond to reduce contaminant concentrations in downstream rivers for 90% of the detected compounds. Upstream from this pond, environmental quality or ecotoxicological standards were exceeded during sampling, with pesticide and transformation product sum concentrations of up to 27 μg/L. Downstream from the study pond, few exceedances were observed, with a maximum total concentration of 2.2 μg/L, reflecting significant water quality improvement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Even though its use is rapidly growing, it is not followed by an adequate flow of scientific evidence regarding its toxicity towards non-target organisms. We evaluated the potential of low doses of tembotrione to induce oxidative stress and cytogenetic damage in blood and brain cells of adult male Wistar rats. Parameters of lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels, activities of antioxidant enzymes and primary DNA damage were assessed following 28-day repeated oral exposure to doses comparable with the currently proposed health-based reference values. The results of the alkaline comet assay showed that such low doses of tembotrione have the potency to inflict primary DNA damage in both peripheral blood leukocytes and brain of treated rats, even with only slight changes in the oxidative biomarker levels. The DNA damage in blood and brain cells of Wistar rats significantly increased at all applied doses, suggesting that tembotrione genotoxicity is mainly a result of direct interaction with DNA while the induction of oxidative stress responses contributes to DNA instability in a lesser extent. The findings of the present study call for further research using other sensitive biomarkers of effect and different exposure scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Methomyl is a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide and acaricide that acts primarily in acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChE). Methomyl formulation 96 h-LC50 was determined through the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test (FET) and resulted in 1.2 g/L ± 0.04. Sublethal 6-day exposure was performed in six methomyl formulation concentrations (0.5; 1.0; 2.2; 4.8; 10.6; 23.3 mg/L) to evaluate developmental, physiological, morphological, behavioral, biochemical, and molecular endpoints of zebrafish early-development. Methomyl affected embryo hatching and larva morphology and behavior, especially in higher concentrations; resulting in smaller body and eyes size, failure in swimming bladder inflation, hypolocomotor activity, and concentration-dependent reduction of AChE activity; demonstrating methomyl strong acute toxicity and neurotoxic effect. © 2021"

For spray dilutions, dimethoate and omethoate did not reach breakthrough glove permeation rate (1 μg·cm−2·min−1) and no or little skin permeation was observed for up to 8 h, regardless of formulation. For exposure conditions involving highly concentrated products, significant differences in glove permeation were observed between different formulations of dimethoate (about 1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and of omethoate (184-fold, P < 0.001). In contrast, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed between formulations in terms of skin permeation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that co-ingredients play a critical role in glove barrier protection against undiluted organophosphate insecticides, whereas their influence on skin uptake was insignificant within the exposure time tested. This implies that dermal exposure risk may vary between handling different formulated products of the same active ingredient hence recommending a common glove material for different formulations of the same chemical without careful consideration of co-ingredients and their permeation properties may not necessarily be appropriate. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."

In our earlier in vivo studies in Sprague–Dawley rats we observed that exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, induced different toxic effects relating to sexual development, endocrine system, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiome. In the present work, we aimed to comparatively test in in vitro models the cytotoxicity of glycine and GBHs. Methods: We tested the cytotoxic effects of glycine, glyphosate, and its formulation Roundup Bioflow at different doses using MTT and Trypan Blue assays in human Caco2 and murine L929 cell lines. Results: Statistically significant dose-related cytotoxic effects were observed in MTT and Trypan Blue assays in murine (L929) and human (Caco2) cells treated with glyphosate or Roundup Bioflow. No cytotoxic effects were observed for glycine. In L929, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in both MTT and Trypan Blue assays. In Caco2, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in the MTT assays, while a comparable IC50 was observed for glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow in Trypan Blue assays. IC50 for glycine could not be estimated because of the lack of cytotoxic effects of the substance. Conclusion: Glyphosate and its formulation Roundup Bioflow, but not glycine, caused dose-related cytotoxic effects in in vitro human and murine models (Caco2 and L929). Our results showed that glycine and its analog glyphosate presented different cytotoxicity profiles. Glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow demonstrate cytotoxicity similar to other organophosphate pesticides (malathion, diazinon, and chlorpyriphos). © Copyright © 2021 Truzzi, Mandrioli, Gnudi, Scheepers, Silbergeld, Belpoggi and Dinelli."

In aquatic ecosystems, benthic organisms may be exposed to pesticides via contaminated water and sediment, leading to several potential cascading effects on the food web. The aim of this study was to assess the functional implications of environmental realistic concentrations of the herbicide 2,4-D and the insecticide fipronil (alone and in combination) to the native tropical chironomid Chironomus sancticaroli. These two pesticides are widely applied to different crops and have frequently been detected (together) in surface water bodies in Brazil and elsewhere. Commercial products containing fipronil (Regent® 800WG) and 2,4-D (DMA® 806BR) were evaluated in 8-day toxicity tests for their effects on larval survival, growth (body length and biomass), head capsule width, development, and mentum deformities. Fipronil decreased the larval survival at the highest test concentration and the effective concentrations (EC) after eight days of exposure were: EC10 = 0.48 µg L−1 (0.395–0.565), EC20 = 1.06 µg L−1 (0.607–1.513), and EC50 = 3.70 µg L−1 (1.664–5.736). All sublethal test concentrations of fipronil decreased the larval growth, causing reductions in biomass up to 72%. The two highest test concentrations of fipronil decreased the head capsule width and after exposure to 3.7 µg fipronil L−1, only half of the larvae reached the fourth instar. The incidence of deformities was increased by fipronil in a concentration dependent manner with an increase ranging from 23% to 75%. The highest test concentration of 2.4-D (426 µg L−1) decreased the head capsule width, but larval development was unaffected at all concentrations evaluated. In the mixture tests, antagonism was observed at lower fipronil concentrations and synergism at higher fipronil concentrations for growth. The incidence of deformities rose with increasing fipronil concentrations. The results showed that environmental realistic concentrations of fipronil may have serious ecological implications for C. sancticaroli populations and that a mixture with the herbicide 2,4-D can have synergistic effects, potentiating the risks to the aquatic ecosystem. © 2020 The Authors"

Straw E.A.; Brown M.J.F.,"No evidence of effects or interaction between the widely used herbicide, glyphosate, and a common parasite in bumble bees",2021,PeerJ,9,,,10.7717/peerj.12486,"Background. Glyphosate is the world’s most used pesticide and it is used without the mitigation measures that could reduce the exposure of pollinators to it. However, studies are starting to suggest negative impacts of this pesticide on bees, an essential group of pollinators. Accordingly, whether glyphosate, alone or alongside other stressors, is detrimental to bee health is a vital question. Bees are suffering declines across the globe, and pesticides, including glyphosate, have been suggested as being factors in these declines. Methods. Here we test, across a range of experimental paradigms, whether glyphosate impacts a wild bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris. In addition, we build upon existing work with honey bees testing glyphosate-parasite interactions by conducting fully crossed experiments with glyphosate and a common bumble bee trypanosome gut parasite, Crithidia bombi. We utilised regulatory acute toxicity testing protocols, modified to allow for exposure to multiple stressors. These protocols are expanded upon to test for effects on long term survival (20 days). Microcolony testing, using unmated workers, was employed to measure the impacts of either stressor on a proxy of reproductive success. This microcolony testing was conducted with both acute and chronic exposure to cover a range of exposure scenarios. Results. We found no effects of acute or chronic exposure to glyphosate, over a range of timespans post-exposure, on mortality or a range of sublethal metrics. We also found no interaction between glyphosate and Crithidia bombi in any metric, although there was conflicting evidence of increased parasite intensity after an acute exposure to glyphosate. In contrast to published literature, we found no direct impacts of this parasite on bee health. Our testing focussed on mortality and worker reproduction, so impacts of either or both of these stressors on other sublethal metrics could still exist. Conclusions. Our results expand the current knowledge on glyphosate by testing a previously untested species, Bombus terrestris, using acute exposure, and by incorporating a parasite never before tested alongside glyphosate. In conclusion our results find that glyphosate, as an active ingredient, is unlikely to be harmful to bumble bees either alone, or alongside Crithidia bombi. Copyright 2021 Straw and Brown"

Yet, other pertinent factors, such as the effects of glyphosate on fresh and ground water and ensuing effects on biodiversity, have received less attention as legitimate rationales for regulating the chemical. This underrepresentation prevents a wider policy discussion on the environmental and human health effects of the chemical and fails to disrupt assumptions of path-dependently continuing on agriculture's chemical treadmill. To avoid ad hoc post hoc chemical regulation, we assess four areas of chemical regulatory oversight in Europe with regard to glyphosate affecting water: (1) the undue emphasis on in laboratorio versus in situ testing; (2) assessing single chemicals (isolated glyphosate) versus admixtures (glyphosate plus surfactants and adjuvants) that are used in practice; (3) the tendency to downplay harms to nonhuman life; and (4) the lack of policy coherence in the existing regulatory framework. Focusing on European Union regulation of pesticide and water policy affecting aquatic environments, we conclude that issues of measurement and priority have become highly politicised in both science and policy, requiring preventative, precautionary frameworks utilising plural forms of measurement.  © The Author(s), 2020."

It targets the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which lacks in humans, suggesting to confer a low mammalian toxicity to G-based herbicides (GBHs). Despite this, the use of G is currently under intense debate. Many studies indicating its hazard and toxicity on non-target organisms are emerging, and associations between GBHs and immune-endocrine disturbances have been described. This review aims to investigate, based on recent epidemiological studies and studies performed in vitro and in vivo in animals, the possible association between GBHs and immune-endocrine alterations. Published data suggest that GBHs have endocrine disrupting potentiality targeting sex and thyroid hormones, although its relevance for humans will require further investigations. Evidence of immunotoxicity are limited compared to those on endocrine effects, but overall highlight possible noxious effects, including lung inflammation and rhinitis. An attractive hypothesis could be the one that connects microbiota dysbiosis with possible immune-endocrine outcomes. Indeed, several intestinal microorganisms express the enzyme EPSPS and, studies are emerging that highlight a possible G-induced dysbiosis. Considering the wide use of GBHs in agriculture, further studies investigating their noxious effects at levels relevant for human exposure should be performed. A critical analysis of emerging evidence of G toxicity is required to better characterize its safety profile. In addition, attention should be paid to the differences between G alone and its formulations, which, containing substances able to increase G absorption, may present a different toxicity profile. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Samples were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass accuracy spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS), operating in full-scan MS and data-dependent acquisition (ddMS2) modes. A total of 78 co-formulants were tentatively identified by a combination of suspect screening and unknown analysis. Nine of them were later confirmed by analytical standards. Finally, the analytical method was successfully validated and co-formulants were quantified. Linear alkyl ethoxylates (LAS) were the most common type of co-formulant, followed by sodium alkylbenzene sulfonates. Moreover, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate had the highest concentration of any co-formulant (up to 32.33 g/L). In all, an innovative identification of co-formulants in a large number of PPPs is presented, which will give room for future studies delving into the composition of PPPs or determining these co-formulants in environmental or agricultural samples. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Median lethal dose (LD50) of the IMI-based formulation tested was 57.11 mg IMI/kg body weight (bw), with intoxication signs starting from 20.6 mg IMI/kg bw. The feed intake rate (FIR) was estimated experimentally as 4.895 g/day per bird, representing 12.43% of bw. It was calculated that the ingestion of 7–10% of the FIR as treated seeds would be enough to achieve the LD50 for sorghum, corn, sunflower, and alfalfa, whereas consumption of 31 and 54% of FIR was necessary for oat and wheat, respectively. Based on spill data values available in the literature, it was calculated that, for most crops, a baywing would have to forage an area of field corresponding to less than 60 m2 to obtain the number of seeds required to reach the LD50. It was also shown that this number of seeds is coherent with the amount of seeds ingested in a bout. In a pilot study, all grayish baywings fed with millet seeds treated with 3 g IMI/kg died within three to five days of exposure. In Tier I risk assessment, the trigger value was achieved for all crops except soybean and a weight-of-evidence risk assessment was performed. All lines of evidence examined are consistent with the view that grayish baywings, and probably other small farmland birds, are exposed to a risk of acute toxicity and mortality under both worst-case and mixed-ration exposure scenarios. The possible impacts on bird species calls for an urgent reconsideration of IMI seed coating practices currently approved in the Pampa Region of Argentina and the various parts of the world where this practice is still in use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

However, GBH encompass a variety of glyphosate salts as active ingredient and different adjuvants, which differ between products. These herbicides reach water bodies and produce diverse impacts over aquatic communities. Yet, the risk assessment assays required for the approval focus mostly on active ingredients. Herein, we compared the effect of five different GBH as well as of monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA) on aquatic microbial communities from natural shallow lakes that were mixed and allowed to evolve in an outdoor pond. We performed an 8-day long assay under indoor control conditions to evaluate the effects of exposure on the structure of nano-plus microphytoplankton (net phytoplankton, with sizes between 2 and 20 μm and >20 μm, respectively) and picoplankton (size ranging between 0.2 and 2 μm) communities through microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Significantly different effects were evident on the structure of microbial communities dependent on the GBH, even with herbicides sharing similar active ingredients. Each GBH evoked increases of different magnitude in bacterioplankton abundance. Furthermore, GIPA and a formulation decreased the abundance of a phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) picocyanobacteria (Pcy) cytometric population and GIPA further altered Pcy composition. Also, two GBH increased net phytoplankton total abundance and, unlike the tested GBH, no apparent effect of GIPA was detected on this community structure. These results demonstrate that GBH effects on aquatic microbial communities should not be summarized as “glyphosate” effects considering that the formulations have effects beyond those exerted by the active ingredients alone. This work intends to alert on the lack of real knowledge regarding the consequences of the variety of GBH on natural aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, the wide use of the term “glyphosate effect” should be thoroughly rethought. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The aim of this paper was to systematically review glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity literature to determine its usefulness in regulatory decision-making. The review was restricted to mammalian studies of behavior, neuropathology, and neuropharmacology; in vitro and other biochemical studies were considered supplementary information. Glyphosate formulation studies were also considered, despite uncertainties regarding toxicities of the formulated products; no studies used a formulation vehicle as the control. Inclusion criteria were developed a priori to ensure consistent evaluation of studies, and in vivo investigations were also ranked using ToxRTool software to determine reliability. There were 27 in vivo studies (open literature and available regulatory reports), but 11 studies were considered unreliable (mostly due to critical methodological deficiencies). There were only seven acceptable investigations on glyphosate alone. Studies differed in terms of dosing scenarios, experimental designs, test species, and commercial product. Limitations included using only one dose and/or one test time, small sample sizes, limited data presentation, and/or overtly toxic doses. While motor activity was the most consistently affected endpoint (10 of 12 studies), there were considerable differences in outcomes. In six investigations, there were no marked neuropathological changes in the central or peripheral nervous system. Other neurological effects were less consistent, and some outcomes were less convincing due to influences including high variability and small effect sizes. Taken together, these studies do not demonstrate a consistent impact of glyphosate on the structure or function of the mammalian nervous system. © 2022 The Author(s).

Bti-based insecticides are considered highly selective, being Diptera-specific, and supposedly decompose rapidly in the environment. Nevertheless, their safety to non-target species and freshwater ecosystems has been questioned by recent studies, which in fact document possible indirect effects in aquatic food webs such as the decrease of prey availability to predators. This work aimed to evaluate the potential effects of a Bti-based insecticide (VectoBac® 12AS) on a freshwater macroinvertebrate community and on stream ecological functions by using artificial microcosm streams. Artificial microcosm streams were colonized with a macroinvertebrate community plus periphyton collected in a stream together with Alnus glutinosa leaf packs. They were exposed for 7 days to different Bti treatments (0, 12, 120, 1200 μg/L), which are within the recommended concentrations of application in aquatic compartments for blackfly and mosquito control. Besides invertebrate community structure and abundance, effects were evaluated regarding leaf decomposition and primary production as measures of ecosystem functioning. Community structure was significantly altered in all Bti treatments after 7 days of exposure, mostly due to a decline in chironomids, followed by oligochaetes, which both belong to the deposit-feeders’ functional group. Direct effects on oligochaetes are surprising and require further research. Also, reductions of leaf decomposition due to Bti-induced sublethal effects on shredders (reduced feeding) or mortality of chironomids (that can also feed on coarse organic matter) observed in our study, represent potential indirect effects of Bti in aquatic ecosystems. Our short-exposure experiment evidenced some negative effects on stream benthic invertebrate communities and on ecosystem functioning that must be considered whenever Bti is used in water bodies for blackfly or mosquito control programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The commercial success of this molecule is due to its nonselectivity and its action, which would supposedly target specific biosynthetic pathways found mainly in plants. Multiple studies have however provided evidence for high sensitivity of many nontarget species to glyphosate and/or to formulations (glyphosate mixed with surfactants). This herbicide, found at significant levels in aquatic systems through surface runoffs, impacts life history traits and immune parameters of several aquatic invertebrates' species, including disease-vector mosquitoes. Mosquitoes, from hatching to emergence, are exposed to aquatic chemical contaminants. In this study, we first compared the toxicity of pure glyphosate to the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations for the main vector of avian malaria in Europe, Culex pipiens mosquito. Then we evaluated, for the first time, how field-realistic dose of glyphosate interacts with larval nutritional stress to alter mosquito life history traits and susceptibility to avian malaria parasite infection. Our results show that exposure of larvae to field-realistic doses of glyphosate, pure or in formulation, did not affect larval survival rate, adult size, and female fecundity. One of our two experimental blocks showed, however, that exposure to glyphosate decreased development time and reduced mosquito infection probability by malaria parasite. Interestingly, the effect on malaria infection was lost when the larvae were also subjected to a nutritional stress, probably due to a lower ingestion of glyphosate. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet, for many, toxic exposures signal life-changing or life-ending events, phantom threats that fail to appear as such until they become too late to mitigate. Assessments of toxicological risk consist of what Sheila Jasanoff calls “sociotechnical imaginaries,” arbitrations between calculated costs and benefits, known risks and scientifically wrought justifications of safety. Prevalent financial conflicts of interest and the socially determined hazards posed by chemical exposure suggest that chemical safety assessments and regulations are a form of postnormal science.

Glyphosate is polar and water soluble and therefore does not bioaccumulate, biomagnify, or accumulate to high levels in the environment. It sorbs strongly to particles in soil and sediments and this reduces bioavailability so that exposures to non-target organisms in the environment are acute and decrease with half-lives in the order of hours to a few days. The target site for glyphosate is not known to be expressed in animals, which reduces the probability of toxicity and small risks. Technical glyphosate (acid or salts) is of low to moderate toxicity; however, when mixed with some formulants such as polyoxyethylene amines (POEAs), toxicity to aquatic animals increases about 15-fold on average. However, glyphosate and the formulants have different fates in the environment and they do not necessarily co-occur. Therefore, toxicity tests on formulated products in scenarios where they would not be used are unrealistic and of limited use for assessment of risk. Concentrations of glyphosate in surface water are generally low with minimal risk to aquatic organisms, including plants. Toxicity and risks to non-target terrestrial organisms other than plants treated directly are low and risks to terrestrial invertebrates and microbial processes in soil are very small. Formulations containing POEAs are not labeled for use over water but, because POEA rapidly partitions into sediment, risks to aquatic organisms from accidental over-sprays are reduced in shallow water bodies. We conclude that use of formulations of glyphosate under good agricultural practices presents a de minimis risk of direct and indirect adverse effects in non-target organisms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Efficacy was evaluated 1 d after treatment (DAT) and then at 7d interval until 21 DAT. Scorch® was able to improve the efficacy of both the insecticides against L. botrana at all DAT intervals. The higher efficacy was supported by the lower values of the surface tension and the contact angle parameters of the spray solutions. By reducing the insecticides application rates by 20 per cent and adding adjuvant in the spraying liquid, the control efficiency was very similar to that of the treatment with the recommended rates.

Demir E.,  Drosophila as a model for assessing nanopesticide toxicity,2020,Nanotoxicology,14,1271,1279,10.1080/17435390.2020.1815886,"One of the fastest-moving fields in today’s world of applied science, nanotechnology allows the control and design of matter on an extremely small scale, so it has now become an integral part of various industries and scientific areas, such as agriculture, food sector, healthcare and engineering. Understanding the interactions between nanopesticides and edible plants, as well as non-target animals, is crucial in assessing the potential impact of nanotechnology products on the environment, agriculture and human health. The dramatic increase in efforts to use nanopesticides renders the risk assessment of their toxicity and genotoxicity highly crucial due to the potential adverse impact of this relatively uncharted territory. Such widespread use naturally increases our exposure to nanopesticides, raising concerns over their possible adverse effects on humans and non-target organisms, which might include severe impairment of both male and female reproductive capacity. We therefore need better insight into such effects to derive conclusive evidence on the safety or toxicity/genotoxicity of nanopesticides, and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) can prove an ideal model organism for the risk assessment and toxicological classification of nanopesticides, as it bears striking similarities to various systems in human body. This editorial review attempts to summarize our current knowledge derived from previous in vivo studies to examine the impact of several nanomaterials on various species of mammals and non-target model organisms at the genetic, cellular, and molecular levels, attracting attention to the possible mechanisms and potential toxic/genotoxic effects of nanopesticides widely used in agriculture on D. melanogaster as a non-target organism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

A meta-analytic review",2022,Environmental Pollution,303,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119179,"The 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an auxinic herbicide widely used in agriculture that is effective in controlling weeds. It is directly applied to the soil, to ponds or sprayed onto crops; thus, it can progressively accumulate in environmental compartments and affect non-target organisms. The aim of the present meta-analytic review is to investigate the toxic effects of 2,4-D, based on a compilation of results from different studies, which were synthesized to form a statistically reliable conclusion about the lethal effect of potentially ecological concentrations of 2,4-D in several animal species. The search was carried out in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the selection process was over, 87 datasets were generated and analyzed. The overall effect has indicated significant increase in the mortality rate recorded for animals exposed to environmental concentrations of 2,4-D compared to the control in the experiment (unexposed animals). The segregation of animals into taxonomic categories has shown that fish and birds presented higher mortality rates after exposure to the investigated substance. The present meta-analysis indicated larval and adult animals were susceptible among the ontogenetic development stages. Juvenile individuals exposed to different 2,4-D concentrations did not show significant difference in comparison to the control. Organisms exposed to 2,4-D immersion were the most impacted compared to those exposed by oral, spray and contact. Animals subjected to commercial formulation presented higher mortality rate than the analytical standard. Thus, 2,4-D can, in fact, increase mortality rate in animals, but it depends on species sensitivity, life stage and exposure route. This is the first meta-analytical study evaluating the mortality rate after 2,4-D exposure in several animal species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
Centner T.J.,Pesticide usage is compromising people’s health in the united states: Ideas for reducing damages,2021,Agriculture (Switzerland),11,,,10.3390/agriculture11060486,"The development of synthetic pesticides has provided new tools for addressing troublesome pests. A review of parts of the registration process for pesticides in the United States identifies an outdated evaluation system that undervalues health damages. Registration fails to adequately consider co-formulants and effects of exposure to multiple chemicals. Frustration with failures to protect people and property from damages accompanying pesticide usage has led injured plaintiffs to resort to tort lawsuits to secure relief. However, litigation involves compensating injured persons after they are injured rather than preventing injury. A more proactive approach would be to prevent situations that injure people. This paper offers four ideas to reduce health damages accompanying pesticide usage. Slight adjustments to pesticide registration requirements can offer greater protection for people’s health. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

This study is based on a qualitative content analysis of 77 briefs submitted to a public hearing organized by the National Assembly of Quebec (Canada) on pesticide use, which led to 30 testimonies from stakeholders that either oppose or defend the use of pesticides. This study highlights the sustainability-related stigma faced by organizations vilified because of the environmental, health and ethical issues raised at the hearing. The results also show the impression management strategies and neutralization techniques used by these organizations to respond to the stigma. These techniques are essentially based on neutralizing the stigma (denial, claims of victimhood, defense of social justice and rural traditions) and on the exemplification of existing practices (sustainability stewardship, promotion of science and progress, fight against common enemies). The article contributes to the literature on organizational stigma and on neutralization techniques by proposing an integrative model illustrating the main strategies used by companies to defend the legitimacy of controversial activities.

The adjuvant ACTTRA SWD, when mixed with a suitable insecticide, constitutes an innovative attract-and-kill tactic that can be applied as a sprayable bait to manage D. suzukii. As an adjuvant, growers can mix ACTTRA SWD with any insecticide recommended for D. suzukii management in a specific crop; however, to achieve this, the efficacy of this adjuvant incorporated with various insecticides needs testing. This research aims to test the suitability of nine insecticides added to two ACTTRA SWD formulations (named OR1 and TD) to maintain the formulation’s attractiveness to D. suzukii adults and in resulting mortality. We conducted a series of two-choice bioassays to test the relative attraction of D. suzukii to ACTTRA SWD formulations prepared with and without a specific insecticide. Additionally, we tested the efficacy of ACTTRA SWD formulations mixed with insecticides in managing D. suzukii by using no-choice efficacy bioassays. Adding Mustang Maxx (zeta-cypermethrin) to ACTTRA SWD OR1 significantly improved D. suzukii adult attraction to the formulation, while Azera (azadirachtin + pyrethrins) significantly reduced attraction to both ACTTRA SWD formulations. Among the insecticides tested, we identified Danitol (fenpropathrin), Exirel (cyantraniliprole), Malathion (malathion), Mustang Maxx, and Entrust (spinosad) as suitable insecticide additives for both ACTTRA SWD formulations. The results from this study will assist growers in selecting proper insecticide components when preparing attract-and-kill formulations of the new adjuvant ACTTRA SWD.

The structures of diphenyl ether pesticides and their metabolites are very similar to the structure of THs. Based on this, in silico molecular simulation approaches were used to predict, screen, evaluate and identify the binding interactions of 98 diphenyl ether structure pesticides and their metabolites (DEPMs) with 10 THs related proteins in the study. The research results indicated that these DEPMs such as fluoroglycofen (FOG), rafoxanide, diclofop, ethoxyfen and difenopenten were considered to have the greater potentials to interfere with the related proteins of THs biosynthesis, blood transport, receptor binding and metabolism. And FOG can interact with thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ) to form non-bond interactions. Furthermore, the results of molecular dynamics simulations showed that there were strong and stable interactions between FOG and TRβ. These results suggested that the herbicide FOG was likely to disturb THs nuclear receptor. And benzene rings and hydrophobic groups might be the characteristic chemical functional groups for DEPMs to disrupt TRβ. The relevant results of this study can be used to provide references for environmental toxicology evaluation, food safety risk assessment, and formulation and revision of pesticides and their metabolites residue limits in agricultural products and food. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The wide use of bioallethrin has resulted in inevitable human exposure. In this study we report the effect of different concentrations of bioallethrin (10 to 200 µM, 2 h at 37 °C) on human lymphocytes under in vitro conditions. Bioallethrin treatment resulted in loss of cell viability (> 30% at 200 µM bioallethrin). Oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were significantly increased accompanied by lower ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione. Enhanced ROS generation was observed through fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Bioallethrin-induced oxidative stress also compromised the antioxidant defence as it reduced antioxidant capacity of cells and inhibited major antioxidant enzymes. Biomolecular modifications and systemic toxicity by bioallethrin resulted in plasma membrane damage with mitochondrial depolarization. Comet assay showed nuclear DNA fragmentation and strand scission with significant increase in tail length and olive tail moment. Apoptosis and necrosis of cells was confirmed through acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual staining and visualization under fluorescence microscope. Thus, bioallethrin causes oxidative damage and compromises the antioxidant system leading to DNA damage, cellular and organelle toxicity, resulting in apoptosis and necrosis of human lymphocytes. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Foremost among them are the differences found in testing pure glyphosate compared to the testing of glyphosate formulations. The adjuvant chemicals found in formulations can be more toxic than the so-called “active ingredient.” Other factors can also account for why scientists reach different conclusions on the toxicological effects of GBH including the preconceptions and methodological choices they bring into the study. Lack of consensus on the science can be problematic for policymakers. The paper argues that the toxicological science behind the GBH assessments is embedded in a normative substratum, which must be considered in policy decisions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Nevertheless, success in the control of RKN depends on the compatibility of the fungus with pesticides used to manage other pests and diseases. We tested the in vitro acute and chronic effects of twelve different commercial pesticides used throughout a tomato cropping cycle on P. chlamydosporia. All pesticides significantly inhibited radial growth of the fungus at 22 days, with exception of methiocarb (Mesurol 200), spiromesifen (Oberon), copper-metalaxyl-M (Ridomil Gold R) and oxamyl (Vydate 10L). All fungicides produced significant acute and chronic negative effects on chlamydospore viability. Insecticides methiocarb, spinosad (Spintor) and indoxacarb (Steward) did not affect chlamydospore germination at the tested concentration of active substance (100 mg·L−1) of pesticide in the acute effects test, but all tested pesticides significantly reduced chlamydospore viability in the chronic 6-week-exposure test. Importantly, chlamydospore germination rates recorded were higher in the 12-week than in the 6-week-exposure chronic test, hinting at P. chlamydosporia acclimation or recovery. In view of differences in compatibility of commercial pesticides with P. chlamydosporia, acting on different fungal life stages in acute and chronic processes, these must be carefully selected and the timing of their application considered in the design of crop protection strategies against RKN to improve the biological control success. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
Bondareva L.; Fedorova N.,Pesticides: Behavior in agricultural soil and plants,2021,Molecules,26,,,10.3390/molecules26175370,"This review considers potential approaches to solve an important problem concerning the impact of applied pesticides of various classes on living organisms, mainly agricultural crops used as food. We used the method of multi-residual determination of several pesticides in agricultural food products with its practical application for estimating pesticides in real products and in model experiments. The distribution of the pesticide between the components of the soil-plant system was studied with a pesticide of the sulfonylureas class, i.e., rimsulfuron. Autoradiography showed that rimsulfuron inhibits the development of plants considered as weeds. Cereals are less susceptible to the effects of pesticides such as acetamiprid, flumetsulam and florasulam, while the development of legume shoots was inhibited with subsequent plant death. © 2021 by the authors.

CI is characterized by multisystem symptoms and new-onset intolerances that develop in a subset of individuals following a major chemical exposure event or repeated low-level exposures. While Toxicant-Induced Loss of Tolerance (TILT) is a two-stage disease mechanism proposed to explain CI, less is known about the exposures that initiate the disease, than about the intolerances that have been documented. Methods: We reviewed eight major exposure events that preceded onset of chemical intolerance in groups of individuals sharing the same exposure. Our goal was to identify the chemicals and/or groups of chemicals that were most pervasive during each exposure event as well as identify the concentrations of key chemicals involved in each exposure event and the proportions of exposed individuals who ultimately developed TILT following exposure. Case studies we selected for review included (1) workers at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters during renovations; (2) Gulf War veterans; (3) pesticide exposure among casino workers; (4) exposure to aircraft oil fumes; (5) the World Trade Center tragedy; (6) surgical implants; (7) moldy environments; and (8) tunnel workers exposed to solvents. Results: Mixed volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs), followed by pesticides and combustion products were most prevalent across TILT initiation events. As a broader category, synthetic organic chemicals and their combustion products were the primary exposures associated with chemical intolerance. Such chemicals included pesticides, peroxides, nerve agents, anti-nerve agent drugs, lubricants and additives, xylene, benzene, and acetone. Conclusion: A select group of exposures were predominant in several major initiating events, suggesting their potential role in TILT initiation. Such insights are useful to public health scientists, physicians, and policymakers seeking to minimize harmful exposures and prevent future disease. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Since these compounds are potentially toxic to the target organisms, they could also be harmful to human health and the environment. Several chronic adverse effects have been identified even after months or years of exposure. A few pesticide degradation processes have been studied including adsorption, homogeneous and heterogeneous (photo)catalytic oxidation, and biological methods. Although these methods have been playing a significant part in the pesticide’s degradation, there are still gaps in many aspects. Here, we review the catalytic degradation of these pollutants by (metallo)porphyrins. To evaluate the P450 cytochrome’s biomimetic behavior of these catalysts, various synthesized porphyrins have been used since 1999 and their activities were summarized in this manuscript. The porphyrins appear to act as good catalysts for the degradation of pesticides; in fact, they also have been shown as a useful tool for the elucidation of their degradation products. Achieving pesticide mineralization without intermediate products is still challenging, although the ability of this kind of catalysts to conduct the formation of some lower toxic products comparing their precursors has been verified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
Straw E.A.; Carpentier E.N.; Brown M.J.F.,Roundup causes high levels of mortality following contact exposure in bumble bees,2021,Journal of Applied Ecology,58,1167,1176,10.1111/1365-2664.13867,"Pollinators underpin global food production, but they are suffering significant declines across the world. Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered ‘bee safe’ by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup®) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup® products, the consumer products Roundup® Ready-To-Use and Roundup® No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup® ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol®. Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup® Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup® Ready-To-Use® and 30% mortality with Roundup® ProActive®, over 24 hr. Weedol® did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup® No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup® Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup® products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup® products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup® products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

Although use of neonicotinoid pesticides has resulted in the widespread contamination of surface waters, sublethal toxicity data of these products in relation to non-target aquatic biota are still poor. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of two neonicotinoid pesticides with widespread use on the basic physiological functions: the thoracic limb activity and heart rate of Daphnia magna, and to screen for their potential to affect the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system (ECOD activity) of daphnids. The considered pesticides were the acetamiprid- and thiacloprid based products Mospilan 20 SG and Calypso 480 SC, respectively. The dose-dependent variation in the three biological endpoints considered were assessed following 24 h exposures. The two neonicotinoid formulations elicited significant depression on the thoracic limb activity and heart rate of daphnids at doses close to the immobility thresholds of formulations (48h-EC50: Mospilan 20 SG = 190 mg L−1; Calypso 480 SC = 120 mg L−1), an effect mainly attributable to the overall drop in the general health status of the organisms. The alterations in the physiological traits were significant at exposures to 190 mg L−1 for Mospilan 20 SG and 48 mg L−1 for Calypso 480 SC. The dose related variation in the ECOD activity of daphnids exposed to the selected neonicotinoid formulations followed a biphasic pattern, with starting effective doses for Mospilan 20 SG of 6.3 mg L−1 (=1/20 of 48h-EC50 for Daphnia neonates), and for Calypso 480 SC of 0.034 mg L−1 (=1/4000 of 48h-EC50). Maximal ECOD activity (2.2 fold increase vs. controls) was induced by Mospilan 20 SG in daphnids exposed to 114 mg L−1 product (=48 h-EC20), and by Calypso 480 SC (1.8 fold increase) at 5.2 mg L−1 dose (=1/20 of 48 h-EC50). Our results outlined significant alterations in the physiological traits and ECOD activity in exposed daphnids at concentrations below the immobility thresholds (48 h-EC50) of the products used as benchmarks to rate their toxicity risks to aquatic biota. Therefore, we think our findings might deserve consideration in the environmental risk evaluation of these products. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
Straw E.A.; Thompson L.J.; Leadbeater E.; Brown M.J.F.,"Inert ingredients are understudied, potentially dangerous to bees and deserve more research attention",2022,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,289,,,10.1098/rspb.2021.2353,"Agrochemical formulations are composed of two broad groups of chemicals: active ingredients, which confer pest control action, and 'inert' ingredients, which facilitate the action of the active ingredient. Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here. If so-called 'inert' ingredients are, in fact, detrimental to bee health, their potential role in widespread bee declines needs urgent assessment. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

This in-depth study of a public hearing on pesticides set up by the National Assembly of Quebec (Canada) in 2019 shows the often very strong positions held by the relevant stakeholders and how they legitimize their positions. The qualitative content analysis of 77 briefs and 30 testimonies highlights five main institutional logics that contribute to the institutionalization of pesticide use despite the strong opposition it generates: the economic and strategic logic, the regulatory and administrative logic, the tailored advice and support logic, the research and innovation logic, and the traditional, rural and pragmatic logic. These logics show how the objectives, belief systems, and practices shared by pro-pesticide organizations can hold sway, including over public bodies that are a priori independent but tend to play a buffering and facilitating role in the use of these controversial products. This article contributes to the literature on institutional logics and corporate sustainability by showing how some of these logics can contribute to the continuation of unsustainable practices over time. The article also contributes to the often highly technical literature on the use and impacts of pesticides by proposing an institutional approach that provides an overall picture of the positions of several interdependent organizations and how their underlying belief systems influence practices.

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results: The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions: The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures. This emphasizes the importance of a more integrated eco-toxicological assessment of commercial pesticide preparations not to underestimate their effects on the environment.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s)."

The toxicity assays were performed with two oligochaetes (earthworms Eisenia andrei and enchytraeids Enchytraeus crypticus) and three collembolans (Folsomia candida, Proisotoma minuta and Sinella curviseta) species following ISO protocols. Risk assessment (via Hazard Quotient approach – HQ) was based on the hazardous concentrations for 95% of the species (HC5), derived from chronic Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) for clothianidin, and on its predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). Four SSD scenarios were generated with literature and/or this study data, following different data selection criteria (i.e., general, only data from tests using similar formulations, similar soils, or identical soil/formulation). In our experiments, a higher clothianidin toxicity (EC50-based) was found for collembolans (varying from 0.11 to 0.28 mg kg−1 between species) followed by the earthworms (4.35 mg kg−1), while the enchytraeids were the least sensitive (33.5 mg kg−1). HQ indicated a significant risk of clothianidin to soil invertebrates because the estimated PEC were at least 16.6 times higher than HC5 and are expected to affect the whole group of collembolans. Despite the criteria for data inclusion have influenced the HC5 values, no substantial changes were observed for the risk outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the chronic ecological risk of clothianidin to beneficial soil fauna based on a probabilistic SSD approach. Data from this study can help to derive more reliable protection thresholds for clothianidin in soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
