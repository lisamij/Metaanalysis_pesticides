However, despite the advantages presented, much has been discussed about their harmful effects on exposed organisms, either directly or indirectly, with regards to endocrine disruption. This study aimed to evaluate the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid (IMD) and abamectin (ABA) formulations, separately and combined, on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at different developmental stages. For this, Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) tests were carried out, exposing two hours post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish to 96 hours of treatments with five different concentrations of abamectin (0.5-11.7 mg L-1), imidacloprid (0.0001-1.0 mg L-1), and imidacloprid/abamectin mixtures (LC50/2 - LC50/1000). The results showed that IMD and ABA caused toxic effects in zebrafish embryos. Significant effects were observed regarding egg coagulation, pericardial edema, and lack of larvae hatching. However, unlike ABA, the IMD dose-response curve for mortality had a bell curve display, where medium doses caused more mortality than higher and lower doses. These data demonstrate the toxic influence of sublethal IMD and ABA concentrations on zebrafish, suggesting that these compounds should be listed for river and reservoir water-quality monitoring."

It is an emerging environmental contaminant that has been detected in surface waters, raising the possibility of human exposure via drinking water. Because it is not subject to the same regulations as active pesticide ingredients, its metabolism and toxicity in humans have not been studied. Here we investigate the enantioselective metabolism of benoxacor in human subcellular fractions. Pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and cytosol (pHLC) were incubated with racemic benoxacor for up to 30-min. Gas chromatographic analyses were used to measure the enantioselective depletion of benoxacor. pHLMs with and without nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH, co-factor for cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]) and pHLC with glutathione (GSH, co-factor for glutathione Stransferases [GSTs]) metabolized benoxacor. These results demonstrate that microsomal CYPs, microsomal carboxylesterase (CESs), and cytosolic GSTs metabolize benoxacor. Females were predicted to have a higher clearance of benoxacor by GSTs than males. Male and female pHLM incubations with NADPH showed enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer (E1-benoxacor). pHLM incubations without NADPH and pHLC incubations with GSH showed an enrichment of the second eluting enantiomer of benoxacor (E2-benoxacor). Our results indicate that human hepatic microsomal and cytosolic enzymes enantioselectively metabolize benoxacor, a fact that needs to be considered when investigating human exposures and toxicities of benoxacor.

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment."

At present, microbial pesticide formulations are mainly wettable powders and suspension concentrations, which are usually produced with adjuvants such as surfactants, carriers, protective agents, and nutritional adjuvants. Surfactants can improve the tension between liquid pesticides and crop surfaces, resulting in stronger permeability and wettability of the formulations. Carriers are inert components of loaded or diluted pesticides, which can control the release of active components at appropriate times. Protective agents are able to help microorganisms to resist in adverse environments. Nutritional adjuvants are used to provide nutrients for microorganisms in microbial pesticides. Most of the adjuvants used in microbial pesticides still refer to those of chemical pesticides. However, some adjuvants may have harmful effects on non-target organisms and ecological environments. Herein, in order to promote research and improvement of microbial pesticides, the types of microbial pesticide formulations were briefly reviewed, and research progress of adjuvants and their applications in microbial pesticides were highlighted, the challenges and the future perspectives towards sustainable green adjuvants of microbial pesticides were also discussed in this review."

However, there have been many problems caused by herbicide formulations, such as volatilization, leaching, and rainwashing loss in the process of agricultural application. Selfassembled nanotechnology is a promising strategy to solve these existing problems due to the environmentally friendly preparation process and high delivery efficiency. In this study, the stable fluorescent nanoparticles (AP NPs) based on co-assembly of acifluorfen (ACI) and poly(salicylic acid) (PSA) are constructed by using non-covalent bond interactions. The results indicate that the obtained nanoparticles with a stable fluorescence characteristic show improved physiochemical properties, such as uniform morphology, good thermal stability, low surface tension, and high retention on plants. The co-assembly can produce singlet oxygen to enhance the herbicidal activity under irradiation of light and reduce the leaching property of ACI to minimize the adverse impact on the aquatic environment. The safety evaluation of soybean seedlings indicates that AP NPs have no damage to non-target plants. In summary, the co-assembled herbicidal nano-formulation composed of ACI and PSA has high bioactivity and low environmental risks, which can be widely used in agricultural production."

Two formulation agents of toxicological concern, Naphthalene and Solvent Naphtha (Petroleum), Heavy Aromatic, were simulated from their usage in commercially-applied pesticides. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate these formulation agents during 2011-2014 in the agriculturally intensive Sacramento River watershed. The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26-31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level. Since many formulation agents are widely used in pesticides throughout this and other agri-culturally impacted watersheds, their potential risks in the environment need more thorough investigation by modeling and monitoring, especially for areas with heavy usage."

The insecticide concentrations tested were the same for all organisms (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 mg L-1 of Actellic 50 EC), with an exposure of 3-5-21 days for plants and 4-5-14 days for animals. The non-target organisms tested were both plants (wheat and two ferns) and animals (the Prussian carp and marsh frog tadpoles). The tested insecticide significantly inhibited the growth of roots in wheat, a result that was also confirmed by a microbiotest application (62% root growth inhibition in sorghum and 100% germination inhibition in white mustard and garden cress). In ferns, even for the lowest concentration, the percentage of germinated spores was inhibited by 40% for Asplenium scolopendrium. The recorded toxicological effects of Actellic 50 EC upon the Prussian carp included a decrease in the respiratory rate and oxygen consumption, an increase in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes, and an increase in blood glucose levels. The highest concentration (0.1 mg L-1 of Actellic 50 EC) caused a 50% decrease in the survival rate of marsh frog tadpoles after 5 days of exposure, negatively affecting body volume and length. Given the high degree of toxicity of the insecticide Actellic 50 EC, we recommend continuing investigations on non-target species, including both plants and animals, as the sub-chronic effects are quite little known in the scientific literature."

This study aimed to assess the effects of four common pesticides on the microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata: DIAZINON (R) 25% C. E., Roundup (R), URBACIN (R) 20C. E., and VAPODEL (R) 20% C. E., which are commercial formulations of diazinon, glyphosate, dichlorvos, and cypermethrin, respectively. According to 96-h inhibition of population growth bioassays, the four pesticide toxicities exemplified the following order: DIAZINON (R) (diazinon) > Roundup (R) (glyphosate) > VAPODEL (R) (dichlorvos) > URBACIN (R) (cypermethrin). Increasing pesticide concentrations elicited alterations in the specific growth rates (mu max). The macromolecule contents and photosynthetic pigments increased in groups exposed to the highest concentrations of DIAZINON (R) 25%, Roundup (R), and URBACIN (R) 20 compared to the control group, despite these treatments inducing lower population growth rates. VAPODEL (R) 20% induced higher growth rates and lower macromolecule content compared to the control. Since active ingredients were not quantified, certain comparisons may prove limiting, but it is important to assess the effects of the whole mixtures in the form that they enter the environment, especially for urban-intended applications or generic formulations with higher additive contents. Finally, this study demonstrated that commercial pesticide formulations designed for urban applications might pose a threat to freshwater microalgae due to their underestimated toxic potential, but further studies are required."

To assess this, caged tilapia samples were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP). Fish samples in acetone/hexane (2:1v/v) solvent medium were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath, shaken electronically, cleaned by solid-phase extraction, and analysed using GC/ECD for OCPs and GC/MS for PCBs. The levels of OCPs reported in the fish ranged; ND - 2.31 mu g/kg (fish farm A), <LOD - 4.3 mu g/kg (fish farm B), <LOD - 6.11 mu g/kg (fish farm C) and ND - 0.88 mu g/kg (control). The highest concentration of 6.11 mu g/kg was encountered for delta-HCH in tilapia from fish farm C, while p,p'-DDE recorded the lowest in fish from Farm A. The levels of the OCPs detected in cage tilapia were below the maximum residue limits (MRL) proposed by the EU. Six PCBs congeners, i.e., PCB 18, PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 101, PCB153 and PCB 180 were detected and concentrations ranged from 0.288 to 0.931 mu g/kg dw, 0.042-1.321 mu g/kg dw, 0.260-10.657 mu g/kg dw, and ND - 0.298 mu g/kg dw in fish Farms A, B, C and control, respectively. Risk assessment of POPs indicated that n-ary sumation PCBs in Farm C fish may pose health risk to consumers. Further analysis revealed that Farms B and C fish polluted with endrin may pose cancer risk to children consumers. Frequent monitoring of PCBs, OCPs and other contaminants is needed to mitigate the impacts on human health."

This policy is thought to partially explain the conflicting outcomes of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and EPA assessments on glyphosate, and there is substantial scientific evidence that this approach has led to an underestimation of risk. In this paper, we present a review of EPA pesticide policy governing the regulation of active and other ingredients and findings from a survey of US agricultural scientists focused on their views of this EPA policy. The survey findings indicate that the scientists we surveyed support a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of pesticide products, including both active and inert ingredients, as well as the end use product, to test for combined effects. They also support the disclosure and labeling of inert ingredients to support independent testing of these chemicals. The results also indicate that university scientists oriented towards public science are more likely to support regulation than university scientists oriented towards private science. Overall, despite substantial evidence that the combination of all ingredients in pesticide products may be more toxic than the active ingredients alone, the current regulatory approach does not provide a pathway for the agency to respond to this science. In this sense, the scientific support for the agency's current regulatory approach is unclear."

These include active ingredients intended to kill pests, and so-called inert ingredients intended to improve the physical characteristics of the product. In addition, shortly before applying a pesticide product, applicators often mix adjuvants into the sprayer tank. Adjuvants are products designed to improve the performance or physical properties of a pesticide spray mixture. Manufacturers may use a particular chemical compound both as an inert ingredient within pesticide products and as a component of adjuvant products. Nonetheless, regulations dictate that data on use are publicly available only for the portion used in adjuvants. Adjuvants are exempt from federal registration, but are defined as pesticides in California. Based on that definition, California has identified a-(p-nonylphenyl)-x-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) (APNOHO) as the most widely used pesticide in the state, applied to more than 10 million acres annually. That quantified use includes only agricultural acres treated with adjuvants containing APNOHO. Total APNOHO use is likely higher because manufacturers also use the chemical as an inert ingredient within pesticide products, although data on such use are shielded by regulation. OBJECTIVES: We use APNOHO as a case study to demonstrate that the use of adjuvants and inert ingredients is difficult to track because relevant information is not publicly available. We synthesize information that suggests widespread agricultural use of alkylphenol ethoxylates, such as APNOHO, may pose significant human and environmental health risks. We then make recommendations for future research and policy. METHODS: We used information from California???s pesticide use reporting system and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate use of APNOHO. We used U.S. EPA and European databases, as well as published research, to identify human and environmental health hazards of APNOHO. We focused on research showing that APNOHO is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. DISCUSSION: Within California, APNOHO is applied in more than 150 adjuvant products. Nationwide, it is used as an inert ingredient in at least 650 pesticide products. Exposure to APNOHO is associated with endocrine disruption, birth defects, and aquatic toxicity. We suggest that the case of APNOHO illustrates the larger problem of a lack of publicly available data on use and toxicity of many adjuvants and pesticide inert ingredients. We recommend that researchers and regulators include adjuvants and inert ingredients when evaluating pesticide hazards, including endocrine disruption. We also recommend regulatory requirements to identify all ingredients on product labels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634"

Using an innovative system (Heterogeneous Multi-Habitat Test System HeMHAS) that allows the simulation of different scenarios within a spatially heterogeneous landscape, the effects on the habitat selection of Danio rerio fish caused by the pesticides fipronil and 2,4-D were studied as single compounds and in mixture and integrated with air temperature variation (20, 24 and 28 degrees C). As a result, D. rerio detected and avoided both pesticides at air temperatures of 20 and 24 degrees C; however, at 28 degrees C no significant difference was observed in habitat choice by fish. Additionally, when pesticides were mixed in a heterogeneously contaminated landscape, it was observed that D. rerio detected contamination and preferred the clean zone at 20 and 24 degrees C; however, at 28 degrees C the potential to escape from the most contaminated areas was impaired. Thus, contamination by both pesticides made the habitat selection behavior of fish at 20 and 24 degrees Cmore noticeable. In addition, the association between pesticides and temperature showed negative effects on the response of fish to detect and escape from contaminated environments, suggesting the influence of temperature in altering the ability of the organism to provide an efficient response to stress."

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 mu g/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Within the HBM4EU, eighteen priority substances or substance groups were chosen. In this scoping review, seven of these substances or substance groups are reported to have an association or a possible association with COPD. Main exposure routes, vulnerable and high-exposure risk groups, and matrices where these substances are measured are described. Pesticides in general and especially organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, and some herbicides, lead (Pb), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed an association, and cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr and CrVI), arsenic (As), and diisocyanates, a possible association with COPD and/or decreased lung function. Due to long latency in COPD's disease process, the role of chemical exposure as a risk factor for COPD is probably underestimated. More research is needed to support evidence-based conclusions. Generally, chemical exposure is a growing issue of concern, and prompt action is needed to safeguard public health."

Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here. If so-called 'inert' ingredients are, in fact, detrimental to bee health, their potential role in widespread bee declines needs urgent assessment."

In addition, we evaluated the impact of these pesticides on the ability of A. brasilense to promote plant growth by monitoring biometric traits (root and shoot dry mass and length) of wheat grown in Greenhouse conditions. Seed pesticide dressings, mainly fungicide, led to a significant mortality of A. brasilense over time. The ability of A. brasilense to promote wheat growth also decreased due to pesticide treatments combined with sowing delay. Considering that pesticides confer fitness advantages to the wheat in field condition, our results suggest that sowing within the first 4 h after inoculation maintain the beneficial effects of A. brasilense on wheat growth promotion. Furthermore, we conclude that inoculation and treatment of seeds with pesticides may be compatible techniques when carried out immediately before sowing."

Thus, the present study emphasizes upon glyphosate (GLY) induced toxicity and mitigating effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in testicular cells of caprine by using various cytotoxic and biochemical parameters. GLY was found to induce several apoptotic attributes such as pyknotic nuclei, tubular degeneration, increased vacuolization, and so on, in testicular cells. GLY also decreased the cell viability and increased the incidence of apoptosis in testicular cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as revealed by MTT assay and Fluorescence (ethidium bromide/acridine orange) assay, respectively. It also increased the level of oxidative stress as evident with an increase in lipid peroxidation and decline in antioxidant power along with the decreased enzymatic activity of different antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GST). However, NAC supplementation showed antagonistic results in GLY-treated testicular tissues with maximum amelioration at the highest dose, thereby decreasing GLY-mediated apoptosis rate and oxidative stress. Maximum amelioration was reported at 10 mM NAC concentration. Reduced GLY toxicity due to NAC will prove NAC to be an excellent approach for dealing with male reproductive toxicity at the cellular level, benefiting the mammalian reproductive status."

Metabolomic analysis identified 9 serum and 15 liver metabolites that were affected by benoxacor exposure, changes that were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. The activity of antioxidant enzymes was not altered by benoxacor exposure. In vitro metabolism studies with liver microsomes and cytosol from male mice demonstrated that benoxacor is enantioselectively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and glutathione S-transferases. These findings suggest that the minor toxic effects of benoxacor may be due to its rapid metabolism to toxic metabolites, such as dichloroacetic acid. This result challenges the assumption that inert ingredients of pesticide formulations are safe."

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects."

Research into, and regulation of pesticides has focused on the active ingredients, and their impact on bee health. In contrast, the additional components in pesticide formulations have been overlooked as potential threats. By testing an acute oral dose of the fungicide product Amistar, and equivalent doses of each individual co-formulant, we were able to measure the toxicity of the formulation and identify the ingredient responsible. We found that a co-formulant, alcohol ethoxylates, caused a range of damage to bumble bee health. Exposure to alcohol ethoxylates caused 30% mortality and a range of sublethal effects. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees consumed half as much sucrose as negative control bees over the course of the experiment and lost weight. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees had significant melanisation of their midguts, evidence of gut damage. We suggest that this gut damage explains the reduction in appetite, weight loss and mortality, with bees dying from energy depletion. Our results demonstrate that sublethal impacts of pesticide formulations need to be considered during regulatory consideration, and that co-formulants can be more toxic than active ingredients."

Unlike plant protection products (PPPs), adjuvants are not subjected to regulatory risk assessment. In practice, numerous combinations of PPPs and adjuvants are therefore possible. Thus, tank mixtures containing insecticides that are classified as non-hazardous to bees up to the highest approved application rate or concentration may raise pollinator safety concerns when mixed with efficacy increasing adjuvants and applied in bee-attractive crops. This study analyzes whether selected PPP-adjuvant combinations result in increased contact mortality and pose an elevated risk to honey bees. To answer this question, we chose six common spray adjuvants of different classes for laboratory screening. These were then tested in a total of 30 tank mixtures, each with a neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), diamide (chlorantraniliprole), carbamate (pirimicarb), and butenolide (flupyradifurone) formulation. We adapted an acute contact test (OECD Test Guideline 214) to our needs, e.g., by using a professional spray chamber for more realistic exposures. Our results showed that, in total, 50% of all combinations significantly increased the mortality of caged honey bees in comparison with individual application of insecticides. In contrast, none of the adjuvants alone affected bee mortality (Cox proportional hazard model, p > 0.05). With four of the five insecticide formulations, the organosilicone surfactant Break-Thru(R) S 301 significantly increased bee mortality within 72 h (for all insecticides except chlorantraniliprole). Furthermore, acetamiprid yielded the highest and second highest mortality increases from a tank mixture with the crop oil surfactant LI 700(R) (hazard ratio = 28.84, p < 0.05) and the organosilicone Break-Thru(R) S 301 (hazard ratio = 14.66, p < 0.05), respectively.

Yet much work in recent decades has shown that toxicants can injure wildlife, laboratory animals, and humans following exposures previously expected to be harmless. Additional work has shown that toxicants can act not only individually and cumulatively but also collectively and even synergistically and that they affect disadvantaged communities inordinately - and therefore, as argued by reformers, unjustly. As late as December 2016, the last full month before the inauguration of a president promising to rescind major environmental regulations, the United States federal environmental-health establishment, as led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), had not developed coherent strategies to mitigate such risks, to alert the public to their plausibility, or to advise leadership in government and industry about their implications. To understand why, we examined archival materials, reviewed online databases, read internal industry communications, and interviewed experts. We confirmed that external constraints, statutory and judicial, had been in place prior to EPA's earliest interest in mixture toxicity, but we found no overt effort, certainly no successful effort, to loosen those constraints. We also found internal constraints: concerns that fully committing to the study of complex mixtures involving numerous toxicants would lead to methodological drift within the toxicological community and that trying to act on insights from such study could lead only to regulatory futility. Interaction of these constraints, external and internal, shielded the EPA by circumscribing its responsibilities and by impeding movement toward paradigmatic adjustment, but it also perpetuated scientifically dubious policies, such as those limiting the evaluation of commercial chemical formulations, including pesticide formulations, to only those ingredients said by their manufacturers to be active. In this context, regulators' disregard of synergism contrasted irreconcilably with biocide manufacturers' understanding that synergism enhanced lethality and patent-ability. In the end, an effective national response to mixture toxicity, cumulative risk, and environmental injustice did not emerge. In parallel, though, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which was less constrained, pursued with scientific investigation what the EPA had not pursued with regulatory action."

However, the modifying effect of co-ingredients on skin uptake and glove barrier protection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to understand the role of formulation co-ingredients in skin and glove barrier protection performance against organophosphate insecticides. RESULTS We adapted standard in vitro diffusion cell methods to test permeation kinetics of two commonly used organophosphate insecticides: dimethoate and omethoate. For spray dilutions, dimethoate and omethoate did not reach breakthrough glove permeation rate (1 mu g center dot cm(-2)center dot min(-1)) and no or little skin permeation was observed for up to 8 h, regardless of formulation. For exposure conditions involving highly concentrated products, significant differences in glove permeation were observed between different formulations of dimethoate (about 1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and of omethoate (184-fold, P < 0.001). In contrast, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed between formulations in terms of skin permeation. CONCLUSION These results suggest that co-ingredients play a critical role in glove barrier protection against undiluted organophosphate insecticides, whereas their influence on skin uptake was insignificant within the exposure time tested. This implies that dermal exposure risk may vary between handling different formulated products of the same active ingredient hence recommending a common glove material for different formulations of the same chemical without careful consideration of co-ingredients and their permeation properties may not necessarily be appropriate."

The conduct of observational studies on EDCs derives from a thoughtful research question, which will help determine the subsequent methodological choices surrounding the careful selection of the study population (including the comparison group), the adequate ascertainment of exposure(s) and outcome(s) of interest, and the application of methodological and statistical concepts more specific to epidemiology. The interpretation of epidemiologic results may be arduous due to the latency occurring between EDC exposure and certain outcome (s), the complexity in capturing EDC exposure(s), and traditional methodological and statistical issues that also deserve consideration (e.g., confounding, effect modification, non-monotonic responses). Moving forward, we strongly advocate for an integrative approach of expertise in the fields of epidemiology, exposure science, risk assessment and toxicology to adequately study the health risks associated with EDCs while tackling their challenges."

To identify critical knowledge gaps about pollinators, we describe the state of knowledge about responses of pollinators and their foraging and nesting resources to historical natural disturbances and new stressors in Great Plains grasslands and riparian ecosystems. In addition, we also provide information about pollinator management and research needs to guide efforts to sustain pollinators and by extension, flowering vegetation, and other ecosystem services of grasslands. Although pollinator responses varied, pollinator specialists of disturbancesensitive plants tended to decline in response to disturbance. Management with grazing and fire overall may benefit pollinators of grasslands, depending on many factors; however, we recommend habitat and population monitoring to assess outcomes of these disturbances on small, isolated pollinator populations. The influences and interactions of drought and increasingly variable weather patterns, pesticides, and domesticated bees on pollinators are complex and understudied. Nonetheless, habitat management and restoration can reduce effects of stressors and augment floral and nesting resources for pollinators. Research needs include expanding information about 1) the distribution, abundance, trends, and intraregional variability of most pollinator species; 2) floral and nesting resources critical to support pollinators; 3) implications of different rangeland management approaches; 4) effects of missing and reestablished resources in altered and restored vegetation; and 5) disentangling the relative influence of interacting disturbances and stressors on pollinator declines.

One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations in Midwestern states is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Due to the stability of 2,4-D in aquatic environments, many non-target aquatic species experience prolonged exposure throughout critical developmental life stages that can affect essential behaviors. However, the impacts of 2,4-D exposure on learning behaviors in juvenile fish are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments using a maze environment to determine the effects of a commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulation (Weedestroy (R) AM40; WAM40; at 0.00, 0.50, 2.00, and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D acid equivalent (a.e.)) exposure on juvenile yellow perch's ability to perform a feed associated learning behavior. We observed a significant decrease in the ability of yellow perch to correctly complete the feed associated learning behavior within 200 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to controls (p = 0.0002; p < 0.0001, respectively) and within 600 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.0 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to the controls (p = 0.0107 and p 0.0001). These data suggest that exposure to 2,4-D in WAM40 can both increase the amount of time it takes for yellow perch to complete a feed associated learning behavior and/or obstruct the behavior altogether. Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p 0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch."

Glyphosate is marketed in numerous glyphosate-based herbicide formulations (GBHs) that include co-formulants to enhance herbicidal effect of the active ingredient, but are declared as inert substances. However, these other ingredients can have biologic activity on their own and may interact with the glyphosate in synergistic toxicity. In this study, we focused to compare the cytogenetic effect of the active ingredient glyphosate and three marketed GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480, and Glyfos) by investigating cytotoxicity with fluorescent co-labeling and WST-1 cell viability assay as well as genotoxicity with cytokinesis block micronucleus assay in isolated human mononuclear white blood cells. Glyphosate had no notable cytotoxic activity over the tested concentration range (0-10,000 mu M), whereas all the selected GBHs induced significant cell death from 1,000 mu M regardless of metabolic activation (S9). Micronucleus (MN) formation induced by glyphosate and its formulations at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (0-100 mu M) exhibited a diverse pattern. Glyphosate caused statistically significant increase of MN frequency at the highest concentration (100 mu M) after 20-h exposure. Contrarily, Roundup Mega exerted a significant genotoxic effect at 100 mu M both after 4- and 20-h exposures; moreover, Glyfos and Fozat 480 also resulted in a statistically significant increase of MN frequency from the concentration of 10 mu M after 4-h and 20-h treatment, respectively. The presence of S9 had no effect on MN formation induced by either glyphosate or GBHs. The differences observed in the cytotoxic and genotoxic pattern between the active principle and formulations confirm the previous concept that the presence of co-formulants in the formulations or the interaction of them with the active ingredient is responsible for the increased toxicity of herbicide products, and draw attention to the fact that GBHs are still currently in use, the toxicity of which rivals that of POEA-containing formulations (e.g., Glyfos) already banned in Europe. Hence, it is advisable to subject them to further comprehensive toxicological screening to assess the true health risks of exposed individuals, and to reconsider their free availability to any users."

In this study, we assessed both pesticide and ectoparasite effects on the physiology of a free-ranging bird.

We found that combined exposure to pesticides and Protocalliphora larvae was negatively related to haematocrit, suggesting possible synergistic effects. However, we found no such relationships with BKA and leucocyte counts, highlighting the complexity of physiological responses to multiple stressors in natural settings. Populations of several aerial insectivores are declining, and although sublethal pesticide effects on physiology are suspected, our results suggest that exposure to other factors, such as parasitism, should also be considered to fully assess these effects, especially because pesticides are increasingly present in the environment."

Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered 'bee safe' by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup(R)) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax.We used three Roundup(R) products, the consumer products Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use and Roundup(R) No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup(R) ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol(R). Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use spray bottle.Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use(R) and 30% mortality with Roundup(R) ProActive(R), over 24 hr. Weedol(R) did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup(R) No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup(R) products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup(R) products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system.These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup(R) products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited.Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems."

If dietary restriction of iodine was once a major global health concern, today, the processes of industrialization of food and high exposure to a wide variety of environmental chemicals may be affecting, directly or indirectly, thyroid function. The homeostasis of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is finely regulated through the negative feedback mechanism exerted by thyroid hormones. Allostatic mechanisms are triggered to adjust the physiology of HPT axis in chronic conditions. Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides are pesticides with controversial endocrine disrupting activities and only few studies have approached their effects on HPT axis and thyroid function. However, glyphosate has an electrophilic and nucleophilic zwitterion chemical structure that may affect the mechanisms involved in iodide oxidation and organification, as well as the oxidative phosphorylation in the ATP synthesis. Thus, in this review, we aimed to: (1) discuss the critical points in the regulation of HPT axis and thyroid hormones levels balance, which may be susceptible to the toxic action of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, correlating the molecular mechanisms involved in glyphosate toxicity described in the literature that may, directly or indirectly, be associated to the higher incidence of thyroid diseases; and (2) present the literature regarding glyphosate toxicity in HPT axis."

Our aim was to improve the sensitivity of their delta C-13 analysis and demonstrate the feasibility of measuring them in natural surface water.Methods The delta C-13 values of dissolved glyphosate and AMPA were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) (Delta V Plus instrument) coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) unit, where glyphosate and AMPA were separated on a Hypercarb column.Results We demonstrated an improved sensitivity of the delta C-13 analysis for glyphosate and AMPA by LC/IRMS compared with previous studies. For waters from the carbonate and silicate hydrofacies, while no pretreatment was required for the isotope analysis of glyphosate, removal by H3PO4 acidification of dissolved inorganic carbon, that co-elutes with AMPA, was required prior to its analysis. We successfully tested a freeze-drying pre-concentration method showing no associated isotope fractionation up to concentration factors of 500 and 50 for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively.Conclusions We demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of measuring the delta C-13 values of glyphosate and AMPA in natural surface waters with contrasted hydrofacies (calcium carbonate and silicate types). This opens new fields in pesticide research, especially on the characterization of processes that control their degradation and the production of their secondary byproducts."

In recent years, outbreaks involving these arboviruses have occurred, for which vaccines do not exist; therefore, disease prevention is only through vector control and personal protection. Aedes aegypti are present on every inhabited island within the Florida Keys. The resistance status of Ae. aegypti in the Florida Keys was assessed to guide knowledge of the best choice of chemical for use during an outbreak. Mosquito eggs were collected using ovitraps placed on Key West, Stock Island, Vaca Key, Upper Matecumbe Key, Plantation Key, and Key Largo. Bottle bioassays were conducted at the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District using Biomist (R) 30+30 (Clarke Mosquito Control Products, Inc., Roselle, IL). Further bottle testing using malathion and permethrin occurred at the CDC, Fort Collins, CO, in addition to molecular and biochemical assays. Levels of resistance varied between islands with different underlying mechanisms present. Resistance was seen to Biomist (R) 30+30 but not to permethrin, indicating that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) or the inert ingredients may be involved in resistance. No study has been conducted to date examining the role of PBO in resistance. Key Largo was treated the most with adulticides and expressed the highest levels of alpha and beta esterases, oxidases, glutathione-S-transferases, and frequency of the V1016I knockdown mutation from all sites tested. Knowledge of localized resistance and underlying mechanisms helps in making rational decisions in selection of appropriate and effective insecticides.Control of mosquitoes is important because of their ability to spread disease, their impact on local economies, and the low tolerance of the public to high numbers of biting mosquitoes. In the absence of vaccines, vector control and/or personal protection remain the mainstays for the prevention of infection with pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes. Organized vector control programs and personal protection strategies rely on the use of insecticides to varying degrees. Vector"

We deployed passive water samplers and collected riverine and estuarine bivalves Margaritifera falcata, Mya arenaria, and Crassostrea gigas from Oregon Coast watersheds to examine forestry-specific pesticide contamination. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling and regression to relate concentrations and types of pesticide contamination across watersheds to ownership and management metrics. In bivalve samples collected from eight coastal watersheds, we measured twelve unique pesticides (two herbicides; three fungicides; and seven insecticides). Pesticides were detected in 38% of bivalve samples; and frequency and maximum concentrations varied by season, species, and watershed with indaziflam (herbicide) the only current-use forestry pesticide detected.

The two formulation types differ in their active ingredient release and presumed environmental impact. In order to cover different ecological traits, two species of aquatic macrophytes - the floating monocot Lemna minor and the rooted dicot Myriophyllum aquaticum, were used as test models. The results of this study revealed differences in the sensitivity of tested plants to clomazone. Based on the most sensitive parameters, M. aquaticum proved to be more sensitive than L. minor to the technical ingredient and both formulations. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach that was tried out in an attempt to create a higher tier step of risk assessment of clomazone for primary producers indicates that tests on rooted macrophytes can add value in risk assessment of plant protection products. The capsule formulation of clomazone was less toxic than the emulsion for L. minor, but more toxic for M. aquaticum. The most toxic for L. minor was the emulsifiable concentrate formulation Rampa (R) EC, followed by technical clomazone (EC50 33.3 and 54.0 mg a.i./l, respectively), while the aqueous capsule suspension formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS did not cause adverse effects.

In Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries there are over 300 million children living under the threat of neurodevelopmental delays due to toxic environmental exposure. Large industrial centers, intense mining and agricultural activities, along with changing complex ecosystems constitute a mosaic that drives contamination of air, water and the food chain. Neurotoxic contaminants such as pesticides (organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and manganese fungicides), chemicals of industrial use (phthalates), and metals (Hg, Pb, Al, As, F, Cd, Mo, Mn) are at the center of environmental exposure studies. Exposure to neurotoxic substances singly or in combination with other compounds or socioeconomic stressors (maternal education, socio-economic and nutritional status) intertwined with occupational and para-occupational exposure can affect ND (motor, cognition, behavior) of children. Significant negative effects of pesticides and neurotoxic elements on ND were found in all studied countries, affecting especially the less-privileged children from laboring families. Studies showed that exposures to the neurotoxicants in human milk are secondary to their more lasting effects during prenatal exposure. This review integrates exposure (prenatal and breastfeeding), metabolism, and ND effects of neurotoxicants. It highlights the overwhelming evidence showing that current levels of exposures are hazardous and detrimental to children's ND in LAC countries. The evidence indicates that a reduction in neurotoxicant exposure is essential to protect children's ND.

Accordingly, recommendations to reduce pesticide risk through a combination of reforms at the policy level and its tools, particularly legislation, are proposed. In our opinion, the starting point is to adopt a minimum list of lower risk pesticides supported by a combination of: prescriptions based on a comprehensive registration and an effective implementation systems, a suitable IPM/ICM government-supported credit system, traceability systems of agricultural commodities and pesticides containers, Pesticide stock management system to reduce the quantity of obsolete pesticides, and containers recycling system. For a global sustainability of pesticides risk reduction, a binding global intervention fostered by the UN, based on human rights for safe food, is called upon to ban hazardous pesticides-except those of WHO class IV- trafficking in developing countries scoring low in an international official assessment of their pesticides lifecycle management.

Sanshools, which are well known as spices, are N-alkyl substituted compounds extracted from the Zanthoxylum species and have several essential physiological and pharmacological functions. Sanshools display excellent safener activity for the herbicide metolachlor in rice seedlings. However, the high cost of sanshools extraction and difficulties in the synthesis of their complicated chemical structures limit their utilization in agricultural fields. Thus, the present study designed and synthesized various N-alkyl amide derivatives via the scaffold-hopping strategy to solve the challenge of complicated structures and find novel potential safeners for the herbicide metolachlor. In total, 33 N-alkyl amide derivatives (2a-k, 3a-k, and 4a-k) were synthesized using amines and saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as starting materials through acylation and condensation. The identity of all the target compounds was well confirmed by H-1-NMR, C-13-NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The primary evaluation of safener activities for the compounds by the agar method indicated that most of the target compounds could protect rice seedlings from injury caused by metolachlor. Notably, compounds 2k and 4k displayed excellent herbicide safener activities on plant height and demonstrated relatively similar activities to the commercialized compound dichlormid. Moreover, we showed that compounds 2k and 4k had higher glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities in rice seedlings, compared to the metolachlor treatment. In particular, 2k and 4k are safer for aquatic organisms than dichlormid. Results from the current work exhibit that compounds 2k and 4k have excellent crop safener activities toward rice and can, thus, be promising candidates for further structural optimization in rice protection."

Benoxacor was depleted in incubations with active microsomes in the presence and absence of NADPH, suggesting its metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and microsomal carboxylesterases (CESs). Benoxacor was depleted in cytosolic incubations in the presence of glutathione, consistent with its metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). The depletion of benoxacor was faster in incubations with cytosol from male than female rats, whereas no statistically significant sex differences were observed in microsomal incubations. The consumption of benoxacor was inhibited by the CYP inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole, the CES inhibitor benzil, and the GST inhibitor ethacrynic acid. Estimates of the intrinsic clearance of benoxacor suggest that CYPs are the primary metabolic enzyme responsible for benoxacor metabolism in rats. Microsomal incubations showed an enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer (E-1-benoxacor). A greater enrichment occurred in incubations with microsomes from female (EF = 0.67 +/- 0.01) than male rats (EF = 0.60 +/- 0.01).

However, the toxicity and mode of action of ICM on insects are still not clear. In this article, the larva and neuronal cell (AW1) ofHelicoverpa zeawere used to clarify the insecticidal activity of ICM as well as its toxic mechanism at the cellular level. RESULTS The results confirmed that ICM has potential toxicity againstH. zeabothin vivoandin vitrovia time- and dose-dependent manners. Moreover, we found that ICM caused DNA damage and increased the levels of gamma H2AX and OGG1 in AW1 cells. Results also showed decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 expression resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3/9, and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) as a result of exposure to ICM.

Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures.

We reported a possible genomic damage induced by glyphosate on larvae ofL. dispar. For the first time, a MN assay was used in order to evaluate the genomic damage on a phytophagous invertebrate at the larval stage. Increased levels of MNi reflect a condition of genomic instability that can result in reduced vitality and in an increased risk of local extinction. Therefore, farmland management compatible with wildlife conservation is needed."

Since 2006, US beekeepers have lost an average of one-third of their colonies each year. Though a number of factors influence bee health, beekeepers, researchers and policymakers cite pesticides as a primary contributor. In the US, pesticide registration is overseen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the required tests conducted by chemical companies applying for registration. Until 2016, the EPA only required chemical companies to measure acute toxicity for non-target species, which means that many pesticides with sublethal toxicities are not labeled bee-toxic, and farmers can apply them without penalty while bees are on their farms or orchards. In addition, California state and county regulators will typically only investigate a bee kill caused by a labeled bee-toxic pesticide, and so emergent data on non-labeled, sublethal pesticides goes uncollected. These gaps in data collection frustrate beekeepers and disincentivize them from reporting colony losses to regulatory agencies - thus reinforcing ignorance about which chemicals are toxic to bees. I term the iterative cycle of non-knowledge co-constituted by regulatory shortfalls and stakeholder regulatory disengagement an 'ignorance loop'. I conclude with a discussion of what this dynamic can tell us about the politics of knowledge production and pesticide governance and the consequences of 'ignorance loops' for stakeholders and the environment."

D. magna neonates were exposed for 96 h to Kraft (2, 4, and 6 ng a.i./L) and Score (12.5, 25, and 50 mu g a.i./L) for the biochemical experiments, and for 15 days to abamectin (1-5 ng a.i./L) and to difenoconazole (3.12-50 mu g a.i./L) to assess possible changes in reproduction. Exposures of organisms to both single compounds did not cause effects to antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, except for LPO occurring at the highest concentration of difenoconazole tested. For ChE and CAT there was enzymatic induction in mixture treatments organisms, occurring at minor pesticides concentrations for CAT and at the two highest concentrations for ChE. There were no significant differences for total protein in D. magna but lipids showed an increase at the highest concentrations of pesticide mixture combinations. There was a significant increase of Ec in individuals of all treatments tested. In the chronic test, increased fecundity occurred for D. magna under difenoconazole exposures and mixtures. This study demonstrated that mixtures of these pesticides caused greater toxicity to D. magna than when tested individually, except for Ec. Therefore, effects of mixtures are very hard to predict only based on information from single compounds, which most possibly is the result of biological complexity and redundancy in response pathways, which need further experimentation to become better known."

Sertoli cell cultures from 20-day-old rats were exposed to 10 and 100 ppm of G or R, doses which do not decrease cell viability. Neither G nor R caused impairment in lactate production or fatty acid oxidation. G and R decreased Transepithelial Electrical Resistance, which indicates the establishment of a Sertoli cell junction barrier. However, neither G nor R modified the expression of claudin11, ZO1 and occludin, proteins that constitute the BTB. Analysis of cellular distribution of claudin11 by immunofluorescence showed that G and R induced a delocalization of the signal from membrane to the cytoplasm. The results suggest that G and R could alter an important function of Sertoli cell such as BTB integrity and thus they could compromise the normal development of spermatogenesis."

While multiple studies have documented the toxicity, environmental persistence, and tendency to spread for glyphosate and Roundup (R), few studies have compared the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations to the toxicity of pure glyphosate for soil invertebrates, which contact both the herbicide and the formulations. Hundreds of formulations exist; their inert ingredients are confidential; and glyphosate persists in our food, water, and soil. In this experiment, we held glyphosate type and concentration constant, varying only formulation. Using Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R), Roundup Super Concentrate (R), and pure glyphosate, we delivered 26.3 mg glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt per kg of soil to compost worms (Eisenia fetida). We found that worms living in soil spiked with pure glyphosate lost 14.8-25.9% of their biomass and survived a stress test for 22.2-333% less time than worms living in uncontaminated soil. Worms living in soil spiked with Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R) and Roundup Super Concentrate (R) did not lose body mass and survived the stress test as well as worms living in uncontaminated soil. No contaminant affected soil microbial or fungal biomass over the 40-day period of this experiment. We suggest that the nitrates and phosphates in the formulations offset the toxic effects of glyphosate by spurring microbial growth and speeding glyphosate degradation. We also found a 26.5-41.3% reduction in fungal biomass across all treatments over the course of this experiment, suggesting that the worms consumed fungi and spores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the need for the assessment of health and environmental hazards deriving from the interactions between various substances found in commercial pesticide formulations is becoming increasingly recognized, the approval of pesticide products is still mostly limited to determining the toxicity of the individual ingredients ignoring the possible combined effects in mixtures. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature of in vitro and in vivo studies that simultaneously examine the toxicity of pesticide product formulations and their declared active ingredients to compare their toxicity to human health and to the environment.Two electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the health effects of active pesticide ingredients and their product formulations. The literature search was performed with a combination of the following terms: pesticide, formulation, commercial product, commercial pesticide and health. After screening by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and reliability assessment of eligible publications was conducted by use of the ToxRTool. Two investigators independently screened the identified publications and extracted results from eligible studies.Our search yielded 36 toxicity studies; 23 studies investigated herbicides, 15 examined insecticides and 4 focused on fungicides. Twenty-four studies reported increased toxicity of the product formulations versus their active ingredients, which, in most cases, were attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the formulations. A significant number (n = 10) of studies focused on the comparative testing of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, and six of them concluded that Roundup, the dominant product formulation of glyphosate, is more toxic than the active ingredient alone. We identified only 8 studies demonstrating reduced toxicity of product formulations in relation to the active ingredient that might be due to a potential antagonistic effect between the constituents.The results of this review demonstrate the inadequacy of current EU testing requirements for assessing the health hazards of pesticide product formulations based mainly on the evaluation of the individual ingredients and of at least one representative use and formulation. Ignoring the possible risks deriving from the interaction between the active and other ingredients of various commercial pesticide product formulations might result in the misinterpretation of its toxicological profile. At EU level efforts are currently made to address this issue. In this context, we recommend that all product formulations should be fully assessed during the authorization process."

To prepare the solvent, dichloroacetic acid, l-menthol, and n-butanol are mixed at a molar ratio of 4:1:1 and the deep eutectic solvent is formed after heating. Then a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method using the prepared solvent is used for the extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides from an aqueous sample. To carry out the procedure, the deep eutectic solvent is mixed with methanol and rapidly injected by a syringe into the aqueous sample containing the analytes. After centrifuging, an aliquot of the sedimented phase is injected into the gas chromatograph. The influence of several variables on the extraction efficiency was investigated and optimized. RESULTS Extraction recoveries and enrichment factors were obtained in the ranges of 53-86% and 1760-2853, respectively. The intra- (n = 6) and inter-day (n = 5) precision of the method was satisfactory, with relative standard deviations <= 7% obtained at two concentrations of 10 and 50 mu g L-1 of each analyte. Moreover, detection and quantification limits for the target analytes were obtained in the ranges of 0.11-0.23 and 0.38-0.74 mu g L-1, respectively. CONCLUSION Different samples, including green tea, rose water, lemon balm, mint, and pussy willow distillates were analyzed successfully using the method that was developed, and chlorpyrifos was found in rose water at a concentration of 17 +/- 1 mu g L-1 (n = 3).

While multiple factors are implicated, there is uncertainty surrounding the contribution of certain groups of pesticides to losses in wild and managed bees. Nanotechnology-based pesticides (NBPs) are formulations based on multiple particle sizes and types. By packaging active ingredients in engineered particles, NBPs offer many benefits and novel functions, but may also exhibit different properties in the environment when compared with older pesticide formulations. These new properties raise questions about the environmental disposition and fate of NBPs and their exposure to pollinators. Pollinators such as honey bees have evolved structural adaptations to collect pollen, but also inadvertently gather other types of environmental particles which may accumulate in hive materials. Knowledge of the interaction between pollinators, NBPs, and other types of particles is needed to better understand their exposure to pesticides, and essential for characterizing risk from diverse environmental contaminants.

This is the first study to investigate and compare the cyto- and genotoxic potential of the active ingredient glyphosate and GBHs in human mononuclear white blood (HMWB) cells.HMWB cells were treated for 4 h at 37 degrees C with increasing concentrations (1-1000 mu M) of glyphosate alone and in three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) to test cytotoxic effect with fluorescent colabelling and genotoxic effect with comet assay. In addition, each concentration was tested with and without metabolic activation using human liver S9 fraction.We found that glyphosate alone does not induce significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity over the tested concentration range. Contrarily, GBHs induced statistically significant cell death from 250 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 500 mu M (Fozat 480), as well as statistically significant increase of DNA damage from 500 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 750 mu M (Fozat 480); however, the latter observation may not be explained by direct DNA injuries, rather due to the high level of cell death (> 70%) exerted by the formulations. Metabolic activation significantly increased the DNA damage levels induced by Glyfos, but not of the other GBHs and of glyphosate.The differences observed in the toxic pattern of formulations and the active principle may be attributed to the higher cytotoxic activity of other ingredients in the formulations or to the interaction of them with the active ingredient glyphosate.

Alternative management practices such as conservation agriculture could be expected to ensure sustainability of ecosystem services from Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. Conservation agriculture is characterized by minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and diversification of crop species. We analyzed the impacts of several forms of alternative agricultural management practices (conservation tillage, cover cropping, mulching, manual weed management, organic fertilizer use, no-irrigation system) on multiple ecosystem services based on 155 published case studies (1994-2015). The effect size of various management options on four provisioning and four regulating ecosystem services were quantified. Impacts of conservation management options are not uniform. All regulating services were positively affected by the conservation management options except for the system without irrigation. In contrast, the provisioning services were inconsistently influenced by the conservation management options. For crop yield, environmentally sustainable soil management was beneficial, but organic fertilization (effect size = - 0.17), manual weed management (effect size = - 0.35), and no-irrigation system (effect size = - 0.5) led to lower crop yields. The impact on crop biomass was mainly negative but not significant. Water availability was especially important to enhance both provisioning and regulating services. Overall, alternative agriculture management practices led to more positive than negative effects on ecosystem services in the study region. Stimulating the application of conservation management practices is therefore an important policy option for decision-makers given the vulnerability of ecosystem services in the Mediterranean basin."

Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here.

However, an EQS may vary with time and between countries with shared water bodies, challenging coherent risk management. This study aimed to analyze the underlying reasons for changes in EQS values following a revision of previously derived EQSs for 62 substances. Relevant data were retrieved from publicly accessible databases, available literature, registration dossiers, and, in some cases, provided by manufacturers. Ecotoxicological data were assessed regarding reliability and relevance. As in previous studies, EQS derivation followed the European Union guideline. Overall, 61 annual average EQSs (AA-EQS) and 58 maximum acceptable concentration EQSs (MAC-EQS) were derived. Size and completeness of data sets generally increased due to the revision. AA-EQSs increased in 13 cases and decreased in 21 cases. MAC-EQSs increased in 22 cases and decreased in 11 cases. Most EQSs were derived using the deterministic assessment factor (AF) method. The number of substances for which EQSs were derived probabilistically by reference to the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method increased from 2 to 5 AA-EQSs and from 6 to 11 MAC-EQSs. For AA-EQS derivation, AFs were reduced in 14 cases and increased in 6 cases. For MAC-EQS derivation, AFs were reduced in 9 cases and increased in 2 cases. Results demonstrate that the revisions did not generally lead to either lower or higher EQSs. The majority of EQSs (>93%) changed less than 10-fold. Clearly, EQSs based on small or incomplete data sets with large AFs were more prone to considerable changes in their numeric values when revised than EQSs based on SSDs. Thus, revision can reduce uncertainty and increase robustness of an EQS. In this study, however, available data continued to be insufficient to construct SSDs for the majority of substances. This was mostly due to a lack of reliable data. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;00:1-13. (c) 2019 SETAC"

About 96 h exposure to sublethal concentrations (0, 12.0 and 25.0 mu g/L) of the commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos reduced the level of hepatic glycogen, activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase in liver and elevated the level of plasma glucose and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in O. niloticus.

However, standard sampling procedures are invasive, requiring tissue, organ or blood extraction. This leads to concerns regarding conservation practice, animal welfare and restrictions in study design. New techniques are needed to avoid these problems, but still generate reliable data. Here, we aimed at validating the use of buccal swabs as a reliable method to detect pesticide exposure in reptiles. Common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) were divided into control, dermal and oral treatment groups and exposed to different pesticide formulations. Subsequently, buccal swabs were taken and enzymatic activity was analyzed. We were able to confirm the suitability of the method to detect effects of pesticide exposure on the enzymatic level. While exposure to the formulation Roundup Ultramax (R) didn't match when compared to effects previously observed in situ when compared to other glyphosate based formulations, effects could still be detected. This can be seen as a strong indicator that the active ingredient of a formulation may not always be the mian driver for ecotoxicological effectsat the enzymatic level. At the same time, exposure towards the single formulation Vivando (R) didn't result in any effects. However, individuals residing in agricultural landscapes will mostly be exposed to pesticide mixes containing different formulations.

A narrative literature review was conducted to explore the mechanism/s of interactions between greenhouse characteristics and occupational pesticide exposure. Using a work, worker and workplace conceptual framework, the greenhouse environment (hot and humid microclimate, limited space and dense crop arrangements) combines with work characteristics (high work and pesticide use intensity, multi-tasking, predominantly manual spraying techniques and quick reentry to treated farms) to potentially increase occupational pesticide exposure, compared with open field farming. Greenhouse environments, are variable but have been shown to influence pesticide availability, route, pathways and frequency of exposure, deposition and distribution on a worker's body as well as use and performance of exposure control methods. Training programs can emphasize the differences in exposure potential between greenhouse and open field farming. Development of tailored guidelines for exposure control strategies to better suit the level of uniqueness of greenhouse agriculture seems warranted."

Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEM were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are 100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted. Research to understand health implications from ingesting these substances is required."

All active pyrethroids negatively affected embryonic development at 1000 mu M concentration. Decreased quality of obtained blastocysts in permethrin, fenvalerate and lambda-cyhalothrin-treated embryos was revealed as well. Deltamethrin showed harmful impact on embryo development at 100 mu M concentration.

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R), and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival."

This poisoning is a highly fatal condition that requires a rapid and precise diagnosis for adequate treatment. However, various studies on mortality predictor factors have been insufficient for whole pesticide treatments. We hypothesized that the initial plasma anion gap (AG) and base deficit (BD) are reliable prognostic factors. Methods: A retrospective study analyzed 561 patients with a diagnosis of acute pesticide poisoning between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2017. The initial AG and BD values were divided into quartiles according to the number of patients. Survival at 30 days from admission was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn, and the areas under the curve for AG and BD for mortality were calculated. Results: Fifty-eight (10.3%) of 561 patients died within 30 days. The highest AG quartile (>22 mEq/L) was associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital mortality. Compared to patients with an AG less than 14.7 mEq/L, these patients had a 4.18-fold higher risk of 30-day hospital mortality and the highest BD quartile (>7.9 mEq/L) was associated with an increased risk of 30-day hospital mortality. Compared to patients with a BD less than 1.4 mEq/L, these patients had 2.23-fold higher risk of 30-day hospital mortality. The areas under the ROC for AG and BD curve were 0.699 and 0.744, respectively. Conclusions: Initial high AG and BD values could predict mortality and require precise intensive care."

Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (gamma-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of gamma-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free gamma-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 mu g/L, 0.57 mu g/L, and 0.65 mu g/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of gamma-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner. Recognizing the analytical and toxicological nuances of various nanosized capsules can contribute to innovation in pesticide formulations and may lead to more comprehensive pesticide regulation."

One of these factors is the use of insecticides to protect plants from pests. However, apart from the targeted pest insects, thousands of non-target organisms face traces of insecticides that are not lethal but can affect numerous traits of the individual, including development, physiology, behaviour and communication. In the present review, key facts on impacts of sublethal insecticide exposure on such traits are summarised. Attributable to various abiotic and biotic processes, insecticide concentrations may become sublethal in space and time. Nevertheless, these concentrations impede insect development, reducing growth and survival, but sometimes also enhance reproductive performance. The effects are species-specific, but sensitivity also differs within species depending on the developmental stage, sex and population. Furthermore, insecticide exposure influences several immunity pathways and causes changes in behaviour. Such changes are mostly studied on the level of behavioural traits. However, also effects on the consistency of overall individual behavioural phenotypes, i.e. personalities, should be investigated, which have consequences on individual fitness and on the effectiveness of biocontrol agents. Moreover, insecticides can act as info-disruptors, impeding signal production and perception during chemical communication at various levels. Finally, microbial symbionts may modify insect responses to insecticides, being of particular interest for biotechnological approaches. Here, methodological issues are discussed and knowledge gaps and potential future research directions are highlighted. Understanding the mechanisms of dose-dependent insecticide impacts on organisms and their cascading effects on higher levels of biological organisation and on subsequent generations are of utmost importance for proper insecticide use.

Experiments in vitro were conducted on whole human peripheral blood, isolated lymphocytes, and HepG2 cells exposed for 4 h to terbuthylazine at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current reference values set by the European Commission in 2011.

The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified comet assays. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of oxidative stress in vitro was studied using a battery of standard oxidative stress biomarkers. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino mice exposed to terbuthlyazine in the form of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days.

In vitro results suggested low terbuthylazine cytotoxicity in non-target cells. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced lymphocyte viability by 15%, mostly due to apoptosis, while cytotoxic effects in HepG2 cells at the same concentration were negligible. Acute in vitro exposure of human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells to terbuthylazine resulted in low-level DNA instability, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the DNA damage obtained using the hOGG1-modified comet assay indicated that oxidative DNA damage did not prevail in the overall damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of oxidative stress markers, which were mostly comparable to control. Results obtained in mice indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of terbuthylazine produced DNA instability in all of the studied cell types. We found that DNA in liver and kidney cells was more prone to direct toxic effects of the parent compound and its metabolites than DNA in leukocytes and bone marrow cells. The overall findings suggest the formation of reactive terbuthylazine metabolites capable of inducing DNA cross-links, which hinder DNA migration. These effects were most pronounced in liver cells in vivo and HepG2 cells in vitro. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional research is needed. Nevertheless, the present study provides evidence that terbuthylazine at concentrations comparable with current reference values possesses toxicological risk because it caused low-level DNA instability, both at cellular and animal organism level, which should be further established in forthcoming studies."

However, the general intensive use of insecticides has reduced the numbers of this parasitoid. This study evaluated the effect of the residual action of 24 insecticides on T. radiata and also determined the differential toxicity of insecticides to D. citri and T. radiata, using three bioassays. In the first, when adults of the parasitoid were exposed to residues of the 24 insecticides, ten were considered short-life (class 1), six slightly persistent (class 2), five moderately persistent (class 3), and three insecticides were considered persistent (class 4), under the IOBC/WPRS classification system. The second bioassay evaluated the sublethal concentrations of the persistent insecticides (formetanate, dimethoate, spinosad). Increasing the concentrations of the insecticides increased the number that were classified as persistent. In the third bioassay, evaluation of the differential toxicity of eight insecticides to the ACP and the parasitoid showed that chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin were more harmful to T. radiata. Therefore, these two insecticides are not recommended for application at the time of parasitoid release. Cypermethrin, imidacloprid, and dimethoate caused higher mortality of D. citri and are most often recommended in IPM programs. The choice of an insecticide for the control of citrus pests must be made with care, aiming to preserve the natural enemies in the ecosystem, and thereby contribute to the success of biological control."

Given the likelihood of these chemicals washing into urban waterways, it is important to understand the effects that these additives may have on aquatic organisms. The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of commercially available household pesticides to that of the active ingredient(s) alone. The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600 x difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations. In addition, monitoring programmes and chemical risk assessments schemes should develop a structured approach to assessing the toxic effects of commercial formulations, including additives, rather than simply those of the listed active ingredients."

Amphibians inhabiting these valuable wetlands may be exposed to Bti products several times during their breeding season. Up until now, information regarding effects on the non-targeted group of amphibians has to be considered rather inconsistent. On this account, we evaluated how three repeated exposures to frequently used Bti formulations (VectoBac(center dot)12AS, VectoBac(center dot)WG) in field-relevant rates affect European common frog (Rana temporaria) larvae. In a laboratory approach, we assessed potential effects with regard to enzymatic biomarkers (glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), acetylcholine esterase (AChE)), development, body condition and survival until the end of metamorphosis. Although survival and time to metamorphosis were not significantly affected, larval development tended to be shortened in the Bti treated water phase. Furthermore, exposure to Bti induced significant increases of GST (37-550%), GR (5-140%) and AChE (38-137%) irrespectively of the applied formulation, indicating detoxification, antioxidant responses as well as an alteration of neuronal activity. GST activity increased twice as much after two repeatedly executed Bti applications within a time period of 6 days. The examination of several biochemical markers is needed to fully evaluate the ecotoxicological risk of Bti for amphibian populations, especially in the context of worldwide amphibian declines.

The present study showed that azadirachtin inhibited the growth of S. litura larvae, which was resulted by structure destroy and size inhibition of the midgut. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of midgut suggested that azadirachtin regulated the transcriptional level of multiple unigenes involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium apoptotic signaling pathways. Simultaneously, the expression patterns of some differentially expressed unigenes were verified by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, the enhanced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, the increased expression of caspase family members and apoptosis-binding motif 1 (IBM1) on both gene and protein level and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm were induced in midgut after azadirachtin treatment.

Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal active principle and other ingredients, with the latter collectively also known as adjuvants. These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments."

It poses a severe threat to biodiversity and conservation in temperate natural ecosystems. Pterostylis arenicola, a threatened terrestrial orchid endemic to South Australia, is directly imperilled by this weed in most of its remnant populations. The coincident growth phenologies of orchid and weed make for an ecologically sensitive environment when considering methods of weed control or eradication. To minimise impact on the orchid and its ecosystem, this paper examines the efficacy of herbicide application for A. asparagoides control using the weed wiping technique, comparing it to the conventional spray application method. The most prolonged control of A. asparagoides was achieved after a single wipe-application of 1.5 g a.i. (active ingredient) L-1 metsulfuron methyl, either alone or in combination with 120 g a.i. L-1 glyphosate, both treatments giving significantly better weed control five years after treatment than comparable spray applications. An investigation of the effect of glyphosate on cultures of the mycorrhizal fungus isolated from P. arenicola indicated a significant decline in mycelial growth with increasing herbicide concentration over the range 0.5-3.0 kg a.i. ha(-1). These results provide further incentive for the use of ecologically sensitive herbicide application techniques, such as weed wiping, in areas of high conservation concern."

To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36-48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10-20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants. Considering these new data, this assessment method appears insufficient to ensure safety. These results, taken together, shed a new light on the toxicity of these major herbicides and of pesticides in general."

Our results suggest both dermal and oral uptake of pesticide formulations, with the former being especially relevant during the first two days after a pesticide application. Enzymatic activity slightly differed between exposure gradients, while showing overall similar patterns. Body condition of lizards decreased with increasing pesticide exposure. Furthermore, gender distribution was particularly skewed in favor to males within exposed sample sites. Although reptiles are not target organisms of pesticide applications, many species do come into contact with them, and most probably suffer from dermal and oral uptake. Thus, we believe it is indispensable for reptiles to be integrated in risk assessments in order to improve conservation practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Although pesticide sensitivity comparisons between temperate and tropical freshwater organisms have indeed not revealed consistent differences, risk assessments are currently still based on a relatively small tropical toxicity dataset. In addition, greater levels of runoff and spray drift may be expected in tropical than in temperate agroecosystems, indicating that aquatic life in edge-of-field water bodies is likely to be subjected to higher concentrations of pesticides and their mixtures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxicity of Kraft 36 EC (a.i. abamectin), Score 250 EC (a.i. difenoconazole) and their mixture to the Neotropical cladoceran Macrothrixflabelligera. Laboratory toxicity tests with the individual formulated products indicated EC50-48 h values of 3.1 and 659 mu g a.i./L given as nominal test concentrations, respectively. Mixtures of the two pesticides revealed a concentration-dependent deviation of the independent action model, with antagonism at low and synergism at high pesticide mixture concentrations. Laboratory toxicity tests were also conducted with microcosm water that was treated with the individual or mixtures through runoff or direct overspray. Microcosm tanks receiving runoff water from experimental soil plots applied with recommended doses of the individual pesticides did not show toxicity to the test organism. Microcosms that received runoff water containing the pesticide mixture, however, did cause a short-term effect on immobility. The microcosms that were treated by direct overspray of both pesticide formulations showed the most pronounced toxic effects. Study findings suggest a potential risk of these pesticides at environmentally relevant concentrations, especially when they are both present. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We draw on in-depth interview data with representatives from farm groups, consumer and environmental advocacy organizations, agriculture and biotech companies, government regulatory agencies, and agricultural extension agents, together with a content analysis of websites of GE supporters and opponents. Together these data are used to explore how the problem of superweeds is being framed by proponents and opponents of GE crops, and among agricultural scientists, advocacy organizations and business. We conclude that when environmental problems associated with pesticide resistance are 'scaled up' to incorporate more systemic agricultural issues and are linked with broader socio-economic and political issues that impact a larger public, there are greater possibilities for pushing for government intervention and regulation to address environmental burdens and externalities.

Scientific data indicate that agricultural intensification and pesticide use are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss. The analysed data and experiences do not support statements that herbicide-resistant crops provide consistently better yields than conventional crops or reduce herbicide amounts. They rather show that the adoption of herbicide-resistant crops impacts agronomy, agricultural practice, and weed management and contributes to biodiversity loss in several ways: (i) many studies show that glyphosate-based herbicides, which were commonly regarded as less harmful, are toxic to a range of aquatic organisms and adversely affect the soil and intestinal microflora and plant disease resistance; the increased use of 2,4-D or dicamba, linked to new herbicide-resistant crops, causes special concerns. (ii) The adoption of herbicide-resistant crops has reduced crop rotation and favoured weed management that is solely based on the use of herbicides. (iii) Continuous herbicide resistance cropping and the intensive use of glyphosate over the last 20 years have led to the appearance of at least 34 glyphosate-resistant weed species worldwide. Although recommended for many years, farmers did not counter resistance development in weeds by integrated weed management, but continued to rely on herbicides as sole measure. Despite occurrence of widespread resistance in weeds to other herbicides, industry rather develops transgenic crops with additional herbicide resistance genes. (iv) Agricultural management based on broad-spectrum herbicides as in herbicide-resistant crops further decreases diversity and abundance of wild plants and impacts arthropod fauna and other farmland animals. Taken together, adverse impacts of herbicide-resistant crops on biodiversity, when widely adopted, should be expected and are indeed very hard to avoid. For that reason, and in order to comply with international agreements to protect and enhance biodiversity, agriculture needs to focus on practices that are more environmentally friendly, including an overall reduction in pesticide use. (Pesticides are used for agricultural as well non-agricultural purposes. Most commonly they are used as plant protection products and regarded as a synonym for it and so also in this text.)"

We performed a comet assay on the erythrocytes of tadpoles found in the surroundings of agricultural fields (soybean and corn crops), where there is an intense release of several kinds of pesticides in different quantities. We aimed to detect differences in the genotoxic parameters between populations collected from soybeans and cornfields, and between them and tadpoles sampled from non-agricultural areas (control group). Tadpoles collected from ponds located at soybean fields had significantly more DNA damage, followed by tadpoles collected from cornfields. In contrast, animals sampled from non-agricultural areas had the lowest incidence of DNA damage. In addition, we found a negative correlation between the parameters of the comet assay and the area of the ponds surrounding soybean. This correlation indicates a possible dilution effect in the concentration of pesticides. Finally, Physalaemus cuvieri Fitzinger, 1826 seems to be a good bioindicator for detecting the genotoxic effects of field agricultural insecticides; therefore, we suggest that this species should be used in environmental biomonitoring studies, since it is common and abundant where it occurs."

The resulting species and population declines affect all vertebrates including reptiles. Especially in industrialized countries, pollution by agrochemicals is of remarkable importance. Here, habitat loss has historically been associated with expansion of agriculture. Species persisting in such environments do not only need to cope with habitat loss, but more recently, also with chemical intensification, namely pesticide exposure. In this study, we examined effects of different fungicide and herbicide applications on the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in grape-growing areas. We used three enzymatic biomarkers (GST, GR, AChE) and for the first time saliva from buccal swabs as a minimal invasive sampling method for detection. Our results demonstrate absorption of substances by lizards and effects of pesticide exposure on enzymatic activities. Our findings are in accordance with those of previous laboratory studies, although samples were retrieved from natural habitats.

Identifying novel active ingredients and improving the delivery system of a pesticide are the main challenges in developing new pesticides. Strategies for the control of delivery systems for slow and sustained release of agrochemicals are of great interest to environmental scientists. In this context, the selection of materials to be used as carrier agents in pesticide formulations is crucial. In recent years, the efficacy of several materials for agrochemical formulations has been evaluated by researchers. These materials have unique properties, such as being biodegradable and biocompatible, and having low toxicity and involving a simple preparation process. This review summarises recent applications of various materials in pesticide formulations. The application of the materials can effectively encapsulate or bind the pesticide's active ingredients in the material's matrix with a sustained release profile and slow mobility in soil.

Moreover, the development and diversity of these aquatic organisms could also be affected by human-induced climate change that might lead to more periods with extreme temperatures. However, to what extent non-target effects of these herbicides on amphibians or algae are altered by varying temperature is not well known.Methods: We studied effects of five concentrations of the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup PowerFlex (0, 1.5, 3, 4 mg acid equivalent glyphosate L-1 as a one time addition and a pulse treatment of totally 4 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1) on larval development of Common toads (Bufo bufo, L.; Amphibia: Anura) and associated algae communities under two temperature regimes (15 vs. 20 degrees C).Results: Herbicide contamination reduced tail growth (-8%), induced the occurrence of tail deformations (i.e. lacerated or crooked tails) and reduced algae diversity (-6%). Higher water temperature increased tadpole growth (tail and body length (tl/bl) +66%, length-to-width ratio +4%) and decreased algae diversity (-21%). No clear relation between herbicide concentrations and tadpole growth or algae density or diversity was observed. Interactive effects of herbicides and temperature affected growth parameters, tail deformation and tadpole mortality indicating that the herbicide effects are temperature-dependent. Remarkably, herbicide-temperature interactions resulted in deformed tails in 34% of all herbicide treated tadpoles at 15 degrees C whereas no tail deformations were observed for the herbicide-free control at 15 degrees C or any tadpole at 20 degrees C; herbicide-induced mortality was higher at 15 degrees C but lower at 20 degrees C.Discussion: These herbicide-and temperature-induced changes may have decided effects on ecological interactions in freshwater ecosystems. Although no clear dose-response effect was seen, the presence of glyphosate was decisive for an effect, suggesting that the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) in our study was 1.5 mg a.e. glyphosate L-1 water. Overall, our findings also question the relevance of pesticide risk assessments conducted at standard temperatures."

Previous investigations have reported the apoptotic effects of azadirachtin on some insect cells, but the molecular mechanisms are still not clear. This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms for the apoptotic effects induced by azadirachtin on Drosophila melanogasterS2 cells in vitro.RESULTSThe results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay demonstrated that azadirachtin exhibited significant cytotoxicity to S2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The changes in cellular morphology and the DNA fragmentation demonstrated that azadirachtin induced remarkable apoptosis of S2 cells. Expression levels of 276 genes were found to be significantly changed in S2 cells after exposure to azadirachtin, as detected by Drosophila genome array. Among these genes, calmodulin (CaM) was the most highly upregulated gene. Azadirachtin was further demonstrated to trigger intracellular Ca2+ release in S2 cells. The genes related to the apoptosis pathway, determined from chip data, were validated by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.CONCLUSIONThe results showed that azadirachtin-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release was the primary event that triggered apoptosis in Drosophila S2 cells through both pathways of the Ca2+-CaM and EcR/Usp signalling cascade.

The lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata is an important beneficial insect in cropland that is commonly used as an indicator species in safety evaluations of pesticides. Here, we examined the lethal and non-lethal effects of 2,4-D and dicamba active ingredients and commercial formulations to this lady beetle species, and tested for synergistic effects of the herbicides. Second instars of lady beetles were exposed to an experimental treatment, and their mortality, development, weight, sex ratio, fecundity, and mobility was evaluated. Using similar methods, a dose-response study was conducted on 2,4-D with and without dicamba. The commercial formulation of 2,4-D was highly lethal to lady beetle larvae; the LC90 of this herbicide was 13 % of the label rate. In this case, the inactive ingredients were a key driver of the toxicity. Dicamba active ingredient significantly increased lady beetle mortality and reduced their body weight. The commercial formulations of both herbicides reduced the proportion of males in the lady beetle population. The herbicides when used together did not act synergistically in their toxicity toward lady beetles versus when the chemistries were used independently. Our work shows that herbicide formulations can cause both lethal and sublethal effects on non-target, beneficial insects, and these effects are sometimes driven by the inactive ingredients.

Both contain different compositions of so-called inert ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O-2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate ((V)over dot O-2 - mLO(2) Kg1 h(-1)) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) (V)over dot O-2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O-2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced (V)over dot O-2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O-2 diffusion distance to O-2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased (V)over dot O-2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of inert compounds and surfactants. (V)over dot O-2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in (V)over dot O-2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term exposures of Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina to Betanal (R) Expert, to each a.i. and to a customised mixture matching the a.i.s ratio within the commercial formulation were carried out, and deleterious effects in the offspring were recorded. This intended to clarify whether (1) the tested compounds induce reproductive injury; (2) there is interspecific variation in daphnids tolerance to the compounds; (3) there is an interaction between chemicals in combined treatments; and (4) the so-called inert ingredients added to the commercial formulation contribute to the toxicity of the herbicide.

Ethofumesate was invariably the least toxic pesticide, and D. magna tended to be of slightly higher sensitivity to the exposures compared to D. longispina. Joint exposures indicated that the a.i.s can interact, inducing more than and less than additive effects for Betanal (R) Expert and the customised a.i. mixture, respectively. This indicates that inert ingredients co-formulating the commercial pesticide (which are absent from the customised a.i. mixture) actually contribute to its overall toxicity. This study constitutes an add-on to the discussion on the ecotoxicological framework required for authorisation of pesticide trade and usage. The results support the need to consider test species, long-term hazardous potential and toxicity of commercial formulations rather than solely that of active ingredients, as relevant variables in pesticide regulation."

Our observations strongly suggest that the cytotoxic effects observed after Twin Pack Gold (R) exposure are due to the excipients contained within the technical formulation rather than FLC itself.

Herein, we review what is known about the uses, physicochemical properties, environmental transformations, and (eco)toxicological effects of dichloroacetamide safeners, which represent one of the most commonly used safener classes (estimated use of >2 x 10(6) kg/year in the United States). We particularly highlight transformation pathways that may enhance biological activity and/or persistence; for example, limited studies suggest dichloroacetamides can transform via dechlorination into products with increased bioactivity. We also identify several research needs to improve our understanding of the environmental fate and potential risks of this overlooked agrochemical class, which in turn will enhance the efficacy and safety of future herbicide safener formulations."

We have studied R effects (containing 36 % of G) on right ventricular tissues (male Sprague-Dawley rats, up to 20,000 ppm and female New Zealand rabbits, at 25 and 50 ppm), to investigate R cardiac electrophysiological actions in vitro. We tested the reduced Ca++ intracellular uptake mechanism as one potential cause of the electrical abnormalities after GBH superfusion, using the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain or the 1,4-dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 which increases I (Ca). R concentrations were selected based on human blood ranges found after acute intoxication. The study showed dose-dependent V (max), APD(50) and APD(90) variations during 45 min of R superfusion. At the highest concentrations tested, there was a high incidence of conduction blocks, and 30-min washout with normal Tyrode solution did not restore excitability. We also observed an increased incidence of arrhythmias at different doses of R. Ouabain and BAY K 8644 prevented V (max) decrease, APD(90) increase and the cardiac inexcitability induced by R 50 ppm. Glyphosate alone (18 and 180 ppm) had no significant electrophysiological effects. Thus, the action potential prolonging effect of R pointing to I (Ca) interference might explain both conduction blocks and proarrhythmia in vitro. These mechanisms may well be causative of QT prolongation, atrioventricular conduction blocks and arrhythmias in man after GBH acute intoxications as reported in retrospective hospital records."

Altered transcription levels of liver vitellogenin (vtg) have been documented in wild populations of 2 Great Barrier Reef fisheries species and were strongly associated with pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations. The present study examined endocrine and physiological biomarkers in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of commercial herbicide (ATRADEX((R)) WG Herbicide, DIUREX (R) WG Herbicide) and surfactant (ACTIVATOR((R)) 90) formulations commonly used on sugarcane in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. Estrogenic biomarkers (namely, liver vtg messenger RNA and plasma 17-estradiol) increased following exposure to commercial mixtures but not to the analytical grade chemical, suggesting an estrogenic response to the additives. In contrast, brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) transcription levels, plasma testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone concentrations, and gill ventilation rates were not affected by any of the experimental exposures. These findings support the assertion that exposure to pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations is a potential causative agent of altered liver vtg transcription levels in wild barramundi. Whether exposure patterns in the Great Barrier Reef catchment and lagoon are sufficient to impair fish sexual and reproductive development and ultimately influence fish population dynamics remains to be determined.

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if 'the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison'. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Chronic toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC on P. roseola survival and fecundity were also studied. The sensitivity of P. roseola to K2Cr2O7 ranged from 29.52 to 64.67 mg L-1, averaging 47.10 mg L-1. The 48-h EC50 were 13.36 +/- 2.63 mg L-1 for carbofuran and 89.32 +/- 6.52 mg L-1 for commercial form. Chronic toxicity tests showed that the survival of this rotifer was not affected by the carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC at the concentrations tested and that at 1.56 and 3.12 mg L-1 their fecundity was higher than in the absence of this commercial product, characterizing the hormesis phenomenon. The sensitivity profile of several species to carbofuran indicated that P. roseola is more susceptible to this pesticide than the fish Clarias batrachus, the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, although the acute toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC to P. roseola is much lower than that of active ingredient carbofuran. The results also imply that the exacerbated use of pesticides and the constant, accelerated expansion of agricultural activity will make aquatic non-target species even more vulnerable. Furthermore, the relevant role of benthic organisms in aquatic environments justifies the inclusion of P. roseola and other benthic species in toxicity screening for risk assessment, regarding this environmental compartment."

We conducted an ecotoxicology experiment to examine the interaction between predator-induced stress and one of three common mosquito insecticide formulations (Mosquito Dunks, Mosquito Bits, and Mosquito Torpedoes) on the performance of Gray Treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles and changes in aquatic communities in pond mesocosms. Then, to describe the extent to which each product was applied in the region surrounding our study area, we conducted a survey of mosquito insecticide practices by individuals who owned or managed property within U.S. Environmental Protection Agency region seven. When applied in the presence of predators, Mosquito Torpedo use resulted in the lowest tadpole survival rates. Mosquito Dunks also reduced tadpole survival when applied in the context of predators (P = 0.06), and Mosquito Bits had no effect on tadpole survival. Of land managers who applied a mosquito insecticide, 5% used Mosquito Bits, 5% used Mosquito Torpedoes, and 81% used Mosquito Dunks.

Laboratory trials showed small differences between the insecticides, whereas field cage trials gave more information on toxicity and persistence of the three pyrethroids. The most toxic and with good persistence on plants was alpha-cypermethrin, followed by lambda-cyhalothrin, which had an intermediate persistence. By contrast, tau-fluvalinate showed a high persistence on plants, but seemed unsuited for wheat bug control because of its low toxicity, as clearly demonstrated in both laboratory and semi-field trials. The results provide clear information on the application strategy of the tested pyrethroids.

Significant development has taken place in terms of the fundamental understanding of the transport mechanism in NF membranes. This has been translated into predictive modeling based on the modified extended Nernst-Planck equation. Similarly various methods have been used to fabricate improved NF membranes especially through interfacial polyiberization incorporating nanoparticles and other additives, UV grafting/photografting, electron beam irradiation, plasma treatment and layer-by-layer modification. New applications were also explored in many industries. However fouling is still a prevalent issue that may hinder successful application of NF membranes.

Recent studies have found widespread pesticide contamination across the rivers that discharge into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Potential impacts on native fish species exposed to known endocrine disrupting chemicals such as atrazine, simazine, and diuron have not been assessed. In the present study, the authors examined the endocrine and physiological effects of short-term, acute exposure of environmentally relevant concentrations of analytical grade atrazine in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in a controlled laboratory experiment. Expression of hepatic vitellogenin was not affected, supporting results of previous studies that showed that atrazine does not have a direct estrogenic effect via mediation of estrogen receptors. The lack of effect on brain cytochrome P19B (CYP19B) expression levels, combined with increases in testosterone (T) and 17 beta estradiol and a stable T:17 beta estradiol ratio, does not support the hypothesis that atrazine has an indirect estrogenic effect via modulation of aromatase expression.

The need for a better understanding of the extent of undisclosed information in chemicals arose from collecting data on the hazards and exposures of chemicals used in typical mining operations (copper, platinum and coal). Four main categories of undisclosed chemicals were defined (incomplete disclosure; chemicals with unspecific identities; relative quantities of ingredients not stated; and trade secret ingredients) by reviewing material safety data sheet (MSDS) omissions in previous studies. A significant number of chemicals (20% of 957 different chemicals) across the three sites had a range of undisclosed information, with majority of the chemicals (39%) having unspecific identities. The majority of undisclosed information was found in commercially available motor oils followed by cleaning products and mechanical maintenance products, as opposed to reagents critical to the main mining processes. All three types of chemicals had trade secrets, unspecific chemical identities and incomplete disclosures. These types of undisclosed information pose a hindrance to a full understanding of the hazards, which is made worse when combined with additional MSDS omissions such as acute toxicity endpoints (LD50) and/or acute aquatic toxicity endpoints (LC50), as well as inadequate hazard classifications of ingredients. The communication of the hazard information in the MSDSs varied according to the chemical type, the manufacturer and the regulations governing the MSDSs. Undisclosed information can undermine occupational health protection, compromise the safety of workers in industry, hinder risk assessment procedures and cause uncertainty about future health. It comes down to the duty of care that industries have towards their employees. With a wide range of chemicals increasingly used, there is a balance that needs to be reached between disclosure requirements, trade secret provisions and definitions of hazardous ingredients for market needs, and the information required to protect the health of their workers.

This study constitutes a follow-up investigation of a 90-day feeding study conducted by Monsanto in order to obtain commercial release of this GMO, employing the same rat strain and analyzing biochemical parameters on the same number of animals per group as our investigation. Our research represents the first chronic study on these substances, in which all observations including tumors are reported chronologically. Thus, it was not designed as a carcinogenicity study. We report the major findings with 34 organs observed and 56 parameters analyzed at 11 time points for most organs. Results: Biochemical analyses confirmed very significant chronic kidney deficiencies, for all treatments and both sexes; 76% of the altered parameters were kidney-related. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5 to 5.5 times higher. Marked and severe nephropathies were also generally 1.3 to 2.3 times greater. In females, all treatment groups showed a two-to threefold increase in mortality, and deaths were earlier. This difference was also evident in three male groups fed with GM maize. All results were hormone-and sex-dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors more frequently and before controls; the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by consumption of GM maize and Roundup treatments. Males presented up to four times more large palpable tumors starting 600 days earlier than in the control group, in which only one tumor was noted. These results may be explained by not only the non-linear endocrinedisrupting effects of Roundup but also by the overexpression of the EPSPS transgene or other mutational effects in the GM maize and their metabolic consequences."

A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common 'inert' ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated."

Pesticides to be prioritized among all pesticides used in South Korea between 2007 and 2011 were selected by taking into account the volume of usage, toxicity, and epidemiological evidence. Annual agricultural use of pesticides has increased rapidly from the 1970s to 1990s in South Korea, but has declined since 2001. The quantity of pesticides used in 2011 was reported as 19,131 tons, and was comprised of 34.7% insecticides, 28.0% fungicides, and 27.1% herbicides. The 50 pesticides with the greatest volume of usage accounted for 82.6% of the total volume of pesticides used between 2007 and 2011, with the most-used active ingredient being machine oil, followed by mancozeb and then paraquat. Organophosphates were the most used among the top 50 pesticides. A total of 24 pesticides were selected for recommendation of intensive regulation in South Korea.

Our results showed that the fungicide formulation did not induce significant number of CAs in bovine cells after 24h treatment. Nevertheless, the dose-dependent reduction of mitotic division was observed, with the strongest effect at 30.0g mL(-1) in both donors (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Prolonged 48h exposure caused the increased level of breaks in treated cultures (3.0-15.0g mL(-1); P < 0.05) and significant decrease in mitotic index (MI). The tested fungicide failed to produce any statistical changes in the SCE frequency neither after 24h nor 48h treatment.

Activities were tested within the concentration range of 0.25-15 mu g/ml S-metolachlor for 24h of exposure. Both compounds rendered a minor reduction in the NDI although not reaching statistical significance. Results demonstrated that the S-metolachlor was not able to induce MNs. On the other hand, 0.5-6 mu g/ml Twin Pack Gold increased the frequency of MNs. When cytotoxicity was estimated, S-metolachlor was not able to induce either a reduction of lysosomal or mitochondrial activity. Contrarily, whereas 1-15 mu g/ml Twin Pack Gold induced a significant reduction of mitochondrial activity, all tested concentrations of the formulated product induced a significant decrease of lysosomal performance as a function of the concentration of the S-metolachlor-based formulation titrated into cultures. Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity differences obtained with pure S-metolachlor and the commercial S-metolachlor-based formulation indicate that the latter may contain additional unsafe xenobiotics and support the concept of the importance of evaluating not only the active principle but also the commercial formulation when estimating the real hazard from agrochemicals.

The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration.

Viper was the most toxic formulated herbicide. It was hypothesized that the toxicity of both formulated herbicides could have been enhanced by adjuvants, especially for Viper. In most cases, the sublethal endpoints were the most sensitive and affected by both formulations, comparatively to their acute effects. Concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models provided an accurate description of Mikado and Viper joint action on algae growth and immobilization of daphnids, although significant deviations were always detected. A low-dose antagonism and high-dose synergism were identified for P. subcapitata, whereas C. vulgaris response deviated antagonistically from CA and synergistically from IA. For both daphnids, however, synergistic effects were observed for higher mixture concentrations. Under a regulatory standpoint, CA provided the most conservative estimation either because the mixture effects were overestimated or less subestimated than IA. Overall, the great sensitivity differences observed within species did not allow the conclusion that one trophic level was more tolerant than the other. Instead, P. subcapitata was always the most sensitive species to both herbicide formulations, followed by D. longispina, while D. magna and C. vulgaris were the most tolerant species. On a whole, further studies are needed toward a comprehensive understanding of herbicides mode of action, their effects at lower biological-level endpoints, and under different mixture designs.

Twenty food samples were analysed with very low glyphosate concentrations (mean 0.08 mg/kg, range 0.002-0.5 mg/kg) with residues detected in more than 75% of the samples. Maternal dietary exposure was very low (0.001 mg/kg bw/day) and was considerably lower than the predicted National Estimated Daily Intake of glyphosate (0.02 mg/kg bw/day). The estimated exposure based on measured glyphosate in composite food samples corresponded to 0.4% of the acceptable daily intake for glyphosate, and the predicted concentration from dietary information was 4% which is comparable to the National Estimated Daily Intake of 5.5% of the Acceptable Daily Intake of glyphosate.

The efficiency of degradation by Fenton's reagent (Fe2+ =0.09 mM; H2O2 = 1.76 mM, 4 h) decreased with increasing initial MeS concentration, from 98% with 5 mg/L MeS, to 63% with 70 mg/L MeS.

Permeates of solutions with concentrations five times above the lethal doses (48 mg/l) did not present toxicity, pointing that all toxic compounds were removed at the same time. Glyphosate rejection over an 80% despite its molecular weight is lower than membrane MWCO, this could be associated to a predominant Donnan exclusion mechanism, combined with dielectric exclusion due to the solute high charge density. Glyphosate concentration did not show any effect over rejection. It increased when pressure was incremented from 2.5 to 4 bar and then remained constant in a 4-10 bar range. Because of dissociation of the glyphosate and the surface charged of the membrane depend on pH value, the rejection increase from 72.5 to 92.5% when pH increase from 4 to 8.5. Studies with river water showed the same behavior with a slight decrease in rejection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This paper formulates an answer based on two approaches. Starting from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) definition for green chemistry, production-based and environmental-impact-based definitions for green adjuvants are proposed. According to the production-based approach, adjuvants are defined as green if they are manufactured using renewable raw materials as much as possible while making efficient use of energy, preferably renewable energy. According to the environmental impact approach, adjuvants are defined as green (1) if they have a low human and environmental impact, (2) if they do not increase active ingredient environmental mobility and/or toxicity to humans and non-target organisms, (3) if they do not increase the exposure to these active substances and (4) if they lower the impact of formulated pesticides by enhancing the performance of active ingredients, thus potentially lowering the required dosage of active ingredients. Based on both approaches, a tentative definition for green adjuvants is given, and future research and legislation directions are set out. Copyright (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry"

The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior.Methodology/Principal Findings: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 mu g organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment.Conclusions/Significance: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health."

Associations between ever having an HPEE and neurobehavioral outcomes were estimated with linear regression controlling for age and outcome-specific covariates.A history of ever having an HPEE was reported by 156 (23%) participants. Adverse associations were observed between ever having an HPEE and two of the nine neurobehavioral tests. On a test of visual scanning and processing (Digit-Symbol), participants who ever had an HPEE were 4.2 s slower (95% CI: -7.27, -1.11) than those without an HPEE, equivalent to the effect of 3.9 years of age in this population.

We investigated the aquatic toxicity of five commercial wood preservative products, the biocidal active substances and some formulation additives contained therein, as well as six generic binary mixtures of the active substances in the fish embryo toxicity test (FET). Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the single substances, the mixtures, and the products were estimated from concentrationresponse curves and corrected for concentrations measured in the test medium. The comparison of the experimentally observed mixture toxicity with the toxicity predicted by the concept of concentration addition (CA) showed less than twofold deviation for all binary mixtures of the active substances and for three of the biocidal products. A more than 60-fold underestimation of the toxicity of the fourth product by the CA prediction was detected and could be explained fully by the toxicity of one formulation additive, which had been labeled as a hazardous substance. The reason for the 4.6-fold underestimation of toxicity of the fifth product could not be explained unambiguously. Overall, the FET was found to be a suitable screening tool to verify whether the toxicity of formulated wood preservatives can reliably be predicted by CA.

Pendimethalin concentrations in the exposure water and muscles were followed. White blood cell counts, differential leucocyte counts, cell mortality and phagocytosis activity were measured. Haemolytic alternative complement activity, lysozyme concentration and stress parameters were analyzed.The resulting concentration of pendimethalin in the exposure water was lower than the expected concentration. At D28, the concentration quantified in the contaminated fish was negligible in comparison with the Reference Dose for Oral Exposure estimated by US-EPA's Integrated Risk Information System.

According to German regulations, herbicides can be applied in mixtures with variable intensities. The ecological impact of the resulting strategies is still poorly understood. However, it was hypothesized that the influence of herbicide strategies on earthworm abundance. biomass, and diversity is minor compared to environment and tillage intensity in sugar beet. Therefore, additional specific factor variation seemed to be a prerequisite for getting valuable results. The herbicide strategies were applied in a ploughing system and a mulching system in 19 environments (site x year) in Germany in 2008 and 2009. Earthworm expulsions were carried out in spring and autumn with 2204 samples in total.The earthworm population was determined by environment and tillage system rather than by herbicide strategies. The environments displayed the largest variability in earthworm abundance, ranging from 12 to 195 individuals m(-2), and a considerable variation in the occurrence of earthworm species. In spring, the deleterious impact of ploughing, with 80% lower mean earthworm abundance compared to the mulching system, was observed across all environments. During vegetation, the stronger increase in earthworm population in the ploughing system did not compensate for the initial differences. Regardless of intensity, the herbicide strategies were not accompanied by corresponding detrimental effects on earthworms between each other. In conclusion, the earthworm population was subjected to a multiplicity of influencing factors and the results markedly demonstrated for the first time the negligible effect of herbicide application intensity in sugar beet.

As a result, LC50 values of glyphosate, DA, and the glyphosate herbicide were > 160 mg/l, 8.5 mg/l, and 76.8 mg/l, respectively. On the other hand, adult male medaka fish were exposed to each of the glyphosate agrochemical components for 48 hr at the following concentrations: 16 mg/l of glyphosate, 0.5 mg/l of DA, and 16 mg/l-glyphosate/0.5 mg/l-DA mixture. Interestingly, DNA microarray analysis revealed that there were no significant gene expression changes in the medaka liver after exposure to glyphosate. Nevertheless, 78 and 138 genes were significantly induced by DA and the glyphosate/DA mixture, respectively. Furthermore, we identified five common genes that were affected by DA and glyphosate/DA mixture. These results suggested that glyphosate itself possessed very low toxicity as previously reported by some researchers at least to the small laboratory fish, and the major toxicity of the glyphosate agrochemical resided mainly in DA and perhaps in unintentionally generated byproduct(s) of glyphosate-DA mixture."

The upcoming new EU regulation concerning the introduction of plant protection products on the market (EC1107/2009) includes for the first time the demand for information on the possible negative effects of not only the active ingredients but also the used adjuvants. This new regulation requires basic toxicological information that allows decisions on the use/ban or preference of use of available adjuvants. In this study we obtained toxicological relevant information through a multiple endpoint reporter assay for a broad selection of commonly used adjuvants including several solvents (e. g. isophorone) and non-ionic surfactants (e. g. ethoxylated alcohols). The used assay allows the toxicity screening in a mechanistic way, with direct measurement of specific toxicological responses (e. g. oxidative stress, DNA damage, membrane damage and general cell lesions). The results show that the selected solvents are less toxic than the surfactants, suggesting that solvents may have a preference of use, but further research on more compounds is needed to confirm this observation. The gene expression profiles of the selected surfactants reveal that a phenol (ethoxylated tristyrylphenol) and an organosilicone surfactant (ethoxylated trisiloxane) show little or no inductions at EC(20) concentrations, making them preferred surfactants for use in different applications. The organosilicone surfactant shows little or no toxicity and good adjuvant properties. However, this study also illustrates possible genotoxicity (induction of the bacterial SOS response) for several surfactants (POEA, AE, tri-EO, EO FA and EO NP) and one solvent (gamma-butyrolactone).

These substances are potentially toxic pollutants because they induce the production of reactive oxygen species for biological systems and exert oxidative stress in nontarget organisms living in the treated aquatic systems. Recent evidence suggests differences in the toxicity of glyphosate in the form of an active ingredient compared to the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with surfactants, such as those found in commercial formulations. In Mexico, one of the most widely used glyphosate-based herbicides is Yerbimat, which has agricultural as well as aquatic weed control applications. However, there are no aquatic toxicity data, particularly regarding native fish. Therefore, we determined the acute toxicity of commercial-formulation Yerbimat in a static bioassay at 96 h (LC50). We also determined its toxicity at 96 h in sublethal concentrations to assess the lipid peroxidation levels (LPX), catalase activity, hepatic glycogen content, and histological damage in the liver and gills of the fish Goodea atripinnis associated with chronic exposure (75 days). The LC50 was 38.95 +/- 0.33 mg/L. The results of the short-term exposure study indicate that Yerbimat can potentially induce oxidative stress in G. atripinnis, because LPX was increased in the gills and liver. Catalase activity was reduced in the gills but increased in the liver, whereas hepatic glycogen was depleted. Chronic exposure was associated with histopathological damage in the gills and liver, some of which was irreversible. Yerbimat represents a potential risk for aquatic biota; therefore, we recommend that its application be carefully considered."

Glyphosate forms complexes with metal ions (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn) in the soil, but precipitation washes it into deeper soil layers. Its primary metabolite, AMPA, is more mobile than the parent compound. Their detection in environmental samples is rather problematic, this is why these compounds are not listed in most countries among commonly detected pesticide residues. The expansion of glyphosate-tolerant GM crops is likely to result in more common occurrence of glyphosate in food and feed, and metabolites AMPA and NAG may also call for special attention depending on given genetic events. Severe professional debates are going on regarding the side-effects of glyphosate and its herbicide preparations (particularly those containing POEA as formulating agent). Glyphosate reduces disease tolerance of certain plants, while facilitating fungal root colonization e.g., Fusarium species. It is toxic to amphibians, and is suspected to exert teratogenicity on birds and amphibians. Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of glyphosate-based preparations are at a cross-fire of debates. The hormone modulant effect of glyphosate is exacerbated by the formulating agent (POEA).

Thus, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of atrazine and an atrazine-based herbicide (Gesaprim (R)) on a model fish species Carassius auratus L, 1758, (Pisces: Cyprinidae) using the micronucleus test and the comet assay in peripheral blood erythrocytes. Fish were exposed to 5, 10 and 15 mu g/L atrazine and to its commercial formulation for 2,4 and 6 days. Ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) at a single dose of 5 mg/L was used as positive control. Our results revealed significant increases in the frequencies of micronuclei and DNA strand breaks in erythrocytes of C. auratus, following exposure to commercial formulation of atrazine and thus demonstrated the genotoxic potential of this pesticide on fish.

However, there is a paucity of data on human dermal exposure to insecticides applied by this method. The objective of the current study was to estimate dermal exposures to the insecticide active ingredient permethrin using water- (Aqua-Reslin (R)) and oil-based (Permanone (R) 30-30) formulations with passive dosimetry. No significant differences in deposition of permethrin were observed between years, distance from the spray source, front or back of the body, or the placement of the patches on the body. However, exposure to Aqua-Reslin was significantly greater than Permanone 30-30 and average concentrations deposited on the body were 4.2 and 2.1 ng/cm(2), respectively. The greater deposition of Aqua-Reslin is most likely due to the higher density of the water-based formulation which causes it to settle out faster than the lighter oil-based formulation of Permanone 30-30. The estimated average absorbed dermal exposure for permethrin from Aqua-Reslin and Permanone 30-30 was 0.00009 and 0.00005 mg/kg body weight, respectively. We also found that ground deposition of ULV insecticides can be used as a surrogate for estimating dermal exposure. The estimated exposures support the findings of previous risk assessments that exposure to ULV applications used for mosquito management are below regulatory levels of concern."

Cumulative (14)CO(2) release was estimated to be approximately 6% or less of the amount of [(14)C]glyphosate originally added in both soils over an 80-d incubation. For all but the highest Cu treatments (400 mg kg(-1)) in the coarse-textured Arkport soil, Mineralization began without a lag phase and declined over time. No inhibition of mineralization was observed for Zn up to 400 mg kg(-1) in either soil, suggesting differential sensitivity of glyphosate mineralization to the types of metal and soil. Interestingly, Zn appeared to alleviate high-Cu inhibition of mineralization in the Arkport soil. The protective role of Zn against Cu toxicity was also observed in the pure culture study with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that increased mineralization rates in high Cu soil with Zn additions might have been due to alleviation of cellular toxicity by Zn rather than a mineralization specific mechanism. Extensive use of glyphosate combined with its reduced degradation in Cu-contaminated, coarse-textured soils may increase glyphosate persistence in soil and consequently facilitate Cu and glyphosate mobilization in the soil environment.

The extent and magnitude of the risks arising from the consequent environmental contamination are largely unknown. Therefore, we selected two representative nurseries for which we conducted tiered health risk assessments (HRA) using risk-based benchmarks and two calculation tools (SSL and Risc-Human software). Ecological risk assessments (ERA) involved comparisons of environmental concentrations with ecotoxicological benchmarks. Site investigations revealed that the concentration of several pesticides exceeded the Finnish soil quality guidelines in some places. The compost pile for organic residues and the pond receiving runoffs contained traces of pesticides and the maximum concentration of atrazine and terbuthylazine in groundwater exceeded the corresponding guideline for household water. Hexachlorobenzene proved to pose the highest health risks, the maximum hazard quotient being around 10 (carcinogenity-based) in the residential land use scenario. Owing to the conservative assumptions, health risks are expected to remain insignificant, however. Risks to the local terrestrial ecosystem would also remain low, while only further studies will reveal the actual risks to the adjoining aquatic ecosystem. Both calculation tools showed shortcomings that generate uncertainty in the HRA, whereas the ERA was hampered particularly by the lack of benchmarks."

The present study extents these findings to commercially sold and frequently applied pesticide mixtures by investigating whether the aquatic toxicity of 66 herbicidal and 53 fungicidal combination products, i.e., authorized plant protection products that contain two or more active substances, can reliably be predicted by CA.Results: In more than 50% of cases, the predicted and observed mixture toxicity deviated by less than factor 2. An indication for a synergistic interaction was only detected with regard to algal growth inhibition for mixtures of fungicides that inhibit different enzymes of ergosterol biosynthesis. The greatest degree of compliance between prediction and observation was found for the acute toxicity of fungicidal products towards Daphnia and fish, while the greatest degree of underestimation of product toxicity occurred for the acute toxicity of herbicidal products towards Daphnia and fish. Using the lowest available toxicity measures within taxonomic groups as the most conservative approach resulted in a bias towards overestimation of product toxicity, but did not eliminate cases of considerable underestimation of product toxicity.Conclusions: The results suggest that the CA concept can be applied to predict the aquatic toxicity of commercial pesticide mixtures using the heterogeneous data typically available in a risk assessment context for a number of clearly identified combinations of test species and pesticide types with reasonably small uncertainty."

Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24 h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7 d growth was observed at 10% of the 24 h LC10 (53 mu g L-1) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24 h LC10 (0.14 mu g L-1) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24 h LC10 of Talstare (0.03 mu g L-1). Fipronil and Termidor led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142 mu g L-1 and 148 mu g L-1 respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides.

They are applied to agricultural, landscape and structural pest management by governmental agencies, private institutions and individuals. PRIs typically assess only the potential risks associated with the active ingredients because, with few exceptions, pesticide manufacturers disclose only the identity of the active ingredients which generally comprise only a minor portion of pesticide products. We show that when inert ingredients are identified and assessed by the same process as the active ingredient, the product specific risk can be much greater than that calculated for the active ingredient alone.

Among the non-target terrestrial organisms exposed to such scenarios, earthworms are key ecological receptors widely used in ecotoxicological studies. As such, this work aims to assess the effects of two herbicide active ingredients (a.i.)-sulcotrione and penoxsulam-and their respective commercial formulations-MIKADOA (R) and VIPERA (R) (referred as Mikado and Viper)-on the avoidance behaviour of Eisenia andrei. In an attempt to enhance the ecological relevance of the generated toxicity data, the avoidance tests were run with standard (LUFA 2.2; L) and natural soils (from corn and rice fields), as long as their habitat function did not constrain the earthworm behaviour.Earthworms were bred in the lab before test conductance. The natural soils used as substrates were collected before the cropping season on corn (C) and rice (R) fields, which are integrated in a wide area exploited for agriculture. Their physico-chemical characterization evolved the determination of pH (H2O, KCl), conductivity, organic matter (OM) and clay/silt contents, and water-holding capacity (WHC). The avoidance tests intended to ascertain (1) the random distribution of earthworms in the natural soils C and R (dual-control tests), (2) the habitat function of natural soils against each other and against L soil, (3) the effect of active ingredients and formulated herbicides on E. andrei behaviour. Avoidance tests with the a.i.s were only performed in L soil. Data evaluation followed ISO (2005) guidelines.C and R soils presented higher OM (5.1% and 4.5%, respectively) and clay/silt (53.3 and 43.1, respectively) contents and WHC (107.2 and 109.9%, respectively) than L soil (4.1, 21.4 and 48.0%, correspondingly). Earthworms distributed randomly in dual-control tests, but preferred R soil significantly, relative to L or C soils. The LOEC and EC50 values calculated for sulcotrione (> 1,000.0 and 1,263.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) and Mikado (1,012.8 and 1,301.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) were much higher than those calculated for penoxsulam (100 and 80.6 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) or Viper (52.7 and 51.5 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively), when L soil was used as substrate. Moreover, the habitat function of L soil contaminated with the formulated herbicide Viper was more constrained relative to that of the a.i. penoxsulam. Viper induced higher % avoidance on E. andrei exposed to the contaminated L soil compared to that under the R soil.The response of earthworms to R (attraction) and C (avoidance) soils could be related, not only to the quantity of OM content, but also to the quality of organic and inorganic fractions of soil, beyond other intrinsic properties of soils. Both Mikado and sulcotrione impacted the behaviour of E. andrei only slightly. This endpoint was more affected under penoxsulam or Viper exposures on L soil, being the latter-formulated product even more repellent for E. andrei than the a.i. The effect of adjuvants added to the commercial formulation of Viper, may have increased the toxicity of the a.i. Thereby, our results reinforce the need for a careful assessment of the impacts of formulated products. Furthermore, since there was a reduction in earthworm % avoidance under Viper exposures on the natural soil R, it was possible that pesticide bioavailability had been reduced by its sorption to OM and clay mineral sorption sites.Though the standard L soil should be used for reproducibility and comparison means, other natural soils should be added to the assessment of chemicals, for sake of ecological relevance. Both herbicides induced avoidance behaviour on E. andrei, albeit stronger effects were denoted by penoxsulam and its respective formulated product, Viper. Overall, avoidance tests provided a sensitive, valuable and feasible response either to compare the habitat function of different standard and agricultural natural soils or to test the effect of herbicides.An effort should be made to enlarge the terrestrial ecotoxicological database as a way to fulfil the huge lack of information available for this ecosystem. In this context, additional research congregating a potential linkage between physiological activities sustaining the regular metabolism of earthworms and their avoidance behaviour or even their reproductive effects would be welcomed, especially in what regards formulated pesticides. Such approach would provide a robust and comprehensive understanding of chemical effects. Furthermore, it is encouraged that natural soils should be used to improve the reliability of chemical testing."

This dilution level is far below agricultural recommendations and corresponds to low levels of residues in food or feed. The formulations have been compared to G alone and with its main metabolite AMPA or with one known adjuvant of R formulations, POEA. HUVEC primary neonate umbilical cord vein cells have been tested with 293 embryonic kidney and JEG3 placental cell lines. All R formulations cause total cell death within 24 h, through an inhibition of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, and necrosis, by release of cytosolic adenylate kinase measuring membrane damage. They also induce apoptosis via activation of enzymatic caspases 3/7 activity. This is confirmed by characteristic DNA fragmentation, nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), which is demonstrated by DAPI in apoptotic round cells. G provokes only apoptosis, and HUVEC are 100 times more sensitive overall at this level. The deleterious effects are not proportional to G concentrations but rather depend on the nature of the adjuvants. AMPA and POEA separately and synergistically damage cell membranes like R but at different concentrations. Their mixtures are generally even more harmful with G. In conclusion, the R adjuvants like POEA change human cell permeability and amplify toxicity induced already by G, through apoptosis and necrosis. The real threshold of G toxicity must take into account the presence of adjuvants but also G metabolism and time-amplified effects or bioaccumulation. This should be discussed when analyzing the in vivo toxic actions of R. This work clearly confirms that the adjuvants in Roundup formulations are not inert. Moreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death around residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R formulation-treated crops."

Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals' toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher Iona-term. 17 C, than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments. These results suggest that long-term exposures can provide relevant complementary information on mixtures' toxicity that should be taken into account within pesticide risk assessment procedures."

Nevertheless, little is known about the toxic effects of formulated herbicides, since many studies have been carried out using pure active molecules alone. In this work, we used as an eukaryotic model system an autochthonous wine yeast strain to investigate the effects of three commercial herbicides, currently used in the same geographical area from where this strain had been isolated. We carried out a comparative proteomic analysis to study the effects at the protein level of the herbicide-related stress, and found that the herbicides tested can alter the yeast proteome producing responses that share homologies with those observed treating yeast cells with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or with well-known oxidizing agents. We evaluated, through redox-proteomic techniques, protein carbonylation as a biomarker of oxidative stress. This analysis showed that herbicide-induced carbonylation is a dynamic phenomenon with degrees of selectivity."

Fish were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 mu g/L doses of trifluralin and Treflan for 3, 6, and 9 days under laboratory conditions. Ethylmethanesulfonate, at a single dose of 10 mg/L, was used as positive control. Micronuclei were evaluated on the peripheral erythrocytes. Both Treflan and trifluralin treatments significantly increased the micronucleus frequencies in peripheral erythrocytes of O. niloticus. Furthermore, the genotoxicity of the active ingredient, trifluralin, was observed to be higher than that of the commercial formulation Treflan. Our results indicate that herbicide trifluralin has genotoxic potential in fish."

To clarify the effects of three herbicides as commercial formulations (namely, Pointer, Silglif, and Proper Energy), parameters related to oxidative issues were investigated on an autochthonous wine yeast strain. It was demonstrated that herbicides were able to affect the enzymatic activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, as well as to induce carbonylation and thiol oxidation as post-translational modifications of proteins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an optimal model system to study responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress. Thus, the results obtained could further the understanding of mechanisms underlying the toxicity of herbicides."

The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased in the liver and decreased in muscle, while oxidative damage to lipids increased above control values in both tissues, showing that the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress are involved in the toxicity induced by Roundup (R). Additionally, tadpoles' hyperactivity was associated with tachycardia in vivo, probably due to a stress-induced adrenergic stimulation. Ventricle strips of Roundup (R)-exposed tadpoles (R-group) presented a faster relaxation and also a higher cardiac pumping capacity at the in vivo contraction frequency, indicating that bullfrog tadpoles were able to perform cardiac mechanistic adjustments to face Roundup (R)-exposure. However, the lower maximal in vitro contraction frequency of the R-group could limit its in vivo cardiac performance, when the adrenergic-stimulation is present. The association between the high energetic cost to counteract the harmful effects of this herbicide and the induction of oxidative stress suggest that low and realistic concentrations of Roundup (R) can have an impact on tadpoles' performance and success, jeopardizing their survival and/or population establishment."

The aim of this review is to present and discuss the state of knowledge on sorption, degradation and leachability of glyphosate in soils. Difficulties of drawing clear and unambiguous conclusions because of strong soil dependency and limited conclusive investigations are pointed out. Nevertheless, the risk of ground and surface water pollution by glyphosate seems limited because of sorption onto variable-charge soil minerals, e.g. aluminium and iron oxides, and because of microbial degradation. Although sorption and degradation are affected by many factors that might be expected to affect glyphosate mobility in soils, glyphosate leaching seems mainly determined by soil structure and rainfall. Limited leaching has been observed in non-structured sandy soils, while subsurface leaching to drainage systems was observed in a structured soil with preferential flow in macropores, but only when high rainfall followed glyphosate application. Glyphosate in drainage water runs into surface waters but not necessarily to groundwater because it may be sorbed and degraded in deeper soil layers before reaching the groundwater. Although the transport of glyphosate from land to water environments seems very limited, knowledge about subsurface leaching and surface runoff of glyphosate as well as the importance of this transport as related to ground and surface water quality is scarce.
