When applied, it is not used as a pure active ingredient but in the form of commercial formulations. Besides atrazine, these formulations contain other substances that might represent a risk to human health due to their mutual interactions. We evaluated the genotoxicity, apoptosis and necrosis induction of atrazine as an active ingredient, the commercial formulation Gesaprim (R), and a Gesaprim (R) adjuvant mixture without atrazine by comet and DNA diffusion assay, respectively. Human lymphocytes were treated for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 It with 0.047 mu g/ml, 0.47 mu g/ml, 4.7 mu g/ml of substances tested both in the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activator. Atrazine did not appear to be genotoxic or to be capable of inducing apoptosis or necrosis. Unlike atrazine, Gesaprime (R) and the adjuvant mixture increased DNA damage in lymphocytes. After 5 h of treatment, it also increased the number of apoptotic cells. Metabolic activation additionally enhanced the DNA-damaging potential of Gesaprim (R) and the adjuvant mixture but did not affect atrazine genotoxicity. Thus, both assay endpoints differed significantly for the active ingredient and formulation. To evaluate the potential health risk of simultaneous exposure to adjuvants and an active ingredient, further efforts using a biomonitoring approach should be made. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

coxref2,Guy,YES,"Garcia-Ortega, S; Holliman, PJ; Jones, DL",Toxicology and fate of Pestanal (R) and commercial propetamphos formulations in river and estuarine sediment,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"To quantify the impact of organophosphate pesticides on aquatic ecosystems requires a mechanistic understanding of their behaviour in a range of environmental matrices. The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption, biodegradation and toxic effects of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid, followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (K-d = 7-11) than for the Pestanal (R) grade (K-d = 4-10). The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t(1/2)=15 d) compared to anaerobic conditions (t(1/2) = 19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the Pestanal (R) grade of propetamphos based on EC50 (21 versus 236 mu g g(-1)) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 mu g g(-1)). In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of using commercial pesticide formulations when carrying out ecotoxicological testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

As a new pesticide within a relatively new class of pesticides, bifenthrin is considered relatively safe. Here, we used the PC12 neuronal cell line to examine the effect of bifenthrin on the formation of neurites and the potential developmental neurotoxicity of this pesticide. Material/Methods: PC12 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of technical grade bifenthrin or Ortho Home Defense (R). Cell viability was determined using the AlmarBlue Toxicity Assay Nontoxic concentrations of these chemicals were concomitantly with nerve growth factor and neurite Outgrowth was assessed. Results: Ortho Home Defense (R) preparation reduced PC12 cell viability by approximately 50% and 70% at dilutions that correlate to bifenthrin concentrations of 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M, respectively. In contrast, technical grade bifenthrin, was not toxic to PC12 cells at 10(-3) M, which was the highest concentration tested that was soluble. At nontoxic concentrations of 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M, the Ortho Home Defense (R) inhibited nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth by 30% and 55% respectively. Furthermore the nontoxic concentrations of technical grade bifenthrin of 10(-6) M and 10(-3) M inhibited neurite outgrowth by approximately 35% and 75% respectively. Conclusions: These data suggest that the toxicity of the Ortho Home Defense (R) preparation was due to the inert additives in the preparation and not the bifenthrin itself. Further, these data suggest that, even in the absence of overt toxicity, bifenthrin may have deleterious effects to developing nervous system.",2006,12,BR57,BR62,
coxref4,Guy,YES,"Peixoto, F",Comparative effects of the Roundup and glyphosate on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,CHEMOSPHERE,"The potential toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its fundamental substance (glyphosate) was tested in bioenergetic functions of isolated rat liver mitocbondria. Roundup stimulates succinate-supported respiration twice, with simultaneous collapse of transmembrane electrical potential, while glyphosate used in the same concentrations does not induce any significant effect. Additionally, Roundup depresses state 3 respiration by about 40%, at 15 mM, whereas uncoupled respiration in the presence of FCCP is depressed by about 50%. Depression of uncoupled respiratory activity is mediated through partial inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II and III, but not of complex IV. The phosphorylative system was affected by both a direct and an indirect effect on the F0F1 ATPase activity. The addition of uncoupled concentrations of Roundup to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria treated with Ruthenium Red resulted in non-specific membrane permeabilization, as evidenced by mitochondrial swelling in isosmotic sucrose medium. Therefore, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also related to the non-specific membrane permeabilization induced by Roundup. Glyphosate alone does not show any relevant effect on the mitochondrial bioenergetics, in opposition to Roundup formulation products. The differences in the toxicity observed could be either attributed to some products of Roundup or to a synergic effect of glyphosate and formulation products. Bearing in mind that mitochondria is provided with a variety of bioenergetic functions mandatory for the regulation of intracellular aerobic energy production and electrolyte homeostasis, these results question the safety of Roundup on animal health.

Its residues may thus enter the food chain, and glyphosate is found as a contaminant in rivers. Some agricultural workers using glyphosate have pregnancy problems, but its mechanism of action in mammals is questioned. Here we show that glyphosate is toxic to human placental JEG3 cells within 18 hr with concentrations lower than those found with agricultural use, and this effect increases with concentration and time or in the presence of Roundup adjuvants. Surprisingly, Roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredient. We tested the effects of glyphosate and Roundup at lower nontoxic concentrations on aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis. The glyphosate-based herbicide disrupts aromatase activity and mRNA levels and interacts with the active site of the purified enzyme, but the effects of glyphosate are facilitated by the Roundup formulation in microsomes or in cell culture. We conclude that endocrine and toxic effects of Roundup, not just glyphosate, can be observed in mammals. We suggest that the presence of Roundup adjuvants enhances glyphosate bioavailability and/or bioaccumulation.",2005,113,716,720,10.1289/ehp.7728

We compared the acute toxicity of the glyphosate end-use formulation Roundup Original(R) to four North American amphibian species (Rana clamitans, R. pipiens, R. sylvatica, and Bufo americanus) and the toxicity of glyphosate technical, the polyethoxylated tallowamine surfactant (POEA) commonly used in glyphosate-based herbicides, and five newer glyphosate formulations to R. clamitans. For R. clamitans, acute toxicity values in order of decreasing toxicity were POEA > Roundup Original > Roundup Transor(R) > Glyfos AU(R); no significant acute toxicity was observed with glyphosate technical material or the glyphosate formulations Roundup Biactive(R), Touchdown(R), or Glyfos BIO(R). Comparisons between the four amphibian species showed that the toxicity of Roundup Original varied with species and developmental stage. Rana pipiens tadpoles chronically exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of POEA or glyphosate formulations containing POEA showed decreased snout-vent length at metamorphosis and increased time to metamorphosis, tail damage, and gonadal abnormalities. These effects may be caused, in some part, by disruption of hormone signaling, because thyroid hormone receptor P mRNA transcript levels were elevated by exposure to formulations containing glyphosate and POEA. Taken together, the data suggest that surfactant composition must be considered in the evaluation of toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides.",2004,23,1928,1938,10.1897/03-71

Plants of Sinapis arvensis or S. alba were sprayed with seven doses of the herbicides alone and binary fixed-ratio mixtures of the four herbicides. In total, 73 binary mixtures were studied in six separate experiments. Mixtures of glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium were less phytotoxic than predicted by ADM whether commercial formulations or technical grade products were applied. In contrast, mixtures of glyphosate and metsulfuron-methyl, glyphosate and imazapyr, glufosinate-ammonium and metsulfuron-methyl, glufosinate-ammonium and imazapyr, and metsulfuron-methyl and imazapyr either followed ADM or were synergistic. Synergism was observed most frequently for mixtures of glyphosate or glufosinate-ammonium with metsulfuron-methyl. Synergism was also more pronounced for commercial formulations of glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium than for the corresponding technical grade formulations, implying that synergism was caused by the presence of the formulation constituents of the commercial glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium formulations in the spray solution.",2004,44,313,322,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2004.00405.x

It has been hypothesized that 4-NP in a pesticide formulation is linked to historical declines in Canadian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations, with effects being related to exposure during parr-smolt transformation (PST). To test this hypothesis, Atlantic salmon smolts were exposed to pulse-doses of water-borne 4-NP (20 ug/l), sustained doses of water-borne E-2(100 ng/l) (positive control), or ethanol vehicle (negative control) in mid-May during the final stages of PST. Individually tagged smolts were then sampled at three times (June, July and October) to monitor subsequent growth in sea water and plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations. Smolt weights and plasma IGF-I concentrations were both affected by E-2 and 4-NP. The effects of E-2 and 4-NP on mean smolt weights were most prominent in July and October {E-2 (*98.1 +/- 2.8, *242.3 +/- 10.6 g), 4-NP (*102.1 +/- 3.1, 255.7 +/- 9.5 g), controls (112.5 +/- 2.8, 282.3 +/- 8.8 g)} (P < 0.05), while their effects on mean plasma IGF-I concentrations were most prominent in June and October {E-2( 15.0 +/- 1.9, 28.4 +/- 1.8 ng/ml), 4-NP (*14.8 +/- 1.9, *21.6 +/- 1.7 ng/ml), controls (20.0 +/- 1.1, 31.1 +/- 2.0 ng/ml)} (P < 0.05). Additionally, results suggest that the mechanisms of action of E-2 and 4-NP involve disruption in the GH/IGF-I axis, and that they may be different from each other. The effects of E2 and 4-NP on growth and plasma IGF-I concentrations observed in this study are ecologically significant because they evoke concerns for successful growth and survival of wild salmon smolts exposed to low levels of estrogenic substances that may occur from current discharges into rivers supporting sea-run salmon stocks.

Most human exposures involving toxic chemicals or mixtures are thought to originate from environmental and occupational sources; however, concurrent exposures are also likely from other sources, such as prescription and nonprescription drugs, indoor air pollutants, alcohol, and tobacco smoke. Thus, in evaluating the potential hazard following exposure to environmental mixtures, ATSDR not only considers the inherent joint toxicity of the mixture but also the influence of environmental, demographic, occupational, and lifestyle factors. To foster these goals, ATSDR has pursued a Mixtures Research and Assessment Program that consists of three component efforts: trend analysis, joint toxicity assessment, and experimental testing. Through trend analysis, ATSDR sets priorities for environmental mixtures of concern for which joint toxicity assessments are conducted as needed. If data are not available to conduct appropriate assessments, a research agenda is pursued through established extramural mechanisms. Ultimately, the data generated are used to support ATSDR's work at sites involving exposure to chemical mixtures. This pragmatic approach allows testable hypotheses or research needs to be identified and resolved and enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of joint toxicity. Several collaborative and cooperative efforts with national and international organizations such as the Toxicology and Nutrition Office, the Netherlands, and the Department of Energy are being pursued as part of these activities. ATSDR also develops guidance manuals to consistently and accurately apply current methodologies for the joint toxicity assessment of chemicals. Further, expert panels often are assembled to resolve outstanding scientific issues or obtain expert advice on pertinent issues. Recently, the need for studies on chemical mixtures has been proposed as one of the six priority areas the agency identified in its agenda for public health environmental research. This has been reinforced through the agency's close work with communities whose leaders have spoken passionately about their concern for information on exposures to chemical mixtures. The five other priority research areas the agency identified are exposure, susceptible populations, communities and tribal involvement, evaluation/surveillance of health effects, and health promotion/prevention.",2004,7,339,350,10.1080/10937400490498075
coxref10,Guy,NO,"Eggen, RIL; Segner, H",The potential of mechanism-based bioanalytical tools in ecotoxicological exposure and effect assessment,ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,"The current challenge to ecotoxicology is to develop tools that allow rapid and cost-efficient detection of those environmental chemicals or their combinations that are responsible for sublethal, chronic toxic effects in exposed organisms. Bioanalytical tools may meet these challenges, particularly if they are mechanism-based. Technically, bioanalytical tools allow rapid and cost-efficient analysis of environmental matrices. Mechanism-based, bioanalytical tools, however, do not only indicate that certain chemicals are there, but-and this is the major advantage of mechanism-based bioanalytical tools (MBBTs)-they indicate that chemicals with a specific mode of toxic action or a specific toxic potential are there. In this way MBBTs bridge exposure and effect assessment and help in a faster identification of the causative agent(s). Several principles of MBBTs, including immunoassays, enzyme inhibition assays, receptor assays and gene induction assays are briefly discussed and their application in processes such as bioassay-directed fractionation is illustrated. The focus of this manuscript is the analytical power of MBBTs in exposure and effect assessment. MBBTs have, however, a much broader potential and can support research on other challenges in ecotoxicology such as mixture effects or multiple effects caused by single pollutants or by various stresses simultaneously.",2003,377,386,396,10.1007/s00216-003-2059-y

In the present study, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction and cell cycle kinetics alterations by 2,4-D in 4-day old chick embryos were evaluated. Both a commercial herbicide formulation containing 37% 2,4-D isooctyl ester as active ingredient and pure 2,4-D were tested. Chick embryos were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg 2,4-D. Test solutions were applied to the inner shell membrane on day 0 of incubation. Either commercial formulation or pure 2,4-D induced a dose-related increase in SCE frequency over the concentration range from 0 to 4 mg/embryo. Significantly higher SCE frequency was seen for the 4-mg group of embryos treated with the commercial product. A slightly higher SCE value was observed for the vehicle group (acetone-treated embryos) compared with the negative controls (untreated embryos). Significant inhibition of cell cycle progression was evident in both experimental groups and was generally dose related. The extent of changes in cell kinetics was similar in both groups, although somewhat more marked in the group treated with pure 2,4-D. The present findings corroborate the positive results from recent in vivo rodent studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",2003,55,338,343,10.1016/S0147-6513(02)00131-8

Test compounds included the fungicide, vinclozolin and the clinical antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate. Newly hatched medaka were exposed to aqueous solutions of vinclozolin (2500 mug/l) and the vinclozolin fungicide formulation, Ronilan(R) (1000 and 5000 mug/l) and cyproterone acetate (1 and 10 mug/l), for 3 months. Histological evaluation of the gonadal tissues of exposed fish indicated that the 5000 mug/l concentration of the vinclozolin formulation (Ronilan(R)) induced a low incidence of intersex. (i.e. testis-ova) and the 2500 mug/l concentration of vinclozolin-affected spermatogenesis in males. Also, the vinclozolin treatments induced moderate ovarian atresia. Cyproterone acetate also induced a low incidence of testis-ova, but in contrast to the vinclozolin treatment the amount of ovarian tissue in the testis-ova was equal to or greater than the amount of testicular tissue. In the cyproterone acetate treatments, both oogenesis and spermatogenesis were moderately inhibited at all test concentrations. The results of this study indicate that antiandrogens have the potential to alter testicular development and gametogenesis in fish. However, research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which antiandrogens affect fish. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",2003,63,391,403,10.1016/S0166-445X(02)00189-3

One group of activities comprises the development of a new computer program for analyzing mixture studies and a mathematical model as a basis for combination rules that predict the toxicity of mixtures. Other new activities in the area of experimental studies are the application of gene expression technologies in mixture research, and pattern recognition as a tool in safety evaluation of complex mixtures. A bottom-up approach for chemosensory detection of mixtures has recently been presented. Other topics include a method for the safety evaluation of natural flavoring complexes, and an evaluation of the possible health effects of the simultaneous intake of food additives. Examples of issues related to mixtures of airborne chemicals are potential interaction of fine particles and gaseous pollutants in ambient air, nasal cancer associated with inhaled chemical mixtures, and the recommendation of a limit value for volatile organic compounds. Topics of a more strategic nature include studies concerning the public health effects of large airports, and the development of criteria for a harmonized classification of chemical mixtures. This overview illustrates that strategies to tackle the safety evaluation of combined exposures and complex mixtures as well as models facilitating the interpretation of findings in the context of risk assessment of mixtures have become increasingly important. It is true that exposure of humans to chemical mixtures is the rule rather than the exception, and therefore health risk assessments should focus on mixtures and not on single chemicals. It is also true, however, that humans have learned to cope with exposure to huge numbers of chemicals simultaneously (food, water, air, soil, and consumer products). Therefore, in view of limited resources for toxicological research, the focus in toxicology should be on priority mixtures-priority being determined by (estimated) health risk (= toxicity and exposure). http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/suppl-6/893-899feron/abstract.html.",2002,110,893,899,10.1289/ehp.02110s6893

The pesticide degradation was studied for a period 131 days in orange fruits and for 161 days in orange leaves and soil. The experimental data were used to establish a mathematical model for the decline curves of chlorpyrifos residues as a function of time and to determine the relevant parameters describing such a process. Field trials showed a different degradation rate for EC and WG formulations as compared to ME formulation. For the first two formulations, the dissipation of chlorpyrifos in orange fruits was fast during the first phase and became much slower during the later period. Residue levels of chlorpyrifos from ME remained almost constant for similar to65 days and then began to decrease. A similar behavior was observed for the three chlorpyrifos formulations on orange leaves and soil. Although microencapsulation of pesticides leads to improved handling safety, additional risks for the consumers, the agriculture workers, and the environment should be taken into account due to prolonged persistence of high residue levels in fruits as well as in leaves and soil.",2002,50,5975,5980,10.1021/jf0256687

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of single and binary solvent systems (ethanol, EtOH, and water), a surfactant (6% sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS), and a rubifacient/vasodilator (1.28% methyl nicotinate, MNA) on PCP membrane transport, and to correlate these effects with physiochemical characteristics of the PCP mixtures. Partitioning, diffusion, and absorption parameters of C-14-PCP at low (4 mug/cm(2)) and high (40 mug/cm(2)) doses were assessed in porcine skin and silastic membranes in vitro. In these 8-h, flow-through diffusion studies, PCP was dosed with the following vehicles: 100% EtOH, 100% water, 40% EtOH + 60% water, 40% EtOH + 60% water + SLS, 40% EtOH + 60% water + MNA, and 40% EtOH + 60% water + SLS + MNA. PCP absorption ranged from 1.55-15.62% for the high dose and 0.43-7.20% for the low dose. PCP absorption, flux, and apparent permeability were influenced by PCP solubility, and PCP apparent permeability was correlated with log PC (r2 = 0.66). Although PCP was very soluble in pure ethanol (100%), this vehicle evaporated very rapidly, and PCP absorption in ethanol was the lowest with this vehicle when compared to pure water (100%) or aqueous ethanol mixtures in general. MNA had no significant effect on membrane absorption or relative permeability R(P) in aqueous ethanol solutions, but the presence of the surfactant, SLS, significantly reduced PCP absorption and R(P) in both membrane systems. In conclusion, these studies demonstrated that modification in mixture composition with either a solvent and/or a surfactant can influence PCP diffusion in skin. Physicochemical interactions between these mixture components on the skin surface and stratum corneum contributed significantly to PCP transport, and these interactions were identified by simultaneously assessing chemical diffusion in biological and inert membrane systems.",2002,69,295,305,10.1093/toxsci/69.2.295

These chemicals, however, are also potential penetration enhancers for mammalian skin, The effect of formulation on dermal absorption of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, and trifluralin and their commercial formulations Aatrex, Lasso, and Treflan was determined. In vitro absorption studies were performed by placing hairless mouse skin in a Bronough flow-through diffusion system. Donor solution was spiked with C-14-labeled herbicide, and its penetration through the skin was monitored in 90-min fractions. Results demonstrate that dermal penetration of commercially formulated compound was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the pure compound at the same concentration. The physical properties of a herbicide predicted penetration (r(2) = 0.97-0.99) for commercial formulations but were not as effective at predicting absorption for the pure compounds (r(2) = 0.51-0.71). The solvents associated with the hydrophobic herbicide Treflan altered dermal penetration of the more hydrophilic herbicides Lasso and Aatrex.

Aliquots of the collection medium were withdrawn at regular intervals and acidified, and quantification of the free acid was achieved using HPLC-UV (230 nm). There was no appreciable permeation of the salt formulation over a 24-hour test period. For the ester formulation, the following mean steady-state permeation rate (microg x cm(-2) min(-1)) and mean lag time (hours), respectively, were measured: Viton (0.06, 17.8), natural rubber (0.08, 15.4), neoprene 73 (0.21, 15.1), and nitrile (0.04, 24.2). Permeation was associated with significant swelling, averaging a nearly 30 percent increase from the pre-immersion thickness. All four glove types provide adequate protection against permeation by the salt formulation and at least eight-hour protection against the ester formulation. Given the greater permeation of the ester formulation, the salt formulation of MCPA herbicide should be used whenever possible.",2001,16,961,6,

Three related herbicide formulations were chosen. The first, Agent Orange, consisted only of the butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. The second was Agent Orange diluted with diesel fuel and the third formulation tested was a tree and blackberry killer, which consisted of the butyl ester of 2,4,5-T, the ethyl ester of 2,4-D, diesel fuel and two surfactants. The potential toxic effects of these three formulations were evaluated by determining their inhibitory effects on the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles prepared from beef heart mitochondria. The effective concentration that caused a 50% inhibition of the activities of the submitochondrial particles was determined for all three formulations. When the toxicity of the individual components of these formulations was evaluated, it was established that the so-called 'inert' components i.e. diesel fuel and surfactants contributed approximately 50% of the overall toxicity of the complete formulations. Hence the results confirm the importance of evaluating the toxicity of complete formulations, rather than only focussing on the active components. While cellular and sub-cellular assays cannot account for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that may affect the toxicity of xenobiotics, the sub-mitochondrial particle test is useful as an initial screening assay.

Although this reproductive dysfunction is typically characterized by alterations in serum steroid hormone levels, disruptions in spermatogenesis, and loss of fertility, the mechanisms involved in pesticide-induced infertility remain unclear. Because testicular Leydig cells play a crucial role in male reproductive function by producing testosterone, we used the mouse MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line to study che molecular events involved in pesticide-induced alterations in steroid hormone biosynthesis. We previously showed char, the organochlorine insecticide lindane and the organophosphate insecticide Dimethoate directly inhibit steroidogenesis in Leydig cells by disrupting expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. StAR protein mediates the rate-limiting and acutely regulated step in steroidogenesis, the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) enzyme initiates the synthesis of all steroid hormones. In the present study, we screened eight currently used pesticide formulations for their ability to inhibit steroidogenesis, concentrating on their effects on StAR expression in MA-10 cells. In addition, we determined the effects of these compounds on the levels and activities of the P450scc enzyme (which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone) and the 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) enzyme (which converts pregnenolone to progesterone). Of the pesticides screened, only the pesticide Roundup inhibited dibutyryl [(Bu)(2)]cAMP-stimulated progesterone production in MA-10 cells without causing cellular toxicity Roundup inhibited steroidogenesis by disrupting StAR protein expression, further demonstrating the susceptibility of StAR to environmental pollutants.",2000,108,769,776,10.1289/ehp.00108769

These studies further indicated that this crop growing area used more chlorophenoxy herbicides and fungicides than elsewhere in Minnesota. Based on frequency of use and known biology, certain herbicides, pesticide additives, fungicides, and mycoioxins are suspect agents. To define whether these agents affect developmental endpoints in vitro, 16 selected agrochemicals were examined using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In the flow cytometric assay, cell proliferation in this estrogen-responsive cell line indicates xenobiotic-mediated estrogenic effects. Cell viability, morphology, ploidy, and apoptosis were incorporated in this assay. Data showed that the adjuvants X-77 and Activate Plus induced significant cell proliferation at 0.1 and 1 mu g/ml. The commercial-grade herbicides 2,4-D LV4 and 2,4-D amine induced cell proliferation at 1 and 10 mu g/ml. The reagent-grade 2,4-D products failed to induce proliferation over the same concentration range, suggesting that other ingredients in the commercial products, presumably adjuvants, could De a factor in these results. The fungicides triphenyltin and mancozeb induced apoptosis at concentrations of 4.1 mu g/ml (10(-5) M) and 50 mu g/ml, respectively. Triphenyltin also induced aneuploidy (G2/M arrest) at 0.41 mu g/ml (10(-6) M).

The results showed that Tordon 75D(R) (a mixture of the triisopropanolamine salts of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and its other components) impaired the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles (SMPs). The effective concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of SMP activity (EC(50)s) for Tordon 75D(R) were in the low micromolar range for 2,4-D and picloram in the presence of the other components, while in the absence of the other components exposure to 136 times higher concentrations of the triisopropanolamine forms of 2,4-D and picloram administered as a mixture were required to inhibit the oxidative functions of SMPs. Tordon 75D(R) also significantly decreased the respiratory control ratio of intact rat liver mitochondria. The results show that the toxic effects of Tordon 75D(R) on SMPs (at the EC50) and intact rat liver mitochondria were not due to any additive or synergistic actions of a mixture of its active and other components, but rather were caused solely by the proprietary surfactant. Since mitochondria are responsible for over 90% of the energy production in all eukaryotic organisms, the use of the SMP assay provides a convenient in vitro assay for evaluating cellular toxicity and can be regarded as an informative screening assay when designing chemical products which contain mixtures of chemicals.

Animals-Skin was obtained from the dorsum of 14 female weanling specific-pathogen-free Yorkshire pigs, Procedure-In this 8-hour in vitro flow-through diffusion study, porcine skin sections were dosed with 40 mu g of CA/cm(2) of surface area, different amounts of solvents (40 or 80% acetone or dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), different amounts of a surfactant (0, 1, or 5% sodium lauryl sulfate [SLS]), an insect repellent (0 or 15% diethyl-m-toluamide [DEET]), an insecticide synergist (0 or 2% piperonyl butoxide [PB]), and a CA metabolite (40 mu g/cm(2) 1-naphthol [1-NA]). Results-In general, CA absorption was greater from acetone than from DMSO mixtures, and CA penetration into skin and stratum corneum was greater from DMSO at 8 hours. This is consistent with the flux-time profiles, which depicted initial peak flux within 2 to 3 hours for most acetone mixtures, but a slow increase in flux for DMSO mixtures. Irrespective of the solvent, increasing water content in pesticide dosing mixtures significantly increased CA absorption from SLS mixtures only, The SLS also enhanced CA absorption, especially at low solvent concentrations. The DEET significantly reduced CA absorption from acetone, but not from DMSO mixtures, and 1-NA enhanced CA absorption from acetone, but not from DMSO mixtures. Piperonyl butoxide significantly enhanced CA absorption from acetone and DMSO mixtures, However, addition of PB or PB plus SLS did not significantly increase CA flux above that observed from solvent plus surfactant mixtures. Conclusions-Inert ingredients can modulate percutaneous absorption of toxicologically important pesticides and their effect or activity on CA disposition is dependent on solvent specificity and solvent concentration, Whereas SLS, PB, and 1-NA can enhance pesticide absorption, DEET can reduce absorption.",1998,59,168,175,

Two different preparations were employed, one with acetone as the vehicle and the other, a commercial product, consisting primarily of white spirit as the solvent base. 2 The mean peak plasma concentrations of lindane following exposure to the acetone and white-spirit based applications were 0.91 and 0.47 ng/ml, respectively. The similarity between these levels did not reflect the 40-fold higher dose of lindane in the acetone vehicle. White spirit enhanced the penetration of Lindane with respect to the acetone vehicle, highlighting the influence of vehicle upon percutaneous absorption. Low levels of trichlorophenol glucuronide metabolites, but no lindane, were detected in the urine. 3 The exposure site was washed at 6 h to mimic a decontamination procedure at the end of a working day. The proportion of the applied dose unabsorbed by 6 h was 80% and 10% for the acetone and the white spirit-based formulation, respectively. Small areas of the exposed site were tape stripped at 6 and 24 h to assess any lindane that may be associated with the stratum corneum. High levels were observed in the stratum corneum at 6 h exposure (up to 30% of the applied dose for the white spirit based formulation). However, this level had decreased by 24 h (by at least 90% of the amount found at 6 h). A gauze or gauze/shirt combination covering the application site between 6 and 24 h did account for some of this loss of lindane hem the stratum corneum attributed to friction and removal of exfoliated cells. The unaccounted proportion was presumed to have been absorbed through the skin into the systemic circulation.

The dermal distribution of lindane within the skin was also examined, focusing particularly on any association of lindane to the stratum corneum, The results were then compared with a parellel in vivo study. 2 Two of the formulations contained white spirit as the predominant solvent, and lindane absorption was greatest from these preparations in terms of the percentage of the applied dose (15-25% by 24 h). Absorption was less from an aqueous spray dilution (3% by 24 h), with absorption from acetone being the least (<1% by 24 h). Similar amounts of lindane penetrated by 24 h for the acetone and white spirit-based applications (approx. 8 mu g). This supported the in vivo observation that similar plasma lindane levels were recorded following exposure to the acetone solution and the white spirit-based formulation A, although the lindane concentration in acetone was 40-fold higher. 3 For the acetone and water-based preparations, a soap/water swab of the skin surface at 6 h contained the majority of the applied dose (around 75%). Substantial amounts of lindane were recovered in tape-strippings taken at 6 h (representative of stratum corneum content) which were significantly greater than lindane in the remainder of the skin, for the acetone solution and formulation A.

With a motivation based on these clinical observations, we tried to elucidate the exact component and its mode of action that is mostly responsible for the direct cardiovascular effects of this herbicide formulation, investigating the effects of BASTA, GLA, and AES independently on the cardiovascular system in rats in vitro and in vivo. In isolated right atria beating spontaneously in Krebs-Ringer's solution, BASTA and AES produced negative chronotropic responses in a concentration-dependent manner. In electrically driven isolated left atria, BASTA and AES produced positive inotropic responses concentration dependently but negative inotropic responses at extremely high concentrations. In aortic ring segments, BASTA and AES produced no vasoconstrictive effects but exerted significant vasodilative effects when the aortic ring was precontracted with phenylephrine. These in vitro responses caused by BASTA and AES occurred to a similar degree. On the other hand, the main component, GLA, produced no effects in isolated atria and aortas. In anesthetized rats, relatively low doses of BASTA and AES produced a decrease in blood pressure followed by a slight increase in heart rate, which was presumably due to baroreflex caused by the decrease in blood pressure. At an extremely high dose, BASTA and AES produced a decrease in blood pressure with a marked decrease in heart rate. These in vivo responses to BASTA and AES also occurred to a similar degree. In contrast, the main component, GLA, did not produce any effects on heart rate and blood pressure in anesthetized rats. From these results, we concluded that the effects of BASTA in our in vivo experiments were not caused by the main component, GLA, but was mostly caused by AES through its vasodilative effects plus cardiostimulatory effects at low doses and cardiosuppressive effects at high doses.

This report was presented at the 1994 Interim Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates as Report 4 of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Methods. Information for the report was derived from published literature and from personal communications with state and federal regulatory officials, physicians, and representatives of pest control, lawn care, and farm organizations. Some information about state certification and training programs was obtained from telephone conversations with pesticide applicator training program coordinators from California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. These states were selected because they contain large agricultural or urban populations that are likely to require the services of trained professional pesticide applicators. Results. Current surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems related either to pesticide usage or to pesticide-related illnesses. The effectiveness of applicator certification and training programs and public notification programs could not be determined because of a lack of federal and state survey data for making useful assessments. Conclusions. Considering current data gaps, it is prudent for homeowners, farmers, and workers to limit pesticide exposures to themselves and others.

They were applied at the dosage rate of 50 g Al in 4 L/ha onto potted spruce seedlings in a laboratory spray chamber. Droplet-size spectra and deposits were assessed using Kromekote(R) card/glass plate collection units. Foliar residues [dislodgeable residues (DR), penetrated residues (PR) and total residues (TR)] of AZ-A and their volatilization were measured by HPLC at different intervals of time up to 60 h after treatment. Differences in the droplet-size spectra and deposit levels were observed among the lour spray mixes due to the influence of additives present in them. Dissipation half-lives (DT50) of the DR, PR and TR in the foliage were low (range, 19.5 to 38.9 h) and varied according to the residue type and the spray mix used. The DT50 values of the DR were consistently lower (range, 19.5 to 31.9 h) than those of the PR (range, 30.5 to 38.9 h) due to preferential loss of the surface residues. The low DT50 values observed for the DR and TR in the foliage sprayed with the WP spray mix were attributed to the particulate nature of the deposit. AZ-A volatilized appreciably from the DR rather than from the PR. The variations found in the amounts of AZ-A volatilized (42 to 58%) and unaccountable (38 to 46%) from the initial TR values in spruce foliage, after 60 h, were attributed to the physical form of the deposits on the target surface and the influences of additives present in the different spray mixes.",1997,32,523,544,10.1080/03601239709373101
