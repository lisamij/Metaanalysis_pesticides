However, owing to its irritability, volatility, instability under light/oxygen and hydrophobicity, the application of TTO in pharmaceutical production technology and the food industry is limited. To overcome these problems, TTO nanoemulsions (TTONs) were prepared using a high-speed shearing method. The mean droplets size of TTON was measured. TTON droplets were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy and analysed using a Turbiscan scanning spectrum. The most suitable nanoemulsion formula was obtained as follows: TTO content, 10% (w/w); Tw-40 content, 8% (w/w); deionised water content, 82% (w/w); shearing time, 5 minutes. The antibacterial effect of TTON was studied, and it was found that its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was more potent than that against Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial mechanism of TTON was also investigated by observing bacterial morphology using scanning electron microscopy and testing the levels of bacterial reactive oxygen species. The effect of TTON on L-02 cells was evaluated. The results showed that the cell survival rates of L-02 cells treated with TTON at 0.05-0.25 mu g/mu L were all >90%. At each concentration, the total apoptosis rate of L-02 cells was <10%. These results indicated the high biocompatibility and biological safety of TTON. Therefore, the preparation of TTO into a nanoemulsion can improve its bioavailability, which has positive implications for further applications of TTO."

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment."

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that inert ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure. This finding suggests that pesticides produce the inhibitory effect on enzymes through other mechanisms."

Still, adverse environmental and human health effects resulting from its application have been reported. In this study, the possibility of readjusting the formulation of a commercial product combining azoxystrobin and tebuconazole (active ingredients - AIs; Custodia (R)) towards environmentally safer alternative(s) was investigated. Specifically, the sensitivity of non-target aquatic communities to each AI was first evaluated by applying the Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) approach. Then, mixtures of these AIs were tested in a non-target organism (Raphidocelis subcapitata) denoting sensitivity to both AIs as assessed from SSDs. The resulting data supported the design of the last stage of this study, where mixtures of those AIs at equivalent vs. alternative ratios and rates as in the commercial formulation were tested against two target fungal species: Pyrenophora teres CBS 123929 and Rhynchosporium secalis CBS 110524. The comparison between the sensitivity of non-target aquatic species and the corresponding efficacy towards target fungi revealed that currently applied mixture and rates of these AIs are generally environmentally safe (antagonistic interaction; concentrations below the EC1 for R. subcapitata and generally below the HC5 for aquatic non-target communities), but ineffective against target organisms (maximum levels of inhibition of 70 and 50% in P. teres CBS 123929 and R. secalis CBS 110524, respectively). Results additionally suggest a potentiation of the effects of the AIs by the other formulants added to the commercial product at tested rates. Overall, this study corroborates that commercial products can be optimized during design stages based on a systematic ecotoxicological testing for ingredient interactions and actual efficacy against targets. This could be a valuable pathway to reduce environmental contamination during transition to a more sustainable agricultural production."

FaPEx strategy comprising of two simple steps. Firstly, the sample was placed in the syringe and extracted using low-volume acetonitrile with NaCl and anhydrous MgSO4 salts. Secondly, the extractant was passed through in-syringe-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) kit containing cleanup sorbents and salt combinations (C18, primary secondary amine, and anhydrous MgSO4) for the cleanup process. Then, the obtained clean extractant was injected into LC-MS/MS for the quantification of target analytes. Various important parameters influencing the FaPEx performances, such as solvent type, salt type, salt amount, sorbent type, and amount, were examined and optimized. The method validation results showed excellent linearity with high correlation coefficients were >= 0.99. The estimated LODs were between 0.05-0.07 mu g/kg, and LOQs ranged between 0.1-0.25 mu g/kg for target analytes in both egg and soil sample matrices, and precision values were <= 7.90%. The developed method was applied to commercial chicken egg samples and environmental soil samples analysis. Spiked recoveries ranged between 88.75-110.91% for egg samples with RSDs <= 7.42% and 82.47-107.46% for soil samples with RSDs <7.37%. These results proved that the developed sample preparation method is a simple, fast, green, low-cost, and efficient method for the analysis of fipronil and its metabolites in food and environmental samples. Thus, this method can be applied as an alternative analytical methodology in routine and standard food and environmental testing laboratories."

The prepared fenpro-pathrin nanoemulsion exhibited suitable stability and remarkable insecticidal activity against Helicoverpa armigera. The optimal formula in compliance with the standard of FAO was obtained. Fenpropathrin (10 wt%) and ethoxylated castor oil (EL-10: EL-40 = 2: 1, 9 wt%) were dissolved, mixed with hydrocarbon solvent (S-200, 8 wt%) and replenished with deionized water to obtain 100 wt%. The nanoemulsion droplets showed small contact angle and high adhesion work onto corn leaves, indicating that the nanoemulsions exhibited excellent wetting, adhesion and stretching capabilities. Compared with commercial emulsifiable concentrate (EC), the nanoemulsion had lower LC50 (50.01 mg L-1) against the third instar larva of Helicoverpa armigera. This was due to the body of larvae becoming completely darkened, shriveled and incapacitated shortly after treatment. The LC50 of the fenpropathrin nanoemulsion on Eisenia fetida was 96.60 and 47.99 mg kg-1 after 7 and 14 days, respectively. This indicated low toxicity to E. fetida. The L02 cell viability after 24 and 48 h of nanoemulsion treatment was 85.32 % and 68.95 %, respectively. In addition, the fenpropathrin nanoemulsion showed a lower apoptosis rate against L02 cells (8.52 %) than EC (63.18 %) after 24 h, indicating that the nanoemulsion had low cytotoxicity against L02 cells. In general, the utilization and environmental performance of pesticides were improved, with less cytotoxicity. This study will facilitate the preparation and application of nanoemulsions for lipophilic pesticide to enhance insecticidal activity, lower cytotoxicity and improve environmental compatibility."

While the survival rates were not affected, sublethal effects were evidenced after exposure. The most frequent deformities were fin damage and axial and thoracic damage. The mixture of active ingredients caused an increase in SOD and GST, differing from the treatment with the mixture of commercial formulations. The activity of AChE was significantly reduced following the treatment with the active ingredient atrazine and in the mixture of active ingredients. In general, herbicide mixtures were responsible for causing more toxic effects to R. quelen embryos. Therefore, these responses showed to be suitable biomarkers of herbicides' exposure, in addition to generating more environmentally relevant baseline data for re-stablishing safety levels of these substances in aquatic bodies."

They are highly water-soluble, persistent in soil, may enter the aquatic compartment via spray drift, runoff, or leaching, and contribute to downstream aquatic toxicity. Although insects appear to be the most sensitive group to neonicotinoids, other groups, such as crus-taceans, may also be affected. Furthermore, most studies focus on single-insecticide exposure and very little is known concerning the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures on aquatic invertebrates. The present study was designed to test potential toxicological effects of an environmentally relevant mixture of imidacloprid, clothia-nidin, and thiamethoxam on populations of Ceriodaphnia dubia and Daphnia magna under controlled conditions. Chronic toxicity tests were conducted in the laboratory, and survival and reproduction were measured for both species under environmentally relevant, 'worst-case' concentrations for each compound separately and in combination as pesticides are often detected as mixtures in aquatic environments. The neonicotinoids did not appear to affect the survival of C. dubia and D. magna. Reproduction of C. dubia was affected by the mixture whereas all three individual insecticides as well as the mixture caused a significant reduction in the reproduction of D. magna. Our results highlight the complexity of pesticide toxicity and show that traditional toxicological approaches such as, acute mortality studies and tests with single compounds can underestimate negative impacts that occur in the environment."

Two formulation agents of toxicological concern, Naphthalene and Solvent Naphtha (Petroleum), Heavy Aromatic, were simulated from their usage in commercially-applied pesticides. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate these formulation agents during 2011-2014 in the agriculturally intensive Sacramento River watershed. The sensitivity and uncertainty of some key parameters were analyzed. The predicted transport masses of these formulation agents in surface water were strongly associated with rainfall. While predicted transport masses were quite small at the watershed scale (<0.01% of applied masses), they were 26-31 times higher in certain locales at the subbasin level. Since many formulation agents are widely used in pesticides throughout this and other agri-culturally impacted watersheds, their potential risks in the environment need more thorough investigation by modeling and monitoring, especially for areas with heavy usage."

Studies show that even herbicides can negatively impact bees, causing death or compromising health. As a result, concern about the use of glyphosate (GLY) has increased, as it is the most sold pesticide. Studies have shown that exposure of bees to GLY can trigger sublethal effects. Considering the speed with which information is published, reviews become important for the integration of knowledge, aiding understanding of the topic. Therefore, the present study aimed to review the literature on the sublethal effects of GLY and the different commercial formulations on bees. After the literary review, it was observed that the exposition, acute and chronic, of larvae and adults of social and solitary bees, to GLY and its formulations, can trigger alterations in gene expression, enzyme functioning, oxidative metabolism, cell/tissue structure, intestinal microbiota diversity, learning, food consumption, flight and vertical displacement capacity, circadian cycle and body development of these insects. The most used species in the studies was Apis mellifera L. Studies are still necessary to understand the sublethal effects of GLY on bees, in the medium and long term, on colony homeostasis, especially about the information on the toxicity of some surfactants present in the different commercial formulations."

Pesticides are one of the most recognised pollutants worldwide. Carbamates are a widely used pesticide family, and bendiocarb is a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide detected in surface and groundwater. In the present work, acute lethal and chronic effects of bendiocarb on the early life stages of freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis were investigated. 24-h LC50 of bendiocarb on L. stagnalis embryos and juveniles was estimated at 20.39 (18.30-22.71) mg/L and 38.35 (29.58-52.89) mg/L, respectively. Chronic tests were conducted for 21-d to evaluate the potential effects of the environmentally realistic concentrations of bendiocarb (5 and 100 mu g/L) on the embryos. Mortality, development, growth (embryo: egg ratio and shell height), heart rate, and hatching success were investigated. The test results showed that mortality, developmental progression, embryo: egg ratio, shell height measurements and cumulative hatching rate were not significantly impaired by chronic bendiocarb exposure compared to the control. However, bendiocarb induced increased heart rate in the exposed snails."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and mixture effects of fipronil, glyphosate and imidacloprid in human HepG2 cells. Cytotoxicity was evaluated after 48-h incubations through MTT reduction and neutral red uptake assays. Free radicals production, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA damage, and release of liver enzymes were also evaluated. Data obtained for individual agents were used to compute the additivity expectations for two mixtures of definite composition (one equipotent mixture, based in the EC50 values achieved in the MTT assay; the other one based in the acceptable daily intake of each pesticide), using the models of concentration addition and independent action. The EC50 values for fipronil, glyphosate and imidacloprid were 37.59, 41.13, and 663.66 mg/L, respectively. The mixtures of pesticides elicited significant synergistic effects (p < 0.05), which were greater than the expected by both addictive predictions. Decreased in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased in the transaminases enzymatic activities were observed. As they occur simultaneously, interactions between pesticides, even at non-effective single levels, can reverberate in significant deleterious effects, justifying the need for a more realistic approach in safety evaluations to better predict the effects to human health."

In this context, the present study aims to raise awareness of the toxicological impact of pesticides on human health in pediatrics. For this purpose, the demographic characteristics, clinical assessment, and outcome of pediatric patients with acute pesticide poisoning admitted to the toxicology department of Saint Mary Emergency Children's Hospital from Iasi, were analyzed. This retrospective study focused on the clinical and laboratory data of patients aged under 18 years diagnosed with acute pesticide poisoning between 2010-2020. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 10 package. A total of 49 patients presented with manifestations of acute pesticide poisoning, and the most common pesticide involved was diazinon. The most frequent exposure route was accidentally ingesting pesticide products (95%). The primary clinical manifestations were toxic encephalopathy, coma, depressive disorder, gastric disorders, and respiratory failure. Changes in the glycemic status, liver, and kidney damage were also present. Treatment included decontamination, administration of antidote, supportive care, and recommendations to be closely monitored to avoid a new incident. These results highlight the toxic potential of pesticides on human health and their biological consequences, which require an increase in consciousness of the precautions imposed on their use, especially when children are nearby."

Due to their high use, their toxic residues have enormously increased in the agroecosystem in the past several years. They have caused many severe threats to non-target organisms, including humans. Therefore, the complete removal of toxic compounds is gaining wide attention to protect the ecosystem and the diversity of living organisms. Several methods, such as physical, chemical and biological, are applied to degrade compounds, but as compared to other methods, biological methods are considered more efficient, fast, eco-friendly and less expensive. In particular, employing microbial species and their purified enzymes makes the degradation of toxic pollutants more accessible and converts them into non-toxic products by several metabolic pathways. The digestive tract of insects is usually known as a superior organ that provides a nutrient-rich environment to hundreds of microbial species that perform a pivotal role in various physiological and ecological functions. There is a direct relationship between pesticides and insect pests: pesticides reduce the growth of insect species and alter the phyla located in the gut microbiome. In comparison, the insect gut microbiota tries to degrade toxic compounds by changing their toxicity, increasing the production and regulation of a diverse range of enzymes. These enzymes breakdown into their derivatives, and microbial species utilize them as a sole source of carbon, sulfur and energy. The resistance of pesticides (carbamates, pyrethroids, organophosphates, organochlorines, and neonicotinoids) in insect species is developed by metabolic mechanisms, regulation of enzymes and the expression of various microbial detoxifying genes in insect guts. This review summarizes the toxic effects of agrochemicals on humans, animals, birds and beneficial arthropods. It explores the preferential role of insect gut microbial species in the degradation process and the resistance mechanism of several pesticides in insect species. Additionally, various metabolic pathways have been systematically discussed to better understand the degradation of xenobiotics by insect gut microbial species."

This herbicide can impact the mosquito life cycle through being carried to mosquito habitats by runoff. This study investigates the effects of glyphosate on the larval development and oviposition of a laboratory colony of Culex quinquefasciatus. Our experiments indicated that a concentration of 1 g/liter glyphosate was lethal to larval instars or the larvae impacted were either unable to molt to pupae or never emerged as adults. Larval instars exposed to 0.5 g/liter glyphosate experienced a similar impact; however, the larval stage was extended and pupation was considerably delayed. Mosquitoes oviposited in 0.5 g/liter glyphosate laid the same number of egg rafts as in water, but a considerably lower number of eggs exposed to glyphosate hatched as first instars. If gravid females laid their eggs in 1 g/liter glyphosate versus water, the difference between the 2 groups would be statistically significant and a very low number of eggs exposed to glyphosate could ever hatch into larvae. In an oviposition assay carried out in a cage with 3 choices of water, 0.5 g/liter, and 1 g/liter glyphosate, a higher number of egg rafts were laid in water, followed by 0.5 g/liter and 1 g/liter glyphosate concentrations, respectively.

Nevertheless, success in the control of RKN depends on the compatibility of the fungus with pesticides used to manage other pests and diseases. We tested the in vitro acute and chronic effects of twelve different commercial pesticides used throughout a tomato cropping cycle on P. chlamydosporia. All pesticides significantly inhibited radial growth of the fungus at 22 days, with exception of methiocarb (Mesurol 200), spiromesifen (Oberon), copper-metalaxyl-M (Ridomil Gold R) and oxamyl (Vydate 10L). All fungicides produced significant acute and chronic negative effects on chlamydospore viability. Insecticides methiocarb, spinosad (Spintor) and indoxacarb (Steward) did not affect chlamydospore germination at the tested concentration of active substance (100 mg center dot L-1) of pesticide in the acute effects test, but all tested pesticides significantly reduced chlamydospore viability in the chronic 6-week-exposure test. Importantly, chlamydospore germination rates recorded were higher in the 12-week than in the 6-week-exposure chronic test, hinting at P. chlamydosporia acclimation or recovery. In view of differences in compatibility of commercial pesticides with P. chlamydosporia, acting on different fungal life stages in acute and chronic processes, these must be carefully selected and the timing of their application considered in the design of crop protection strategies against RKN to improve the biological control success."

Our results indicated that the adjuvant was able to enhance the efficacy of both methoxyfenozide and spinosad against L. botrana at each interval. The increased efficacy was due to the lower values of surface tension and to the improved contact angle parameters of the spray solutions. By adding adjuvant in the spraying liquid, it was possible to have a control efficiency very similar to the treatment using the recommended rates, even when the application rate was reduced by 20%. Our results underline the importance of adjuvants in improving the field efficacy of insecticides against L. botrana."

These include active ingredients intended to kill pests, and so-called inert ingredients intended to improve the physical characteristics of the product. In addition, shortly before applying a pesticide product, applicators often mix adjuvants into the sprayer tank. Adjuvants are products designed to improve the performance or physical properties of a pesticide spray mixture. Manufacturers may use a particular chemical compound both as an inert ingredient within pesticide products and as a component of adjuvant products. Nonetheless, regulations dictate that data on use are publicly available only for the portion used in adjuvants. Adjuvants are exempt from federal registration, but are defined as pesticides in California. Based on that definition, California has identified a-(p-nonylphenyl)-x-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) (APNOHO) as the most widely used pesticide in the state, applied to more than 10 million acres annually. That quantified use includes only agricultural acres treated with adjuvants containing APNOHO. Total APNOHO use is likely higher because manufacturers also use the chemical as an inert ingredient within pesticide products, although data on such use are shielded by regulation. OBJECTIVES: We use APNOHO as a case study to demonstrate that the use of adjuvants and inert ingredients is difficult to track because relevant information is not publicly available. We synthesize information that suggests widespread agricultural use of alkylphenol ethoxylates, such as APNOHO, may pose significant human and environmental health risks. We then make recommendations for future research and policy. METHODS: We used information from California???s pesticide use reporting system and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate use of APNOHO. We used U.S. EPA and European databases, as well as published research, to identify human and environmental health hazards of APNOHO. We focused on research showing that APNOHO is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. DISCUSSION: Within California, APNOHO is applied in more than 150 adjuvant products. Nationwide, it is used as an inert ingredient in at least 650 pesticide products. Exposure to APNOHO is associated with endocrine disruption, birth defects, and aquatic toxicity. We suggest that the case of APNOHO illustrates the larger problem of a lack of publicly available data on use and toxicity of many adjuvants and pesticide inert ingredients. We recommend that researchers and regulators include adjuvants and inert ingredients when evaluating pesticide hazards, including endocrine disruption. We also recommend regulatory requirements to identify all ingredients on product labels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634"

In this study, an excellent adhesive nanocapsule loaded with emamectin benzoate (Eb@PDA) was prepared via emulsion interfacial polymerization based on the self-polymerization ability and adhesion properties of polydopamine (PDA). Results The physicochemical properties of the Eb@PDA were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, particle size statistics, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Eb@PDA presented a regular spherical shape, with an average particle size of 163.8 nm. Compared with conventional formulations, it had higher pesticide-loading content (34%) and excellent adhesion onto corn leaf. In addition, Eb@PDA showed sustained-release characteristics, facilitating the release of Eb at low pH and high temperature. Eb@PDA could effectively protect Eb against photodegradation and had a longer effective period for controlling Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodoptera exigua. Furthermore, acute toxicity tests showed that the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) was 80.91 and 57.91 mg kg(-1) at 7 and 14 days, respectively, indicating a lower toxicity of the Eb@PDA to earthworms. The cells (L02) treated with Eb@PDA showed a higher cell viability but a lower apoptosis rate (only 5.75%), demonstrating the lower cytotoxicity of the Eb@PDA. Conclusion The self-prepared Eb@PDA could be used as a formulation with the advantages of slow release, UV shielding, strong leaf adhesion, superior insecticidal properties, sustained effectiveness and biosafety. It will also facilitate the development of an efficient and safe pesticide delivery system. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."

The review was restricted to mammalian studies of behavior, neuropathology, and neuropharmacology; in vitro and other biochemical studies were considered supplementary information. Glyphosate formulation studies were also considered, despite uncertainties regarding toxicities of the formulated products; no studies used a formulation vehicle as the control. Inclusion criteria were developed a priori to ensure consistent evaluation of studies, and in vivo investigations were also ranked using ToxRTool software to determine reliability. There were 27 in vivo studies (open literature and available regulatory reports), but 11 studies were considered unreliable (mostly due to critical methodological deficiencies). There were only seven acceptable investigations on glyphosate alone. Studies differed in terms of dosing scenarios, experimental designs, test species, and commercial product. Limitations included using only one dose and/or one test time, small sample sizes, limited data presentation, and/or overtly toxic doses. While motor activity was the most consistently affected endpoint (10 of 12 studies), there were considerable differences in outcomes. In six investigations, there were no marked neuropathological changes in the central or peripheral nervous system. Other neurological effects were less consistent, and some outcomes were less convincing due to influences including high variability and small effect sizes. Taken together, these studies do not demonstrate a consistent impact of glyphosate on the structure or function of the mammalian nervous system."

However, empirically measured pesticide dissipation half-lives are highly variable and the accurate prediction with models is challenging. This study utilized a dataset of pesticide dissipation half-lives containing 1363 datapoints, 311 pesticides, 10 plant types, and 4 plant component classes. Novel dissipation half-life intervals were proposed and predicted to account for high variations in empirical data. Four machine learning models (i.e., gradient boosting regression tree [GBRT], random forest [RF], supporting vector classifier [SVC], and logistic regression [LR]) were developed to predict dissipation half-life intervals using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP), temperature, plant type, and plant component class as model inputs. GBRT-ECFP had the best model performance with F1-microbinary score of 0.698 +/- 0.010 for the binary classification compared with other machine learning models (e.g., LR-ECFP, F1-micro binary= 0.662 +/- 0.009). Feature importance analysis of molecular structures in the binary classification identified aromatic rings, carbonyl group, organophosphate, =C-H, and N-containing heterocyclic groups as important substructures related to pesticide dissipation half-lives.

Through chronic exposure (21 days) of two generations, we observed effects on survival, reproductive capacity and responses of the antioxidant defense system (catalase) and biotransformation system (glutathione S-transferase). The survival of organisms was affected in the second generation (F1) with a mortality of 17% in the mixture of commercial formulations treatments. In the evaluation of the first generation (F0) we observed only effects on sexual maturation of organisms, while in the F1, changes were observed in all parameters evaluated. A statistical difference (p < 0.05) was also observed between the analytical standards and the commercial formulations for all parameters evaluated, indicating that other components present in the formulations can change the toxicity of products. We suggest that atrazine can modulate toxicity when mixed with glyphosate, as the standard analytical atrazine and mixture of analytical standards results were similar in most parameters.

Sixteen bacterial strains were isolated through enrichment and one strain, Rhodococcus soli G41, demonstrated a high removal rate of glyphosate than other strains. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize distinct environmental factors on glyphosate degradation of G41 strain. The optimal conditions for the maximum glyphosate degradation were found to have the NH4Cl concentration of 0.663% and glyphosate concentration of 0.115%, resulting in a maximum degradation of 42.7% after 7 days. Bioremediation analysis showed 47.1% and 40% of glyphosate in unsterile soil and sterile soil was removed by G41 strain after 14 days, respectively. The presence of soxB gene in G41 strain indicates that the glyphosate is degraded via the eco-friendly sarcosine pathway.

Although these methods have been playing a significant part in the pesticide's degradation, there are still gaps in many aspects. Here, we review the catalytic degradation of these pollutants by (metallo)porphyrins. To evaluate the P450 cytochrome's biomimetic behavior of these catalysts, various synthesized porphyrins have been used since 1999 and their activities were summarized in this manuscript. The porphyrins appear to act as good catalysts for the degradation of pesticides; in fact, they also have been shown as a useful tool for the elucidation of their degradation products.

The adjuvant ACTTRA SWD, when mixed with a suitable insecticide, constitutes an innovative attract-and-kill tactic that can be applied as a sprayable bait to manage D. suzukii. As an adjuvant, growers can mix ACTTRA SWD with any insecticide recommended for D. suzukii management in a specific crop; however, to achieve this, the efficacy of this adjuvant incorporated with various insecticides needs testing. This research aims to test the suitability of nine insecticides added to two ACTTRA SWD formulations (named OR1 and TD) to maintain the formulation's attractiveness to D. suzukii adults and in resulting mortality. We conducted a series of two-choice bioassays to test the relative attraction of D. suzukii to ACTTRA SWD formulations prepared with and without a specific insecticide. Additionally, we tested the efficacy of ACTTRA SWD formulations mixed with insecticides in managing D. suzukii by using no-choice efficacy bioassays. Adding Mustang Maxx (zeta-cypermethrin) to ACTTRA SWD OR1 significantly improved D. suzukii adult attraction to the formulation, while Azera (azadirachtin + pyrethrins) significantly reduced attraction to both ACTTRA SWD formulations. Among the insecticides tested, we identified Danitol (fenpropathrin), Exirel (cyantraniliprole), Malathion (malathion), Mustang Maxx, and Entrust (spinosad) as suitable insecticide additives for both ACTTRA SWD formulations.

To overcome these problems, carvacrol can be loaded into nanoemulsions. In this study, carvacrol-loaded nanoemulsions (CNs) were formulated and characterized, and the most suitable emulsifier was selected. The optimized formula of CNs by Box-Behnken design was: carvacrol 5%, emulsifier (Tween-80) at 8% and the shearing time of 7 min. The antibacterial activity of this optimum formulation of CNs was evaluated by the measurement of inhibition zone diameter, minimum inhibitory concentration, and mini-mum bactericidal concentration. The antibacterial mechanism of CNs was also studied by scanning electron microscopy, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and intracellular lysate leakage. CNs damaged the structure of bacterial cells and the permeability of bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the leakage of cellular contents from bacteria. Also, at the same concentration, CNs had a higher cell survival rate and less apoptosis compared with commercial carvacrol aqueous solution; therefore, CNs had a higher biological safety. The final formulation solved the volatility and instability of carvacrol during use, along with providing a new technology for preparing CNs with a long-term stability and good antibacterial activity."

The aim of the present meta-analytic review is to investigate the toxic effects of 2,4-D, based on a compilation of results from different studies, which were synthesized to form a statistically reliable conclusion about the lethal effect of potentially ecological concentrations of 2,4-D in several animal species. The search was carried out in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the selection process was over, 87 datasets were generated and analyzed. The overall effect has indicated significant increase in the mortality rate recorded for animals exposed to environmental concentrations of 2,4-D compared to the control in the experiment (unexposed animals). The segregation of animals into taxonomic categories has shown that fish and birds presented higher mortality rates after exposure to the investigated substance. The present meta-analysis indicated larval and adult animals were susceptible among the ontogenetic development stages. Juvenile individuals exposed to different 2,4-D concentrations did not show significant difference in comparison to the control. Organisms exposed to 2,4-D immersion were the most impacted compared to those exposed by oral, spray and contact. Animals subjected to commercial formulation presented higher mortality rate than the analytical standard. Thus, 2,4-D can, in fact, increase mortality rate in animals, but it depends on species sensitivity, life stage and exposure route. This is the first meta-analytical study evaluating the mortality rate after 2,4-D exposure in several animal species."

A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here.

The considered pesticides were the acetamiprid- and thiacloprid based products Mospilan 20 SG and Calypso 480 SC, respectively. The dose-dependent variation in the three biological endpoints considered were assessed following 24 h exposures. The two neonicotinoid formulations elicited significant depression on the thoracic limb activity and heart rate of daphnids at doses close to the immobility thresholds of formulations (48h-EC50: Mospilan 20 SG = 190 mg L-1; Calypso 480 SC = 120 mg L-1), an effect mainly attributable to the overall drop in the general health status of the organisms. The alterations in the physiological traits were significant at exposures to 190 mg L-1 for Mospilan 20 SG and 48 mg L-1 for Calypso 480 SC. The dose related variation in the ECOD activity of daphnids exposed to the selected neonicotinoid formulations followed a biphasic pattern, with starting effective doses for Mospilan 20 SG of 6.3 mg L-1 (=1/20 of 48h-EC50 for Daphnia neonates), and for Calypso 480 SC of 0.034 mg L-1 (=1/4000 of 48h-EC50).

Efficacy was evaluated 1 d after treatment (DAT) and then at 7d interval until 21 DAT. Scorch (R) was able to improve the efficacy of both the insecticides against L. botrana at all DAT intervals. The higher efficacy was supported by the lower values of the surface tension and the contact angle parameters of the spray solutions. By reducing the insecticides application rates by 20 per cent and adding adjuvant in the spraying liquid, the control efficiency was very similar to that of the treatment with the recommended rates. The results underscore the importance of adjuvants to improve the field efficacy of insecticides against L. botrana."

CI is characterized by multisystem symptoms and new-onset intolerances that develop in a subset of individuals following a major chemical exposure event or repeated low-level exposures. While Toxicant-Induced Loss of Tolerance (TILT) is a two-stage disease mechanism proposed to explain CI, less is known about the exposures that initiate the disease, than about the intolerances that have been documented. Methods We reviewed eight major exposure events that preceded onset of chemical intolerance in groups of individuals sharing the same exposure. Our goal was to identify the chemicals and/or groups of chemicals that were most pervasive during each exposure event as well as identify the concentrations of key chemicals involved in each exposure event and the proportions of exposed individuals who ultimately developed TILT following exposure. Case studies we selected for review included (1) workers at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters during renovations; (2) Gulf War veterans; (3) pesticide exposure among casino workers; (4) exposure to aircraft oil fumes; (5) the World Trade Center tragedy; (6) surgical implants; (7) moldy environments; and (8) tunnel workers exposed to solvents. Results Mixed volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs), followed by pesticides and combustion products were most prevalent across TILT initiation events. As a broader category, synthetic organic chemicals and their combustion products were the primary exposures associated with chemical intolerance. Such chemicals included pesticides, peroxides, nerve agents, anti-nerve agent drugs, lubricants and additives, xylene, benzene, and acetone. Conclusion A select group of exposures were predominant in several major initiating events, suggesting their potential role in TILT initiation. Such insights are useful to public health scientists, physicians, and policymakers seeking to minimize harmful exposures and prevent future disease."

Glyphosate is the world's most used pesticide and it is used without the mitigation measures that could reduce the exposure of pollinators to it. However, studies are starting to suggest negative impacts of this pesticide on bees, an essential group of pollinators. Accordingly, whether glyphosate, alone or alongside other stressors, is detrimental to bee health is a vital question. Bees are suffering declines across the globe, and pesticides, including glyphosate, have been suggested as being factors in these declines. Methods. Here we test, across a range of experimental paradigms, whether glyphosate impacts a wild bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris. In addition, we build upon existing work with honey bees testing glyphosate-parasite interactions by conducting fully crossed experiments with glyphosate and a common bumble bee trypanosome gut parasite, Crithidia bombi. We utilised regulatory acute toxicity testing protocols, modified to allow for exposure to multiple stressors. These protocols are expanded upon to test for effects on long term survival (20 days). Microcolony testing, using unmated workers, was employed to measure the impacts of either stressor on a proxy of reproductive success. This microcolony testing was conducted with both acute and chronic exposure to cover a range of exposure scenarios. Results. We found no effects of acute or chronic exposure to glyphosate, over a range of timespans post-exposure, on mortality or a range of sublethal metrics. We also found no interaction between glyphosate and Crithidia bombi in any metric, although there was conflicting evidence of increased parasite intensity after an acute exposure to glyphosate. In contrast to published literature, we found no direct impacts of this parasite on bee health. Our testing focussed on mortality and worker reproduction, so impacts of either or both of these stressors on other sublethal metrics could still exist. Conclusions. Our results expand the current knowledge on glyphosate by testing a previously untested species, Bombus terrestris, using acute exposure, and by incorpo-rating a parasite never before tested alongside glyphosate. In conclusion our results find that glyphosate, as an active ingredient, is unlikely to be harmful to bumble bees either alone, or alongside Crithidia bombi."

However, GBH encompass a variety of glyphosate salts as active ingredient and different adjuvants, which differ between products. These herbicides reach water bodies and produce diverse impacts over aquatic communities. Yet, the risk assessment assays required for the approval focus mostly on active ingredients. Herein, we compared the effect of five different GBH as well as of monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA) on aquatic microbial communities from natural shallow lakes that were mixed and allowed to evolve in an outdoor pond. We performed an 8-day long assay under indoor control conditions to evaluate the effects of exposure on the structure of nano-plus microphytoplankton (net phytoplankton, with sizes between 2 and 20 mu m and >20 mu m, respectively) and picoplankton (size ranging between 0.2 and 2 mu m) communities through microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Significantly different effects were evident on the structure of microbial communities dependent on the GBH, even with herbicides sharing similar active ingredients. Each GBH evoked increases of different magnitude in bacterioplankton abundance. Furthermore, GIPA and a formulation decreased the abundance of a phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) picocyanobacteria (Pcy) cytometric population and GIPA further altered Pcy composition. Also, two GBH increased net phytoplankton total abundance and, unlike the tested GBH, no apparent effect of GIPA was detected on this community structure. These results demonstrate that GBH effects on aquatic microbial communities should not be summarized as glyphosate effects considering that the formulations have effects beyond those exerted by the active ingredients alone. This work intends to alert on the lack of real knowledge regarding the consequences of the variety of GBH on natural aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, the wide use of the term glyphosate effect should be thoroughly rethought."

However, the modifying effect of co-ingredients on skin uptake and glove barrier protection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to understand the role of formulation co-ingredients in skin and glove barrier protection performance against organophosphate insecticides. RESULTS We adapted standard in vitro diffusion cell methods to test permeation kinetics of two commonly used organophosphate insecticides: dimethoate and omethoate. For spray dilutions, dimethoate and omethoate did not reach breakthrough glove permeation rate (1 mu g center dot cm(-2)center dot min(-1)) and no or little skin permeation was observed for up to 8 h, regardless of formulation. For exposure conditions involving highly concentrated products, significant differences in glove permeation were observed between different formulations of dimethoate (about 1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and of omethoate (184-fold, P < 0.001). In contrast, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed between formulations in terms of skin permeation. CONCLUSION These results suggest that co-ingredients play a critical role in glove barrier protection against undiluted organophosphate insecticides, whereas their influence on skin uptake was insignificant within the exposure time tested. This implies that dermal exposure risk may vary between handling different formulated products of the same active ingredient hence recommending a common glove material for different formulations of the same chemical without careful consideration of co-ingredients and their permeation properties may not necessarily be appropriate."

It targets the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which lacks in humans, suggesting to confer a low mammalian toxicity to G-based herbicides (GBHs). Despite this, the use of G is currently under intense debate. Many studies indicating its hazard and toxicity on non-target organisms are emerging, and associations between GBHs and immune-endocrine disturbances have been described. This review aims to investigate, based on recent epidemiological studies and studies performed in vitro and in vivo in animals, the possible association between GBHs and immune-endocrine alterations. Published data suggest that GBHs have endocrine disrupting potentiality targeting sex and thyroid hormones, although its relevance for humans will require further investigations. Evidence of immunotoxicity are limited compared to those on endocrine effects, but overall highlight possible noxious effects, including lung inflammation and rhinitis. An attractive hypothesis could be the one that connects microbiota dysbiosis with possible immune-endocrine outcomes. Indeed, several intestinal microorganisms express the enzyme EPSPS and, studies are emerging that highlight a possible G-induced dysbiosis. Considering the wide use of GBHs in agriculture, further studies investigating their noxious effects at levels relevant for human exposure should be performed. A critical analysis of emerging evidence of G toxicity is required to better characterize its safety profile. In addition, attention should be paid to the differences between G alone and its formulations, which, containing substances able to increase G absorption, may present a different toxicity profile."

Risk assessment (via Hazard Quotient approach - HQ) was based on the hazardous concentrations for 95% of the species (HC5), derived from chronic Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) for clothianidin, and on its predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). Four SSD scenarios were generated with literature and/or this study data, following different data selection criteria (i.e., general, only data from tests using similar formulations, similar soils, or identical soil/formulation). In our experiments, a higher clothianidin toxicity (EC50-based) was found for collembolans (varying from 0.11 to 0.28 mg kg(-1) between species) followed by the earthworms (4.35 mg kg(-1)), while the enchytraeids were the least sensitive (33.5 mg kg(-1)). HQ indicated a significant risk of clothianidin to soil invertebrates because the estimated PEC were at least 16.6 times higher than HC5 and are expected to affect the whole group of collembolans. Despite the criteria for data inclusion have influenced the HC5 values, no substantial changes were observed for the risk outcomes.

Because of their long hydraulic residence time and large water volumes, they mitigate pesticide concentrations between upstream and downstream rivers. However, pesticide transformation products may also be responsible for the degradation of environments, owing to their presence at high concentrations and their persistence, but related data are scarce, particularly because of their high level of molecular diversity.

While glycine is an essential amino acid generally recognized safe, both epidemiological and toxicological in vivo and in vitro studies available in literature report conflicting findings on the toxicity of GBHs. In our earlier in vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats we observed that exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, induced different toxic effects relating to sexual development, endocrine system, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiome. In the present work, we aimed to comparatively test in in vitro models the cytotoxicity of glycine and GBHs.Methods: We tested the cytotoxic effects of glycine, glyphosate, and its formulation Roundup Bioflow at different doses using MTT and Trypan Blue assays in human Caco2 and murine L929 cell lines.Results: Statistically significant dose-related cytotoxic effects were observed in MTT and Trypan Blue assays in murine (L929) and human (Caco2) cells treated with glyphosate or Roundup Bioflow.

Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered 'bee safe' by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup(R)) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax.We used three Roundup(R) products, the consumer products Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use and Roundup(R) No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup(R) ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol(R). Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use spray bottle.Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use(R) and 30% mortality with Roundup(R) ProActive(R), over 24 hr. Weedol(R) did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup(R) No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup(R) products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup(R) products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system.These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup(R) products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited.Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems."

Bti-based insecticides are considered highly selective, being Diptera-specific, and supposedly decompose rapidly in the environment. Nevertheless, their safety to non-target species and freshwater ecosystems has been questioned by recent studies, which in fact document possible indirect effects in aquatic food webs such as the decrease of prey availability to predators. This work aimed to evaluate the potential effects of a Bti-based insecticide (VectoBac (R) 12AS) on a freshwater macroinvertebrate community and on stream ecological functions by using artificial microcosm streams. Artificial microcosm streams were colonized with a macroinvertebrate community plus periphyton collected in a stream together with Alnus glutinosa leaf packs. They were exposed for 7 days to different Bti treatments (0, 12, 120, 1200 mu g/L), which are within the recommended concentrations of application in aquatic compartments for blackfly and mosquito control. Besides invertebrate community structure and abundance, effects were evaluated regarding leaf decomposition and primary production as measures of ecosystem functioning. Community structure was significantly altered in all Bti treatments after 7 days of exposure, mostly due to a decline in chironomids, followed by oligochaetes, which both belong to the deposit-feeders' functional group. Direct effects on oligochaetes are surprising and require further research. Also, reductions of leaf decomposition due to Bti-induced sublethal effects on shredders (reduced feeding) or mortality of chironomids (that can also feed on coarse organic matter) observed in our study, represent potential indirect effects of Bti in aquatic ecosystems. Our short-exposure experiment evidenced some negative effects on stream benthic invertebrate communities and on ecosystem functioning that must be considered whenever Bti is used in water bodies for blackfly or mosquito control programs.

This research facilitated the design and fabrication of nanoemulsions for water-insoluble pesticides to enhance the insecticidal activity, lower the cytotoxicity, and reduce environmental pollution of such chemicals."

However, the complicated fabrication process of nanosized carriers and their multi-step chemical modifications greatly restrict the practical applications of nanocarrier-based formulations. To address these issues, herein, self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) based on fungicide fenhexamid (FHA) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) were constructed by the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between FHA and PHMB in water solution without using carriers or adjuvants. The optimal temperature and mass ratio between FHA and PHMB for the formation of NPs were 60 degrees C and 10 : 7, respectively. Obtained spherical NPs with sizes of 50-250 nm were stable in neutral and acidic aqueous mediums and displayed desirable physicochemical properties (strong surface positive charges, low conductivity, high light stability, and good surface activity). Moreover, the combination of FHA and PHMB by the self-assembly of NPs had a synergistic effect on the antimicrobial activity, and NPs exhibited higher activities against Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans, Botrytis cinerea, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum than FHA and PHMB. Furthermore, the results of the genotoxicity evaluation in Vicia faba showed that the prepared NPs did not further increase the cytotoxicity of FHA. Overall, the formation of co-self-assembly nanoparticles of FHA and PHMB via a simple and green approach may be a novel avenue for sustainable plant disease management and provides inspiration to construct new nano-based pesticide formulations."

This is also the case for the insecticide fipronil and the herbicide 2,4-D, which are widely used in many crops. This study aimed at evaluating the individual and mixture toxicity of these pesticides to the tropical amphipod Hyalella meinerti. To this end, acute toxicity tests (96 h) were conducted. Chronic bioassays (10 days) were also carried out, in which the body length and dry biomass were evaluated as endpoints. In addition, a complete factorial mixture chronic toxicity test was carried out. H. meinerti was sensitive to fipronil in the acute toxicity tests, with a LC50-96-h of 0.86 mu g L-1 (95% CI 0.26-0.46), and no acute effects were observed after 2,4-D exposure even at the highest test concentration of 100 mg L-1. In the chronic toxicity tests, all tested concentrations of both pesticides decreased the growth of H. meinerti, in which losses on biomass reached 45% and 65% for 2,4-D and fipronil, respectively. The pesticide mixture indicated antagonism although it still significantly decreased the body growth. The results obtained indicate a high sensitivity of H. meinerti exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations, demonstrating that there are risks for the species in real field conditions."

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures. This emphasizes the importance of a more integrated eco-toxicological assessment of commercial pesticide preparations not to underestimate their effects on the environment."

In aquatic ecosystems, benthic organisms may be exposed to pesticides via contaminated water and sediment, leading to several potential cascading effects on the food web. The aim of this study was to assess the functional implications of environmental realistic concentrations of the herbicide 2,4-D and the insecticide fipronil (alone and in combination) to the native tropical chironomid Chironomus sancticaroli. These two pesticides are widely applied to different crops and have frequently been detected (together) in surface water bodies in Brazil and elsewhere. Commercial products containing fipronil (Regent (R) 800WG) and 2,4-D (DMA (R) 806BR) were evaluated in 8-day toxicity tests for their effects on larval survival, growth (body length and biomass), head capsule width, development, and mentum deformities. Fipronil decreased the larval survival at the highest test concentration and the effective concentrations (EC) after eight days of exposure were: EC10 = 0.48 mu g L-1 (0.395-0.565), EC20 = 1.06 mu g L-1 (0.607-1.513), and EC50 = 3.70 mu g L-1 (1.664-5.736). All sublethal test concentrations of fipronil decreased the larval growth, causing reductions in biomass up to 72%. The two highest test concentrations of fipronil decreased the head capsule width and after exposure to 3.7 mu g fipronil L-1, only half of the larvae reached the fourth instar. The incidence of deformities was increased by fipronil in a concentration dependent manner with an increase ranging from 23% to 75%. The highest test concentration of 2.4-D (426 mu g L-1) decreased the head capsule width, but larval development was unaffected at all concentrations evaluated. In the mixture tests, antagonism was observed at lower fipronil concentrations and synergism at higher fipronil concentrations for growth. The incidence of deformities rose with increasing fipronil concentrations. The results showed that environmental realistic concentrations of fipronil may have serious ecological implications for C. sancticaroli populations and that a mixture with the herbicide 2,4-D can have synergistic effects, potentiating the risks to the aquatic ecosystem."

Median lethal dose (LD50) of the IMI-based formulation tested was 57.11 mg IMI/kg body weight (bw), with intoxication signs starting from 20.6 mg IMI/kg bw. The feed intake rale (FIR) was estimated experimentally as 4.895 g/day per bird, representing 12.43% of bw. It was calculated that the ingestion of 7-10% of the FIR as treated seeds would be enough to achieve the LD50 for sorghum, corn, sunflower, and alfalfa, whereas consumption of 31 and 54% of FIR was necessary for oat and wheat, respectively. Based on spill data values available in the literature, it was calculated that, for most crops, a baywing would have to forage an area of field corresponding to less than 60 m(2) to obtain the number of seeds required to reach the LD50. It was also shown that this number of seeds is coherent with the amount of seeds ingested in a bout. In a pilot study, all grayish baywings fed with millet seeds treated with 3 g IMI/kg died within three to five days of exposure. In Tier I risk assessment, the trigger value was achieved for all crops except soybean and a weight-of-evidence risk assessment was performed. All lines of evidence examined are consistent with the view that grayish baywings, and probably other small farmland birds, are exposed to a risk of acute toxicity and mortality under both worst-case and mixed-ration exposure scenarios. The possible impacts on bird species calls for an urgent reconsideration of IMI seed coating practices currently approved in the Pampa Region of Argentina and the various parts of the world where this practice is still in use.

Glyphosate is polar and water soluble and therefore does not bioaccumulate, biomagnify, or accumulate to high levels in the environment. It sorbs strongly to particles in soil and sediments and this reduces bioavailability so that exposures to non-target organisms in the environment are acute and decrease with half-lives in the order of hours to a few days. The target site for glyphosate is not known to be expressed in animals, which reduces the probability of toxicity and small risks. Technical glyphosate (acid or salts) is of low to moderate toxicity; however, when mixed with some formulants such as polyoxyethylene amines (POEAs), toxicity to aquatic animals increases about 15-fold on average. However, glyphosate and the formulants have different fates in the environment and they do not necessarily co-occur. Therefore, toxicity tests on formulated products in scenarios where they would not be used are unrealistic and of limited use for assessment of risk. Concentrations of glyphosate in surface water are generally low with minimal risk to aquatic organisms, including plants. Toxicity and risks to non-target terrestrial organisms other than plants treated directly are low and risks to terrestrial invertebrates and microbial processes in soil are very small. Formulations containing POEAs are not labeled for use over water but, because POEA rapidly partitions into sediment, risks to aquatic organisms from accidental over-sprays are reduced in shallow water bodies. We conclude that use of formulations of glyphosate under good agricultural practices presents a de minimis risk of direct and indirect adverse effects in non-target organisms."

Accordingly, recommendations to reduce pesticide risk through a combination of reforms at the policy level and its tools, particularly legislation, are proposed. In our opinion, the starting point is to adopt a minimum list of lower risk pesticides supported by a combination of: prescriptions based on a comprehensive registration and an effective implementation systems, a suitable IPM/ICM government-supported credit system, traceability systems of agricultural commodities and pesticides containers, Pesticide stock management system to reduce the quantity of obsolete pesticides, and containers recycling system. For a global sustainability of pesticides risk reduction, a binding global intervention fostered by the UN, based on human rights for safe food, is called upon to ban hazardous pesticides-except those of WHO class IV- trafficking in developing countries scoring low in an international official assessment of their pesticides lifecycle management. At the same time, global funds should support pesticides alternatives and the enhancement of the developing countries capacities for pesticides lifecycle management, which is a part of a larger global matrix in risk reduction."

Understanding the interactions between nanopesticides and edible plants, as well as non-target animals, is crucial in assessing the potential impact of nanotechnology products on the environment, agriculture and human health. The dramatic increase in efforts to use nanopesticides renders the risk assessment of their toxicity and genotoxicity highly crucial due to the potential adverse impact of this relatively uncharted territory. Such widespread use naturally increases our exposure to nanopesticides, raising concerns over their possible adverse effects on humans and non-target organisms, which might include severe impairment of both male and female reproductive capacity. We therefore need better insight into such effects to derive conclusive evidence on the safety or toxicity/genotoxicity of nanopesticides, andDrosophila melanogaster(fruit fly) can prove an ideal model organism for the risk assessment and toxicological classification of nanopesticides, as it bears striking similarities to various systems in human body.

Yet, other pertinent factors, such as the effects of glyphosate on fresh and ground water and ensuing effects on biodiversity, have received less attention as legitimate rationales for regulating the chemical. This underrepresentation prevents a wider policy discussion on the environmental and human health effects of the chemical and fails to disrupt assumptions of path-dependently continuing on agriculture's chemical treadmill. To avoid ad hoc post hoc chemical regulation, we assess four areas of chemical regulatory oversight in Europe with regard to glyphosate affecting water: (1) the undue emphasis on in laboratorio versus in situ testing; (2) assessing single chemicals (isolated glyphosate) versus admixtures (glyphosate plus surfactants and adjuvants) that are used in practice; (3) the tendency to downplay harms to non-human life; and (4) the lack of policy coherence in the existing regulatory framework.

Even though its use is rapidly growing, it is not followed by an adequate flow of scientific evidence regarding its toxicity towards non-target organisms. We evaluated the potential of low doses of tembotrione to induce oxidative stress and cytogenetic damage in blood and brain cells of adult male Wistar rats. Parameters of lipid peroxidation, glutathione levels, activities of antioxidant enzymes and primary DNA damage were assessed following 28-day repeated oral exposure to doses comparable with the currently proposed health-based reference values. The results of the alkaline comet assay showed that such low doses of tembotrione have the potency to inflict primary DNA damage in both peripheral blood leukocytes and brain of treated rats, even with only slight changes in the oxidative biomarker levels. The DNA damage in blood and brain cells of Wistar rats significantly increased at all applied doses, suggesting that tembotrione genotoxicity is mainly a result of direct interaction with DNA while the induction of oxidative stress responses contributes to DNA instability in a lesser extent.

The commercial success of this molecule is due to its nonselectivity and its action, which would supposedly target specific biosynthetic pathways found mainly in plants. Multiple studies have however provided evidence for high sensitivity of many nontarget species to glyphosate and/or to formulations (glyphosate mixed with surfactants). This herbicide, found at significant levels in aquatic systems through surface runoffs, impacts life history traits and immune parameters of several aquatic invertebrates' species, including disease-vector mosquitoes. Mosquitoes, from hatching to emergence, are exposed to aquatic chemical contaminants. In this study, we first compared the toxicity of pure glyphosate to the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations for the main vector of avian malaria in Europe, Culex pipiens mosquito. Then we evaluated, for the first time, how field-realistic dose of glyphosate interacts with larval nutritional stress to alter mosquito life history traits and susceptibility to avian malaria parasite infection. Our results show that exposure of larvae to field-realistic doses of glyphosate, pure or in formulation, did not affect larval survival rate, adult size, and female fecundity. One of our two experimental blocks showed, however, that exposure to glyphosate decreased development time and reduced mosquito infection probability by malaria parasite. Interestingly, the effect on malaria infection was lost when the larvae were also subjected to a nutritional stress, probably due to a lower ingestion of glyphosate."
