Among a variety of herbicides, paraquat (PQ), frequently used as an effective herbicidal agent worldwide, is well-known for its serious toxicity that has killed, and harmed, thousands of people and countless wildlife such as fish. Herein, we present a facile supramolecular formulation of PQ@cucurbit[7]uril (PQ@CB[7]), prepared by simply mixing PQ with equivalent (molar) CB[7] in water. With addition of CB[7], PQ's cellular uptake was dramatically inhibited. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the associated apoptosis otherwise induced by PQ in cellular models were both reduced, resulting in increased cellular viability. In a wildtype zebrafish model that is a typical fragile wildlife species in the ecosystem, the supramolecular formulation exhibited significantly reduced hepatotoxicity and increased survival rate, in comparison with those of the fish exposed to free PQ. In a mouse model that is clinically relevant to human being, the administration of PQ@CB[7] significantly alleviated major organ injuries and unusual hematological parameters that were otherwise induced by free PQ, resulting in a significantly increased survival rate. Meanwhile, this formulation maintained effective herbicidal activity that was equivalent to that of free PQ. Taken together, this facile supramolecular PQ formulation is providing not only an extremely rare example of an eco- and user-friendly herbicide that has been desired for decades but also a practical solution for green agriculture.",2019,67,7783,7792,10.1021/acs.jafc.9b00764

Especially mixture toxicity assessments appear to be scarce. To contribute to increase our knowledge in this arena, we evaluated the acute toxicity of diuron and carbofuran and their mixtures to the neotropical oligochaetes Allonais inaequalis and Dero furcatus, and the ostracod Strandesia trispinosa. Tests were performed with both the pure active ingredients, as well as their formulated products. The toxicity of the latter to the three test organisms was generally greater than that of the pure active ingredients, although absolute differences were rather small. The sensitivity of the indigenous species was slightly greater than temperate test species from the same taxonomic groups. The concentration addition conceptual model best described the results of the mixture toxicity data. Derived deviations of this model appeared to be dependent on the test organism and as to whether the pesticides were applied as active ingredients or their commercial products. Reported field concentrations of the two pesticides indicate risks to freshwater biota, especially if they are both present. The test species used in the present study are concluded to be suitable candidates as surrogate test organisms in local pesticide risk evaluations.",2018,27,834,844,10.1007/s10646-018-1921-9

The mechanisms of action related to its exposure, relevant both in animals and humans, are still insufficiently investigated. This comprehensive study focused on the outcomes of terbuthylazine exposure at cell level in vitro, and a mice model in vivo. Experiments in vitro were conducted on whole human peripheral blood, isolated lymphocytes, and HepG2 cells exposed for 4 h to terbuthylazine at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current reference values set by the European Commission in 2011. Terbuthylazine cytotoxicity was evaluated using dual fluorescent staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange on lymphocytes, and CCK-8 colorimetric assay on HepG2 cells. The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified comet assays. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of oxidative stress in vitro was studied using a battery of standard oxidative stress biomarkers. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino mice exposed to terbuthlyazine in the form of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days. Following exposure, the DNA damage levels in leukocytes, bone marrow, liver, and kidney cells of the treated mice were measured using an alkaline comet assay. In vitro results suggested low terbuthylazine cytotoxicity in non-target cells. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced lymphocyte viability by 15%, mostly due to apoptosis, while cytotoxic effects in HepG2 cells at the same concentration were negligible. Acute in vitro exposure of human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells to terbuthylazine resulted in low-level DNA instability, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the DNA damage obtained using the hOGG1-modified comet assay indicated that oxidative DNA damage did not prevail in the overall damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of oxidative stress markers, which were mostly comparable to control. Results obtained in mice indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of terbuthylazine produced DNA instability in all of the studied cell types. We found that DNA in liver and kidney cells was more prone to direct toxic effects of the parent compound and its metabolites than DNA in leukocytes and bone marrow cells. The overall findings suggest the formation of reactive terbuthylazine metabolites capable of inducing DNA cross-links, which hinder DNA migration. These effects were most pronounced in liver cells in vivo and HepG2 cells in vitro. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional research is needed. Nevertheless, the present study provides evidence that terbuthylazine at concentrations comparable with current reference values possesses toxicological risk because it caused low-level DNA instability, both at cellular and animal organism level, which should be further established in forthcoming studies.",2018,25,19065,19081,10.1007/s11356-018-2046-7

The massive and increasing use of GBHs results in not only the global burden of occupational exposures, but also increased exposure to the general population. The current pilot study represents the first phase of a long-term investigation of GBHs that we are conducting over the next 5 years. In this paper, we present the study design, the first evaluation of in vivo parameters and the determination of glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in urine. Methods: We exposed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats orally via drinking water to a dose of glyphosate equivalent to the United States Acceptable Daily Intake (US ADI) of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, defined as the chronic Reference Dose (cRfD) determined by the US EPA, starting from prenatal life, i.e. gestational day (GD) 6 of their mothers. One cohort was continuously dosed until sexual maturity (6-week cohort) and another cohort was continuously dosed until adulthood (13-week cohort). Here we present data on general toxicity and urinary concentrations of glyphosate and its major metabolite AMPA. Results: Survival, body weight, food and water consumption of the animals were not affected by the treatment with either glyphosate or Roundup. The concentration of both glyphosate and AMPA detected in the urine of SD rats treated with glyphosate were comparable to that observed in animals treated with Roundup, with an increase in relation to the duration of treatment. The majority of glyphosate was excreted unchanged. Urinary levels of the parent compound, glyphosate, were around 100-fold higher than the level of its metabolite, AMPA. Conclusions: Glyphosate concentrations in urine showed that most part of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged parent compound upon glyphosate and Roundup exposure, with an increasing pattern of glyphosate excreted in urine in relation to the duration of treatment The adjuvants and the other substances present in Roundup did not seem to exert a major effect on the absorption and excretion of glyphosate. Our results demonstrate that urinary glyphosate is a more relevant marker of exposure than AMPA in the rodent model.",2018,17,NA,NA,10.1186/s12940-018-0393-y

The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis (Shikimate pathway), which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate, is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species. Several in vitro studies have shown that various groups of intestinal bacteria may be differently affected by glyphosate. Here, we present results from an animal exposure trial combining deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial community with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolic profiling of aromatic amino acids and their downstream metabolites. We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova (R) 450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial. The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment. A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria. We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Regardless of acute poisonings which are common for some classes of pesticides like organophosphoruses, the association of chronic and sub-lethal exposure to pesticides with a prevalence of some persistent diseases is going to be a phenomenon to which global attention has been attracted. In this review, incidence of various malignant, neurodegenerative, respiratory, reproductive, developmental, and metabolic diseases in relation to different routes of human exposure to pesticides such as occupational, environmental, residential, parental, maternal, and paternal has been systematically criticized in different categories of pesticide toxicities like carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and metabolic toxicity. A huge body of evidence exists on the possible role of pesticide exposures in the elevated incidence of human diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, asthma, bronchitis, infertility, birth defects, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, diabetes, and obesity. Most of the disorders are induced by insecticides and herbicides most notably organophosphorus, organochlorines, phenoxyacetic acids, and triazine compounds.",2017,91,549,599,10.1007/s00204-016-1849-x

Identifying novel active ingredients and improving the delivery system of a pesticide are the main challenges in developing new pesticides. Strategies for the control of delivery systems for slow and sustained release of agrochemicals are of great interest to environmental scientists. In this context, the selection of materials to be used as carrier agents in pesticide formulations is crucial. In recent years, the efficacy of several materials for agrochemical formulations has been evaluated by researchers. These materials have unique properties, such as being biodegradable and biocompatible, and having low toxicity and involving a simple preparation process. This review summarises recent applications of various materials in pesticide formulations. The application of the materials can effectively encapsulate or bind the pesticide's active ingredients in the material's matrix with a sustained release profile and slow mobility in soil. This review also discusses some issues and concerns that are faced in formulating pesticide products.",2016,13,2977,2994,10.1007/s13762-016-1096-y

The lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata is an important beneficial insect in cropland that is commonly used as an indicator species in safety evaluations of pesticides. Here, we examined the lethal and non-lethal effects of 2,4-D and dicamba active ingredients and commercial formulations to this lady beetle species, and tested for synergistic effects of the herbicides. Second instars of lady beetles were exposed to an experimental treatment, and their mortality, development, weight, sex ratio, fecundity, and mobility was evaluated. Using similar methods, a dose-response study was conducted on 2,4-D with and without dicamba. The commercial formulation of 2,4-D was highly lethal to lady beetle larvae; the LC90 of this herbicide was 13 % of the label rate. In this case, the inactive ingredients were a key driver of the toxicity. Dicamba active ingredient significantly increased lady beetle mortality and reduced their body weight. The commercial formulations of both herbicides reduced the proportion of males in the lady beetle population. The herbicides when used together did not act synergistically in their toxicity toward lady beetles versus when the chemistries were used independently. Our work shows that herbicide formulations can cause both lethal and sublethal effects on non-target, beneficial insects, and these effects are sometimes driven by the inactive ingredients. The field-level implications of shifts in weed management practices on insect management programs should receive further attention.",2016,25,1270,1277,10.1007/s10646-016-1680-4

We tested the endocrine disruption of co-formulants in six glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), the most used pesticides worldwide. All co-formulants and formulations were comparably cytotoxic well below the agricultural dilution of 1% (18-2000 times for co-formulants, 8-141 times for formulations), and not the declared active ingredient glyphosate (G) alone. The endocrine-disrupting effects of all these compounds were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme in the balance of sex hormones, below the toxicity threshold. Aromatase activity was decreased both by the co-formulants alone (polyethoxylated tallow amine-POEA and alkyl polyglucoside-APG) and by the formulations, from concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1/3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated for the first time that endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to co-formulants. These results could explain numerous in vivo results with GBHs not seen with G alone; moreover, they challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for GBHs exposures, currently calculated from toxicity tests of the declared active ingredient alone.",2016,13,NA,NA,10.3390/ijerph13030264

Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan (http://rayyan.qcri.org), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. Results: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The taster review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The suggestions and hints,based on the prediction model,appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34% of the respondents reporting more than 50% time savings. In addition, around 75% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users.

For this the acute and chronic cumulative exposure to triazole pesticides was estimated using national food consumption and Monitoring data of eight European countries. Both the acute and chronic cumulative dietary exposures were calculated according to two model runs (optimistic and pessimistic) as recommended in the EFSA guidance. The exposures obtained with these model runs differed substantially for all countries, with the highest exposures obtained with the pessimistic model run. In this model run, animal commodities including cattle milk and different meat types, entered in the exposure calculations at the level of the maximum residue limit (MRL), contributed most to the exposure. We conclude that application of the optimistic model run on a routine basis for cumulative assessments is feasible. The pessimistic model run is laborious and the exposure results could be too far from reality. More experience with this approach is needed to stimulate the discussion of the feasibility of all the requirements, especially the inclusion of MRLs of animal commodities which seem to result in unrealistic conclusions regarding their contribution to the dietary exposure.

The co-incubation with Tween 80 and PEG6000 powerfully counteracted the cytotoxicity of avermectin. Tween 80 enhanced, whereas PEG6000 compressed, the cytotoxicity of chlorfluazuron on Tn5B1-4 cells, and also improved a bit of the cytotoxidty of chlorpyrifos or tebufenozide on HepG2 cells.

However, the aqueous solubility and soil sorption of this compound can cause problems of toxicity in nontarget organisms. This work investigates the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles composed of chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) to produce an efficient herbicidal formulation that was less toxic and could be used for safer control of weeds in agriculture. The toxicities of the formulations were evaluated using cell culture viability assays and the Allium cepa chromosome aberration test. The herbicidal activity was investigated in cultivations of maize (Zea mays) and mustard (Brassica sp.), and soil sorption of the nanoencapsulated herbicide was measured. The efficiency association of paraquat with the nanoparticles was 62.6 +/- 0.7%. Encapsulation of the herbicide resulted in changes in its diffusion and release as well as its sorption by soil. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that the nanoencapsulated herbicide was less toxic than the pure compound, indicating its potential to control weeds while at the same time reducing environmental impacts. Measurements of herbicidal activity showed that the effectiveness of paraquat was preserved after encapsulation. It was concluded that the encapsulation of paraquat in nanoparticles can provide a useful means of reducing adverse impacts on human health and the environment, and that the formulation therefore has potential for use in agriculture.

However, the knowledge on the genotoxicity of pesticides to fish is still limited. Moreover, genotoxic studies have been almost exclusively focused on the active ingredients, whereas the effect of adjuvants is frequently ignored. Hence, the present study addressed the herbicide Roundup(A (R)), evaluating the relative contribution of the active ingredient (glyphosate) and the surfactant (polyethoxylated amine; POEA) to the genotoxicity of the commercial formulation on Anguilla anguilla. Fish were exposed to equivalent concentrations of Roundup(A (R)) (58, 116 mu g L-1), glyphosate (17.9, 35.7 mu g L-1) and POEA (9.3, 18.6 mu g L-1), during 1 and 3 days. The comet assay was applied to blood cells, either as the standard procedure, or with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes in an attempt to clarify DNA damaging mechanisms. The results confirmed the genotoxicity of Roundup(A (R)), also demonstrating the genotoxic potential of glyphosate and POEA individually. Though both components contributed to the overall genotoxicity of the pesticide formulation, the sum of their individual effects was never observed, pointing out an antagonistic interaction. Although POEA is far from being considered biologically inert, it did not increase the risk associated to glyphosate when the two were combined. The analysis of oxidatively induced breaks suggested that oxidation of DNA bases was not a dominant mechanism of damage. The present findings highlighted the risk posed to fish populations by the assessed chemicals, jointly or individually, emphasizing the need to define regulatory thresholds for all the formulation components and recommending, in particular, the revision of the hazard classification of POEA.",2012,21,1381,1390,10.1007/s10646-012-0892-5

Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: i) control (C), ii) AS at 500 ng L-1 (P500), iii) AS at 800 ng L-1 (P800) and iv) Prowl 400 (R) at 500 ng L-1 (Pw). After a 28 day exposure period (D28), 10 fish were sampled for each condition and 10 other after a 15 day recovery period in clean fresh water (043). Pendimethalin concentrations in the exposure water and muscles were followed. White blood cell counts, differential leucocyte counts, cell mortality and phagocytosis activity were measured. Haemolytic alternative complement activity, lysozyme concentration and stress parameters were analyzed. The resulting concentration of pendimethalin in the exposure water was lower than the expected concentration. At D28, the concentration quantified in the contaminated fish was negligible in comparison with the Reference Dose for Oral Exposure estimated by US-EPA's Integrated Risk Information System. Leucopenia was noted in all contaminated fish. A decrease in phagocytosis activity and ACH(50) was also observed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Disturbed lysozyme activity was noted only in fish exposed to Pw. Furthermore, during exposure to a similar concentration of pendimethalin, the commercial product seemed to be more immunotoxic than the AS alone. Finally, at D43, the effects proved reversible for sanitary status while immunity was still disturbed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The tool aims to increase transparency and to harmonise approaches of reliability assessment. The tool consists of two parts, one to evaluate in vivo and one to evaluate in vitro data. The prototypes of the tool were tested in two independent inter-rater experiments.

nagyrefs25,Guy,NO,"Cox, C; Surgan, M",Unidentified inert ingredients in pesticides: Implications for human and environmental health,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,"BACKGROUND: By statute or regulation in the United States and elsewhere, pesticide ingredients are divided into two categories: active and inert (sometimes referred to as other ingredients, adjuvants, or coformulants). Despite their name, inert ingredients may be biologically or chemically active and are labeled inert only because of their function in the formulated product. Most of the tests required to register a pesticide are performed with the active ingredient alone, not the fall pesticide formulation. Inert ingredients are generally not identified on product labels and are often claimed to be confidential business information. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we describe the shortcomings of the current procedures for assessing the hazards of pesticide formulations and demonstrate that inert ingredients can increase the toxicity of and potential exposure to pesticide formulations. DISCUSSION: Inert ingredients can increase the ability of pesticide formulations to affect significant toxicologic end points, including developmental neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and disruption of hormone function. They can also increase exposure by increasing dermal absorption, decreasing the efficacy of protective clothing, and increasing environmental mobility and persistence. Inert ingredients can increase the phytotoxicity of pesticide formulations as well as the toxicity to Fish, amphibians, and microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Pesticide registration should require fall assessment of formulations. Evaluations of pesticides under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and similar statutes should include impact assessment of formulations. Environmental monitoring for pesticides should include inert ingredients. To enable independent research and risk assessment, inert ingredients should be identified on product labels.",2006,114,1803,1806,10.1289/ehp.9374

When applied, it is not used as a pure active ingredient but in the form of commercial formulations. Besides atrazine, these formulations contain other substances that might represent a risk to human health due to their mutual interactions. We evaluated the genotoxicity, apoptosis and necrosis induction of atrazine as an active ingredient, the commercial formulation Gesaprim (R), and a Gesaprim (R) adjuvant mixture without atrazine by comet and DNA diffusion assay, respectively. Human lymphocytes were treated for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 It with 0.047 mu g/ml, 0.47 mu g/ml, 4.7 mu g/ml of substances tested both in the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activator. Atrazine did not appear to be genotoxic or to be capable of inducing apoptosis or necrosis. Unlike atrazine, Gesaprime (R) and the adjuvant mixture increased DNA damage in lymphocytes. After 5 h of treatment, it also increased the number of apoptotic cells. Metabolic activation additionally enhanced the DNA-damaging potential of Gesaprim (R) and the adjuvant mixture but did not affect atrazine genotoxicity. Thus, both assay endpoints differed significantly for the active ingredient and formulation. To evaluate the potential health risk of simultaneous exposure to adjuvants and an active ingredient, further efforts using a biomonitoring approach should be made. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Pesticides are among a number of proposed causes for these declines. Although a sizable database examining effects of pesticides on amphibians exists, the vast majority of these studies focus on toxicological effects (lethality, external malformations, etc.) at relatively high doses (parts per million). Very few studies focus on effects such as endocrine disruption at low concentrations. Further, most studies examine exposures to single chemicals only. The present study examined nine pesticides (four herbicides, two fungicides, and three insecticides) used on cornfields in the midwestern United States. Effects of each pesticide alone (0.1 ppb) or in combination were examined. In addition, we also examined atrazine and S-metolachlor combined (0.1 or 10 ppb each) and the commercial formulation Bicep II Magnum, which contains both of these herbicides. These two pesticides were examined in combination because they are persistent throughout the year in the wild. We examined larval growth and development, sex differentiation, and immune function in leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). In a follow-up study, we also examined the effects of the nine-compound mixture on plasma corticosterone levels in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Although some of the pesticides individually inhibited larval growth and development, the pesticide mixtures had much greater effects. Larval growth and development were retarded, but most significantly, pesticide mixtures negated or reversed the typically positive correlation between time to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis observed in controls: exposed larvae that took longer to metamorphose were smaller than their counterparts that metamorphosed earlier. The nine-pesticide mixture also induced damage to the thymus, resulting in immunosuppression and contraction of flavobacterial meningitis. The study in X laevis revealed that these adverse effects may be due to an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. Although it cannot be determined whether all the pesticides in the mixture contribute to these adverse effects or whether some pesticides are effectors, some are enhancers, and some are neutral, the present study revealed that estimating ecological risk and the impact of pesticides on amphibians using studies that examine only single pesticides at high concentrations may lead to gross underestimations of the role of pesticides in amphibian declines.",2006,114,40,50,10.1289/ehp.8051

Roundup stimulates succinate-supported respiration twice, with simultaneous collapse of transmembrane electrical potential, while glyphosate used in the same concentrations does not induce any significant effect. Additionally, Roundup depresses state 3 respiration by about 40%, at 15 mM, whereas uncoupled respiration in the presence of FCCP is depressed by about 50%. Depression of uncoupled respiratory activity is mediated through partial inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II and III, but not of complex IV. The phosphorylative system was affected by both a direct and an indirect effect on the F0F1 ATPase activity. The addition of uncoupled concentrations of Roundup to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria treated with Ruthenium Red resulted in non-specific membrane permeabilization, as evidenced by mitochondrial swelling in isosmotic sucrose medium. Therefore, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also related to the non-specific membrane permeabilization induced by Roundup. Glyphosate alone does not show any relevant effect on the mitochondrial bioenergetics, in opposition to Roundup formulation products. The differences in the toxicity observed could be either attributed to some products of Roundup or to a synergic effect of glyphosate and formulation products. Bearing in mind that mitochondria is provided with a variety of bioenergetic functions mandatory for the regulation of intracellular aerobic energy production and electrolyte homeostasis, these results question the safety of Roundup on animal health.

Here we show that glyphosate is toxic to human placental JEG3 cells within 18 hr with concentrations lower than those found with agricultural use, and this effect increases with concentration and time or in the presence of Roundup adjuvants. Surprisingly, Roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredient. We tested the effects of glyphosate and Roundup at lower nontoxic concentrations on aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis. The glyphosate-based herbicide disrupts aromatase activity and mRNA levels and interacts with the active site of the purified enzyme, but the effects of glyphosate are facilitated by the Roundup formulation in microsomes or in cell culture.

Concentrations of 0.1-25.0 mug/ml of zineb or azzurro, induced a significant dose-dependent increase in SCE frequency over control values. For both test compounds, while doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mug/ml did not alter the rate of cell proliferation, a significant delay in cell-cycle progression was observed within the 5.0-25.0 mug/ml dose-range. A regression test showed that either the proliferative replication index or the mitotic activity of cultures decreased as a function of the pesticide concentration within the 1.0-25.0 mug/ml dose-range. Doses higher than 50.0 mug/ml were cytotoxic. SCGE assay revealed an increase in zineb-induced DNA damage by enhancing the proportion of slightly damaged cells in the 25.0-100.0 mug/ml dose-range and by increasing in a dose-dependent manner the proportion of damaged cells within the 1.0-100.0 mug/ml dose-range.

Data on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of deltamethrin are rather controversial, depending on the genetic system or the assay used. The aim of the present study was to analyze previously demonstrated metabolic changes using aspecific noninvasive methods in rats which art: potentially applicable for monitoring occupational exposure. Since human exposure to pesticides occurs not only to active principles but to ail chemicals present in a commercial formulation, we tested both the pure compound and a deltamethrin-based commercial formulation. Groups of rats were treated, i.p., consecutively for 7 days. The daily doses tested were 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight for pure deltamethrin, corresponding to volumes of 178.57 and 377.14 mu l/kg body weight for the commercial formulation (containing 2.8% deltamethrin). Urine was analyzed for mutagenic metabolites, thioethers, and D-glucaric acid content. Faeces extracts were tested for mutagenicity. Results show that DGA urinary excretion values did not mirror the phase I enzyme induction capability of the insecticide. Results obtained for urinary thioethers do not agree completely with those obtained on the influence of deltamethrin on glutathione S-transferase activity in rat liver. In fact, after administration of the deltamethrin commercial formulation, highest thioether excretion values were obtained during the treatment time for treated animals, as compared to controls. The mean values (+/-SEM) of thioether excretion were 0.033 +/- 0.002 mu mole -SH/24 h for control animals, 0.122 +/- 0.004 and 0.185 +/- 0.025 for the two treatment groups. Thence, thioether determination in urine samples seems to be a suitable aspecific noninvasive method for assessing exposure to deltamethrin-based formulations, particularly those containing xylene and mesitylene as solvents, as in the tested formulation. Negative or toxic results obtained in the urinary and faecal mutagenicity test seem to exclude the formation and excretion of mutagenic metabolites following treatment with deltamethrin.",1997,33,323,328,10.1007/s002449900260

Definitions are proposed for reliability, relevance, and adequancy of data. Reliability is differentiated into four categories. Criteria relating to international testing standards for categorizing reliability are developed. A systematic documentation of evaluating reliability especially for use in the IUCLID database is proposed. This approach is intended to harmonize data evaluation processes worldwide. It may help the expert in subsequent assessments and should increase the clarity of evaluation. (C) 1997 Academic Press.",1997,25,1,5,10.1006/rtph.1996.1076

Mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood were exposed to analytical alachlor, alachlor conjugated to human serum albumin or Lasso formulation over a concentration range from .01 uM-1.0 uM. The effects of the test materials on the following immunological functions were determined: lymphocyte proliferation induced by mitogen or antigen; antibody synthesis of IgG and IgM isotypes in pokeweed stimulated monouclear cell cultures; cytotoxic T cell proliferation; lysis of target cells by natural killer cells and lymphokine activated killer cells. The data demonstrated that the test compounds had no significant, dose related effect on the function of immunocompetent cells. Hence, the data suggest that the components of the Lasso formulation have no effect on the human immune system.",1992,14,955,979,10.3109/08923979209009244
