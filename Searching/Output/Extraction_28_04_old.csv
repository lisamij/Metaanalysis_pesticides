Ferguson S.; Mesnage R.; Antoniou M.N.,Cytotoxicity Mechanisms of Eight Major Herbicide Active Ingredients in Comparison to Their Commercial Formulations,2022,Toxics,10,NA,NA,10.3390/toxics10110711,"Commercial pesticide formulations contain co-formulants, which are generally considered as having no toxic effects in mammals. This study aims to compare the toxicity of 8 major herbicide active ingredients–namely glyphosate, dicamba, 2,4-D, fluroxypyr, quizalofop-p-ethyl, pendimethalin, propyzamide and metazachlor–with a typical commercial formulation of each active ingredient. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress capability was assessed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Using an MTT assay, formulations of glyphosate (Roundup Probio), fluroxypyr (Hurler), quizalofop-p-ethyl (Targa Super) and dicamba (Hunter) were more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Metazachlor and its formulation Sultan had similar cytotoxicity profiles. Cytotoxicity profiles were comparable in immortalised human fibroblasts. Toxilight necrosis assays showed the formulation of metazachlor (Sultan50C) resulted in significant membrane disruption compared to the active ingredient. Generation of reactive oxygen species was detected for glyphosate, fluroxypyr, pendimethalin, quizalofop-p-ethyl, the formulation of 2,4-D (Anti-Liserons), and dicamba and its formulation Hunter. Further testing of quizalofop-p-ethyl and its formulation Targa Super in the ToxTracker assay system revealed that both products induced oxidative stress and an unfolded protein response. In conclusion, these results show that most herbicide formulations tested in this study are more toxic than their active ingredients in human tissue culture cell model systems. The results add to a growing body of evidence, which implies that commercial herbicide formulations and not just their active ingredients should be evaluated in regulatory risk assessment of pesticides. © 2022 by the authors.",NA

We assessed changes in malaria incidence over an additional 21 months, corresponding to a change in IRS formulations using clothianidin with and without deltamethrin. Using enhanced health facility surveillance data, our objectives were to 1) estimate the impact of IRS on monthly malaria case counts at five surveillance sites over a 6.75 year period, and 2) compare monthly case counts at five facilities receiving IRS to ten facilities in neighboring districts not receiving IRS. For both objectives, we specified mixed effects negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for surveillance site adjusting for rainfall, season, care-seeking, and malaria diagnostic. Following the implementation of IRS, cases were 84% lower in years 4–5 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 0.16, 95% CI 0.12–0.22), 43% lower in year 6 (aIRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.44–0.74), and 39% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.97–1.97) compared to pre-IRS levels. Cases were 67% lower in IRS sites than non-IRS sites in year 6 (aIRR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.17–0.63) but 38% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.90–2.11). We observed a resurgence in malaria to pre-IRS levels despite sustained IRS. The timing of this resurgence corresponded to a change of active ingredient. Further research is needed to determine causality. © 2022 Epstein et al.",NA
Suder D.; Socha M.,Roundup in the aquatic environment and fish reproduction,2022,Animal Science and Genetics,18,1,10,10.5604/01.3001.0015.9691,"This review paper aims to present the effects of Roundup in the aquatic environment on fish reproduction. It describes the mechanism of action and toxic effects of Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on non-target organisms — flatworms, amphibians, and mammals. Commercial formulations based on glyphosate are dangerous for living organisms, as they lead to behavioural disorders, reduce reproductive parameters, and may cause metabolic disorders. In fish, Roundup causes damage to the liver, brain, and gills, and triggers degenerative changes in the kidneys. Sub-lethal doses of this pesticide impair locomotor activity and damage DNA through oxidative stress. Many experiments show toxic effects of Roundup on fish reproduction. Reported anomalies include disturbances in embryogenesis (e.g. pericardial oedema or tail bend), reduced embryo survival, and an increase in the number of deformed larvae. Roundup and glyphosate inhibit ovarian follicular growth in adult females. Adult males exposed to the pesticide have inferior semen quality, with limited sperm concentration and motility. Roundup represents a serious threat to land and water organisms, and therefore its use must be limited. © 2022, Polish Society of Animal Production. All rights reserved.",NA

Some biomarkers can help assess the health status, indicating physical, metabolic, and behavioral changes under acute and sublethal poisoning. The mixture of the active ingredients cyproconazole and pico-xystrobin is a widely used fungicide for the control of pests in cotton, rice, coffee, sugarcane, corn, soybean, and wheat. The objective of this study was to verify the occurrence of possible histopathological lesions in the liver and kidneys of bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) caused by a fungicide commercial formula composed of picoxystrobin and cyproconazole. The animals were subjected to different concentrations of the fungicide to determine the median lethal concentration (LC50-96h = 0.05 mg L-1), that is, the lethal dose for 50% of the animals in 96 h. After determining the value of LC50-96h, the animals were subjected to three sublethal concentrations (LC50-96h/2, LC50-96h/10, and LC-). Through histological biomarkers, it was verified that this fungicide changed the morphology 50-96h/100 of the animals’ kidney and liver tissues in a chronic way, impairing the functioning of organs that are essential for their survival and metamorphosis, which can result in an imbalance in the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. © 2022, Instytut Technologii Drewna.

Although the benefits of this technology in terms of safety, efficiency, sustainability, and performance in the field are undeniable, a huge regulatory issue remains to be overcome. Apart from the several promises and challenges in the development, scale up, and use of the nanoformulations in the field, the global market shows a stable growth of this technology and a movement toward innovation by using sustainable components and new application models. All the known nanosystems’ advantages are thoroughly explained by the physicochemistry of colloids. This technology might provide more stable formulations in terms of shelf-life, a higher field performance with a lower applied dose of the AI, and less issues in the tank mixtures. Indeed, a rising technology in precision agriculture is the application of nanoformulations through drones, which can finally overspread their use in the field. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the global market for nanofertilizers, besides deepening on the main physicochemical properties linked to the higher stability of nanoformulations over conventional ones, as well as their expected performance in the tank mix applications in the field. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",NA

Nearly one-third of crops are affected in conventional farming due to pathogens infestation. Nanotechnology can change agricultural production and improve plant growth by facilitating the cost-effective management of natural resources and other necessary inputs. Nanomaterials (NMs) in agriculture offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve crop yield and preserve soil health. Potential NMs uptake in soil-plant systems and positive and negative effects in various crops have been observed in several studies. Because of their unique properties, NMs have received much attention in agriculture. NMs and nanotechnology improve the stability and dispersion of active ingredients, reduce residual pollution and labor costs, and maintain agricultural systems’ sustainability. Many nanomaterials-based formulations have been extensively used for plant growth and development, including nano-based associated pesticides and fertilizers in the modern agricultural system. Understanding the interactions between plants and NMs opens up new paths for improving agricultural crop yield and quality.

Saflufenacil is a protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor widely used for preplant control of broadleaf weeds, and it can be combined with other active ingredients, such as glyphosate, as a result of their synergistic effect in the field. Currently, the available commercial products are formulated as waterdispersible granules (WDGs) or aqueous suspension concentrates (SCs) and the application requires an oil-based tank mix adjuvant to ensure biological efficacy. In this scenario, an oil-dispersion (OD) formulation would represent an interesting option for enhancing sustainability of the system because it uses an all-in-one concept and removes the need for a tank mix adjuvant. On the other hand, oil dispersions are usually challenging to formulate and stabilize. In this work, we present a market-load saflufenacil OD formulation to replace both WDG and SC formulation systems applied with a tank mix adjuvant. Our solution delivers a higher rate of control of some broadleaves than current products, involves lower doses of chemicals applied on the field, and achieves a highly stable formulation through an easy process with few components. The project was carried out in four steps: (1) an extensive screening of components using an emulsion stability protocol for selection; (2) rheology profile studies; (3) a complete stability study according to the Collaborative International Pesticides Analytical Council (CIPAC) and Brazilian standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas [ABNT]); and (4) biological efficacy trials in the greenhouse and field for control of Conyza spp., Ipomea spp., and other broadleaf species. The deliveries to be presented comprise a process to formulate in two simple steps an OD formulation with excellent stability and rheological profiles even in the absence of a thickener agent. Our saflufenacil OD formulation showed similar and superior performance in the control of Conyza spp. and Ipomea spp. weeds, respectively, compared to the benchmark protocol.  © 2022 by ASTM International.",NA

Special focus is given to microRNA-based technology, heterologous systems expression of enzymes and pathways leading to products of interest, as well as applications using both model and non-model plant species. Metabolic engineering is usually defined as the re-routing of one or more enzymatic reactions to generate new compounds, increase the production of existing compounds, or facilitate the degradation of compounds. Plants are the foundation of numerous compounds which are synthesized via assimilated complex biosynthetic routes. Plants have evolved an incredible arrangement of metabolic pathways leading to molecules/compounds capable of responding promptly and effectively to stress situations imposed by biotic and abiotic factors, some of which supply the ever-growing needs of humankind for natural chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, agrochemicals, food and chemical additives, biofuels, and biomass. However, in foreseeable future we will be forced to think about the accessibility of resources for the generations to come. For these reasons, the book proposes alternative options of food/food supplement, medicines and other essential items, by using plant metabolic engineering approach. This book is of interest to teachers, researchers and academic experts. Also, the book serves as additional reading material for undergraduate and graduate students of biotechnology and molecular biology of plants. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",NA
Fuentes-Campos M.E.; Carranza-Oropeza M.V.,Nanoencapsulation of Neem Oil Using Inulin and Modified Starch for Use as Bioinsecticide,2022,Proceedings of the World Congress on New Technologies,NA,NA,NA,10.11159/icnfa22.127,"Nowadays the use of nanotechnology is increasing in different fields, for example in agriculture the use of nanocarriers for pesticides is important for disease control of plants. Many researchers are focusing on control release formulations (CRF) of bioactive compounds present in essential oils (EOs) as alternatives for reducing the risks to the environment and effects on health. Essential oils contain active metabolites such as terpenes, alkaloids, monoterpenes, limonoids, and others [1]. These metabolites have antifeeding properties against the insects since these when in contact decrease their activity. However, the biggest inconvenience of using essential oils is their chemical instability in the presence of factors such as air, light, dry, and high temperatures which cause rapid evaporation and degradation of the active components [2]. To solve these problems surge nanocarriers that can encapsulate EO through the polymeric matrix for it is important to investigate resources that have advantages as available, feasible, and safe for handling; the polysaccharides as starch, cellulose, chitosan, inulin are examples of these advantages [3]. Our research involves the use of inulin and modified starch as major encapsulating matrices for neem oil formulation using a green method for obtaining nanoparticles of polysaccharides and modification of starch with citric acid, two formulations for encapsulating neem oil were prepared: One with inulin and other with inulin-modified starch using green solvent and conditions as gelatinization temperature [4]. The morphology, physical and chemical characterization was performed by attaining FT-IR, FE-SEM, DLS, and UV-Vis. The stability of solids showed major stability in the inulin matrix, the shape of this matrix was spherical, and uniform compared and inulin-starch. Functional groups of nanoencapsulation of neem were confirmed by FT-IR and finally the characteristic peak the absorbance of neem was detected by UV-Vis at 296nm. © 2022, Avestia Publishing.

The present-day agriculture is facing several bottlenecks in maintaining productivity in shrinking resources. On the other hand, crop losses from insect pests are increasing. Different chemical-based pesticides used in crop protection are directly or indirectly affecting living beings and the environment. Different ways were worked out to solve this problem, and nanotechnology is one of the most effective methods in the management of insect pests in agriculture. This technology helps in increment in crop yield along with plant protection against a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Different nanoparticles (NPs), such as Ag NPs, Au NPs, Mg(OH)2 NPs, magnetite NPs, and essential oil NPs, are being used for insect pest control. These nanoparticles are formulated in lipid, polymer, clay, metal, and other nanoformulations for better delivery of active ingredients. Key benefits of nanopesticides are low dose, high active ingredient loading, slow and controlled release, biodegradable, reduced losses, protection against photodegradation, etc. There is a long way to go in nanopesticide research in pest management, and different ways are looked upon for reducing off-target effects and other demerits of nanopesticides. Therefore, to sustainably protect plants from insect pests, the use of bioconjugated nanomaterial-based insecticides and pesticides could be a viable option that would be desirable in precision farming. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021",NA

Formulation secrecy remains an impediment to the study of nearly all processes. Spray drift from aerial and ground equipment has been characterized and is predictable by probabilistic empirical rules. Volatilization of pesticide active ingredients from application deposits on plants and soil have been physically modeled and are part of the mass balance of a few PEC models. Measurement and modeling of plant uptake, translocation, and degradation of pesticides has considerably advanced recently. Soil sorption understanding has benefited from some revealing isotope-exchange studies, and the coupling of sorption and biotic degradation in soils has become a standard part of advanced PEC modeling. Spatial variability of sorption and degradation from point to field scale is much better understood and has been incorporated into modeling to a limited extent. Understanding pesticide leaching via preferential flow has been aided by modeling studies.

The damage caused by agricultural pests combined with the harmful effects of synthetic chemicals used in their control can be mitigated or eliminated by using botanicals, which are derived from renewable resources including a mixture of various bioactive ingredients. Therefore, finding a suitable alternative way for controlling this pest is necessary by considering the resistance to acaricides, as well as undesirable effects of chemical compounds. The present work aims to evaluate microcapsule essential oil of Mentha piperita and its lethal and sublethal toxicity to T. urticae. Materials and Methods Laboratory bioassays were used for evaluating the sublethal effects of peppermint essential oil microcapsules on biological and population parameters of T. urticae. The life table parameters of T. urticae were conducted on leaf discs under laboratory conditions at 25 ± 2°C, 60 ± 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L: D) hours. Then, the duration of each stage, developmental time, and survival were observed and recorded daily. In addition, the raw data were analyzed based on age stage two-sex life table theory with MS-Chart. Results Based on the results, microcapsules of Menthe piperita caused a significant reduction in fecundity and longevity. Those treated with LC20 and LC30 had a significant reduction at net reproductive rate, compared to those treated with LC10 and untreated ones. The intrinsic and finite rate of increase reduced significantly in higher concentration compared to the control. In addition, the mean generation time decreased significantly at the upper dose, compared with LC10. Discussion Botanic acaricides can be used for controlling Tetranychus urticae, and the microencapsulated formulation of these products makes them more stable. Familiarity with the chemical nature of the bio-active pesticide/acaricidal compound can be considered in future research which can play a role in developing an effective and environmentally friendly treatment against spider mites, leading to a decrease in reliance on synthetic pesticides/acaricides. The results of this study can be used in designing the mentioned pest management programs by considering the detrimental effects of M. piperita essential oil microcapsule on some biological parameters of T. urticae. © 2021 Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.",NA

Metarhizium flavoviride was among the first fungus to be recognized as a bio-control agent against desert locust in the laboratory and field conditions. Nevertheless, its oil formulation adversely affected nontarget organisms, hence led to further research on other microorganisms. Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum (syn. Metarhizium acridum) is an environmentally safer bio-pesticide that has no measurable impact on non-target organisms. However, there are various shortcomings associated with its use in desert locust control as highlighted in this review. Bacterial pathogens studied were from species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Serratia. Botanical extracts of 27 plant species were tested against the locust but showed varied results. Azadirachta indica and Melia volkensii were the most studied plant species, both belonging to family Meliaceae, which is known to have biologically active limonoids. Out of the 20 plant families identified, Apiaceae was the most represented with a frequency of 21%. However, only crude botanical extracts were used and therefore, the active ingredients against desert locust were not identified. Through a comprehensive research, an integrated pest management strategy that incorporates these bio-controls would be a realistic option to control desert locust infestations. © CAB International 2021.",NA

Nanotechnology techniques are recently used in developing agrochemical formulations. Nanoemulsions as new approaches have attracted great attention in delivering many poorly soluble in water active compounds. In this study, the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin) were formulated as nanoemulsions by high-energy ultrasonication. The droplet sizes of prepared nanoemulsions have been investigated by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), characterization result reveals the size of particles in the range 24.42-84.99 nm. Formulated nanoemulsions in comparison with the active ingredient (a.i) and emulsifier concentrate (EC) were evaluated against 4th instar larvae of S. littoralis. The in vivo activity levels of targeted enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) were studied in two bioassay methods (leaf dipping and topical application). Our finding showed that cypermethrin nanoemulsion has the highest activity with LC50 = 19.92 mg/l and LD50= 2.11 ng/larva. Furthermore, the developed nano-formulation showed adequate toxicity levels on AChE and ATPase compared to the active ingredient and EC formulations. The protein-ligand docking was also studied, and the docking poses showed that the insecticides had an excellent binding affinity to the active site of the target enzymes. On this basis, these results suggest that oil in water (O/W) nanoemulsions would be beneficial and can be applied for delivery insecticide formulations. © 2021 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)",NA

In order to shed light on its toxicological effects on aquatic ecosystems, documentary synthesis has enabled us to establish its toxicity on fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. Thus, LC50-96 h (Median Lethal Concentrations over 96 h) on fish vary from 0.03 mg / L (Ictalurus punctatus) to 975 mg / L (Phalloceros caudimaculatus). Recurrent chronic effects in fish include impaired memory, reduced mobility, damage to haematological parameters and several histopathological lesions on the gills, digestive tract, liver and kidney. In invertebrates, LC50s vary from 3-100 mg ai / L (Daphnia magna) to 147 mg ai / L (Ceriodaphnia dubia) with, among other chronic effects, disturbances of reproduction and development, disturbances of cardiac functions and parameters of oxidative stress. LC50s vary in amphibians from 78 mg a.i / L (Crinia insignifera) to 138.9 mg a.i / L (Rana clamitans). In conclusion, the toxic effects are induced by high concentrations of the pollutant, consequently, glyphosate is considered by the majority of authors to be of low toxicity to aquatic fauna. © 2021 International Formulae Group.

Pesticides as biologically active compounds posing potential hazard to worker’s health may cause both acute and chronic occupational poisonings (diseases). Apart from the occupational setting, many people get exposed to pesticides during their use in personal subsidiary plots. Various pesticide application techniques, such as ground-based boom spraying of field crops, air blast spraying of gardens, aerial spraying of fields and forests, treatment of greenhouses, seed dressing, fumigation of grain and warehouses, preparation and application of baits, require a differentiated approach to precautionary measures. Safety use practices for pesticides developed by F.F. Erisman Federal Scientific Center of Hygiene in the past shall be revised to incorporate changes in formulations, techniques, and regulations. Objective. To substantiate hazard-specific safety requirements for various pesticide application techniques and equipment in the agricultural industry. Materials and methods. We analyzed regulatory documents and guidelines, results of our own long-term studies, and publicly available information on the safe use of pesticides in agriculture. Оригинальная стаResults. Based on our findings, we suggest measures for the safe use of pesticides complying with appropriate regulations for the processed crops and application rules and taking into account conditions of the equipment used. We also provide recommendations for prevention of acute pesticide poisoning for agricultural workers, farmers and users from the standpoint of occupational health. Conclusion. It is important to develop a profound document summarizing occupational safety and health requirements for all pesticide use practices. © 2021, Federal Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the health problems of authorized pesticides. Risk assessment was evaluated by 1) Toxicological classification of the WHO, and 2) Bio-Pesticides Database (BPDB) and Pesticide Properties Data Base (PPDB). The 2015 Algerian index of phytosanitary products used in agriculture includes 173 active ingredients (IAs) belonging to 83 chemical groups represented by 757 commercial formulations (CF) categorized into: 36% fungicides, 29% insecticides and 22% herbicides. One-third of the AIs are not approved according to EC 91/414 directive. Otherwise, only 3% and 6% of AIs are classified as extremely and highly hazardous respectively. About 47%, 37% and 30% of IAs can cause eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation respectively while approximately 32%, 13%, 10% and 8% of AIs can have/be reproductive and/or developmental effects, neurotoxic effects, cholinesterase inhibitors and endocrine disruptors respectively when only 5% and almost 3% of AIs are carcinogenic and mutagenic, respectively. It is essential to periodically update the list of authorized pesticides at national level in accordance with international legislation and bans. On the other hand, farmers must be aware of the health risks due to each AI to which they are exposed. Also, farmers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE). On the other hand, continuous epidemiological studies aimed primarily at farmers and their families must be carried out and the results of these studies must be accessible to researchers. © Bettiche et al., 2021.",NA

Concretely it has been evaluated the influence of the anodic material used. It is hypothesized that such partial oxidation step could be considered as a pre-treatment for a subsequent biological treatment. At first, atrazine was extracted from a polluted soil by means of a surfactant-aided soil-washing process. Then, four different anodic materials were studied in partial electro-oxidation pre-treatment batch experiments at different electric charges applied: Boron Doped Diamond (BDD), Carbon Felt (CF), and Mixed Metal Oxides Anodes with Iridium and Ruthenium. Atrazine, TOC, surfactant and sulphate species concentrations, as well as changes in toxicity and biodegradability, were monitored during electrochemical experiments, showing important differences in their evolution during the treatment. It was observed that BDD was the most powerful anodic material to completely degrade atrazine. The other materials achieve an atrazine degradation rate about 75%. Regarding mineralization of the organics in SWE, BDD overtakes clearly the rest of anodes tested. CF obtains good atrazine removal but low mineralization results. All the anodes tested slightly reduced the ecotoxicity of the water effluents. About the biodegradability, only the effluent obtained after the pre-treatment with BDD presented a high biodegradability. In this sense, it must be highlighted the mineralization obtained during the BDD pre-treatment was very strong. These results globally indicate that it is necessary to find a compromise between reaching efficient atrazine removal and biodegradability improvement, while also simultaneously avoiding strong mineralization. Additional efforts should be made to find the most adequate working conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA

In this paper, the quantity of single herbicides (including technical products) and mixtures registered on four staple food crops were analyzed, and the quantity of single herbicides and formulations were also analyzed. Moreover, the active ingredients with high dosages were selected and analyzed in terms of formulation and control target. Finally, four active ingredients, three crops and three control targets with the largest dosage were selected as possible combinations for further analysis. The results showed that the highest dosage, mean dosage and dosage range of single herbicides were as followed: paddy field>wheat field> corn field>potato field; 15 active ingredients with high dosages were selected and the potential problems, large recommended dosage differences and abnormal high value points, were found in MCPA-sodium, 2,4-D-sodium, tribenuron-methyl, pretilachlor, butachlor, 2,4-D dimethyl amine salt, and MCPA-dimethyl amine salt; the highest active ingredient dosage of single herbicides was observed in the formulation of water soluble powder and for the control targets of broadleaf weeds and Cyperaceae weeds. There were obvious problems, large recommended dosage differences and abnormal high value points in the combinations of MCPA-sodium+rice+broadleaf weeds and MCPA-sodium+rice+Cyperaceae weeds, which were attributed to the differences of formulations and companies. In order to reduce the dosage of herbicides, it is suggested that the herbicide varieties with lower dosages of active ingredients should be used based on the study of the minimum effective dose of herbicides. © 2020 Editorial Board of Journal of Plant Protection.

They have been used for treatment of different diseases of human beings worldwide since the beginning of human civilization. Among the plant community, one of the genus Ocimum L. belonging to the family Lamiaceae is of high value in terms of economic upliftment and product development. Most of the species under this genus are cultivated throughout the tropical and the subtropical agro-climatic zones for medicine and for extraction of essential oils for product development in aroma-based pharmaceutical industries. The growth form of this aromatic genus Ocimum can be categorized as herbs, under-shrubs or shrubs that on distillation yield essential oils of various active aroma chemicals, such as eugenol, methyl eugenol, linalool, methyl chavicol, germacrene A and D, elemicin, Β-elmene and (Z)-ocimine, and several other active constituents. These volatile compounds have a tremendous value in pharmaceutical, modern perfumery and food processing industries. Evaluation of biological activities of active ingredients of Ocimum indicated great medicinal properties, such as anti-biotic, anti-cancerous, anti-ageing, anti-stress, antipyretic, diaphoretic, diuretic, stomachic, anti-microbial and insecticidal, and other similar importance in herbal formulations. A survey on 40 genetic stocks (or accessions) of Ocimum available at the CSIR-CIMAP belonging to five species, viz. Ocimum basilicum L. (25: French basil 7, Sweet basil 6, Zanzibar basil 1, Indian basil 10 and Thai basil 1), Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (9: Krishna/holy basil 4 and Shyam tulsi 5), Ocimum kilimandscharicum Baker ex Gurke (1: Champhor tulsi), Ocimum africanum Lour. (2: Hoary basil) and Ocimum gratissimum L. (3: African basil/van tulsi/tree basil/clove basil), was undertaken for study. It has been observed that some selected lines of Ocimum produce high quantities of essential oils, like Ocimum tenuiflorum (O. sanctum L.) CIM-Ayu (80% eugenol) and EOH-1 (89.75% methyl chavicol). These active ingredients have high international demand for aroma-based value additions and product development from essential oils. Extension and promotion of these Ocimum species will add and contribute to the economic upliftment of the developing countries like India and elsewhere in the world. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",NA

While some of them have beneficial effects in ecosystem services through plant pollination and natural pest control, there are numerous quarantine insect pests causing considerable damage to crop production and storage. Consequently, in crop pest management, the application of effective insecticides is extremely needed, and at selection of appropriate active compounds, the effects of insecticides or their residues on non-target organisms should be considered. The application of synthetic insecticides could result in the resistance of the target insect against the applied insecticide. Therefore, recently, a great attention has been devoted to insecticide formulations using active compounds of natural origin that are less toxic than conventional synthetic insecticides, exert the effects exclusively on the target insect and closely related organisms, are very effective in very small doses, are characterized with rapid decomposition, and, due to short exposure, practically do not contribute to environmental pollution. Using a nanotechnology approach, insecticide formulations with the enhanced bioavailability of active ingredients enabling their targeted delivery, controlled release, protection against degradation, and higher effectiveness could be prepared. In this manner, the overuse of these toxic compounds could be avoided resulting in the reduced contamination of the environment and representing an economically favorable solution.

While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus® (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III® (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0–1000 μg glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l−1]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, ∼50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10–1000 μg glyphosate ae l−1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 μg glyphosate l−1, but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 μg l−1 influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments. © 2018",NA
Jarvis N.,Meta-analysis of pesticide sorption in subsoil,2018,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,37,755,761,10.1002/etc.4011,"Models used to assess leaching risks generally use organic carbon partition coefficient (kOC) values derived from batch experiments on topsoil samples to estimate pesticide sorption in subsoils of much smaller organic carbon contents. This can introduce significant errors in leaching risk calculations, because inorganic sorbents can play an important role for sorption in subsoil. The objectives of the present study were therefore to summarize the available literature data on pesticide sorption in subsoils and to test whether a simple alternative model could improve on the standard kOC approach used in risk assessment models for pesticide leaching. This model describes the sorption constant as a power law function of the organic carbon content. A database with the results of batch sorption experiments was collated from published studies that emphasized measurements in subsoils. This database contains 1029 data entries from 36 published studies with data for 29 active substances (11 nonionic compounds, 10 weak acids, 6 weak bases, one cation, and one zwitterion). The results show that whereas the constant kOC model proved to be an adequate model for 17 of the 63 individual datasets, the power law model gave acceptable fits (p < 0.05) for 60 of these cases. The exponent in the power law model varied over a wide range, from slightly negative to near unity. It also differed significantly (p = 0.015) for ionized and nonionized compounds, with median values of 0.25 and 0.55, respectively. It is concluded that the power law model could be used to parameterize subsoil sorption in regulatory leaching models, because it has widespread applicability and is simple enough for this purpose.

Sinapis alba L. and Brassica napus L., grown in a greenhouse, were sprayed at the 2-to 2.5-true-leaf stage and harvested about 3 weeks following spraying. A four parameter nonlinear regression model of fresh weight on log-dose of phenmedipham formulations was fitted simultaneously to all response curves within an experiment. Since the active ingredient was the same in all formulations, the five and eight response curves in the S. alba and the B. napus experiments, respectively, were assumed to be parallel; i.e., the regression parameters were similar for all response curves except for the parameter determining their horizontal location. Betanal was about threefold more potent in S. alba (ED50 = 0.37 ℓ ha-1) than in B. napus (ED50 = 1.09 ℓ ha-1). The potencies of test formulations relative to Betanal were used to rank their phytotoxicity. In the S. alba experiment only one of the four test formulations was as effective as Betanal, and in the B. napus experiment three of the seven tested formulations were as active as Betanal. The results were discussed in relation to the effect of formulation constituents on phenmedipham phytotoxicity, differences in retention of the spray solution, and the cuticular characteristics of the two test species. © 1989 by CRC Press, Inc.",NA

In a factorial experiment with three randomized blocks, wild oat grown outdoors in pots was sprayed with four doses of difenzoquat (l,2-dimethyl-3,5-diphenyl-pyrazolium). Difenzoquat was applied either alone or in mixture with 60 g/ha fenvalerate (ct-cyano-3- phenoxybenzyl-Α-[4-chlorophenyl]-3-methyl-butyrate); 125 g/ha propiconazole (l-[2-{2,4- dichlorphenyl-4-propyl-l,3-dioxolan-2-yl}-methyl]-lH-l,2,4-triazole); or 60 g/ha fenvalerate plus 125 g/ha propiconazole. All active ingredients were applied as commercial formulations. The results showed that neither propiconazole nor fenvalerate affected plant growth when applied alone. Hence, the four difenzoquat dose-response curves were assumed parallel when the plant responses were plotted against the logarithm of the difenzoquat dose, and at each spray volume a regression model of plant response on log dose was fitted simultaneously to each dose-response curve. The relative potencies between difenzoquat applied alone or in mixture with different pesticides were independent of the response level considered. At both spray volumes, propiconazole and propiconazole plus fenvalerate promoted the action of difenzoquat. Fenvalerate, however, did not affect the activity of difenzoquat. In general, the herbicidal effect was enhanced by a reduction in spray volume. The results are discussed in relation to the different formulations of propiconazole and fenvalerate. © 1989 by CRC Press, Inc.",NA

The toxicity of pesticides is influenced by their chemical stability, solubility, bioavailability, photodecomposition, and soil sorption; therefore one of possible solutions designed to minimize the dose-dependent toxicity of active ingredients includes the development of nanocarriers able to modify the properties of active ingredients and allow their controlled delivery and release. However, the causal link between nanoengineered pesticide properties and their biological effects is not well known and represents an important challenge of nanoecotoxicology.

This weed is considered to be a cause of allergic respiratory problems, contact dermatitis, mutagenicity in human and livestock. Crop production is drastically reduced owing to its allelopathy. Also aggressive dominance of this weed threatens biodiversity. Eradication of P. hysterophorus by burning, chemical herbicides, eucalyptus oil and biological control by leaf-feeding beetle, stem-galling moth, stem-boring weevil and fungi have been carried out with variable degrees of success. Recently many innovative uses of this hitherto notorious plant have been discovered. Parthenium hysterophorus confers many health benefits, viz remedy for skin inflammation, rheumatic pain, diarrhoea, urinary tract infections, dysentery, malaria and neuralgia. Its prospect as nano-medicine is being carried out with some preliminary success so far. Removal of heavy metals and dye from the environment, eradication of aquatic weeds, use as substrate for commercial enzyme production, additives in cattle manure for biogas production, as biopesticide, as green manure and compost are to name a few of some other potentials. The active compounds responsible for hazardous properties have been summarized.

Insect pests reduce plant productivity and threaten animal health. There are 1500 entomogenous microorganisms with interesting entomological-ecological specificity. MIs sicken or kill insects as whole microorganisms or their insecticidal bioproducts. MIs and chemical insecticides (CIs) are distinct. MIs, whether protein toxins or pathogenic cells, act in a multistep and multistage manner causing morbidity-mortality phenomena. CIs provide a quick knockdown effect that MIs do not. MIs are safe to nontarget organisms (NTOs) including humans. CIs must be used for periodic reduction of pest population size or their spread, irrespective of our perspectives on insect biodiversity or risk-hazard equation. Central to MIs is genes encoding for entomocidal proteins, toxic secondary metabolites, and overall pathology. Also, the relative ease of propagation and formulation produces significant advantages. MIs can persist for variable times sometimes establishing epizootics limiting population spread. Contributions of microbial physiology and genetics, applied microbiology, fermentation and formulation technologies, applied entomology, and biotechnology have been pivotal to MI development. A new era for interdisciplinary engagement in molecular biology, genomic, and proteomic aspects of MI is facilitating forward moves beyond the proof of concept and deployment of MI and their commercial products. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This conclusion is based partly upon estimates of the rate of carbon dioxide emission during the combustion of fossil fuels, relative to the rate of its uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (Loh, 2002). A very different threshold, however, had already been crossed several decades earlier with the birth of the modern chemical industry, which produced novel substances for which no such natural assimilative capacity existed. Among these new chemical compounds, none has posed a greater challenge to the planet’s ecosystems than synthetic pesticides, compounds that have been intentionally released into the hydrologic system in vast quantities—several hundred million pounds of active ingredient (a.i.) per year in the United States alone (Donaldson et al., 2002)—for many decades. To gauge the extent to which we are currently able to assess the environmental implications of this new development in the Earth’s history, this chapter presents an overview of current understanding regarding the sources, transport, fate, and biological effects of pesticides, their transformation products, and selected adjuvants in the hydrologic system.

Blending products with different molecular weights is a technique that can be used to control the polarity of the overall solvent system. Alkylene carbonates are currently being evaluated as solvents and co-solvents in agricultural formulations. They can add to the effectiveness of pesticide formulations and adjuvants due to their high solvency and low VOC. These are just some of the characteristics of alkylene carbonates that can combine to produce better penetration and sticking of the active ingredient. Higher molecular weight carbonates can be incorporated into formulations to improve rain-fastness and solubility of all formulation components.

The spray application process can be viewed as a series of interdependent events, namely formulation, atomization, spray transfer and interaction with the plant surface leading to retention and penetration. Adjuvants play a role in each event for they are used extensively in formulation and as a tank mix during application. They facilitate solubilzation of the active ingredient and modify the physico-chemical properties of the spray solution. The size distribution of the spray may be shifted to a lower or higher VMD by surfactants and drift retardants, respectively. Spray retention and spreading are increased on difficult to wet plant surfaces. Foliar penetration can be increased by stomatal pore infiltration by surfactants that lower surface tension to < 30 mN m-1. Transcuticular penetration may be depressed by adjuvants that do not penetrate, but reside on the surface, in the spray droplet residue and solubilize/complex the agrochemical in micelles (or other momomer agregrates) and effectively reducing the driving force. Other surfactants penetrate into the cuticle and plasticize the waxes, leading to increased transcuticular diffusion of the active ingredient. Implications for the presence of multiple spray additives in the spray solution and droplet residue on performance of the active ingredient are stressed. Copyright © 2003 by ASTM International.",NA

The solutions are optically transparent and almost any enzyme can be solubilized in reverse micelles without loss of its specific activity. Reverse micelles provide a unique microenvironment for enzymes to react with water insoluble or poorly water soluble compounds present in the organic phase. It is possible to use even multi-enzyme systems to carry out a sequence of transformations. The presence of surfactant in the medium helps to overcome diffusion resistance and enzymes entrapped in hydrophilic gels such as polyacrylamide or calcium alginate can also be used for biotransformation of hydrophobic substrates and recycled several times. The solubilization of gelatin in reverse micelles to form organogels and solubilization of microbial cells in water-in-oil microemulsions without loss of viability have opened up new possibilities. Entrapped enzymes in such organogels or 'gelozymes' can be used in organic solvents without the use of surfactant, simplifying the workup procedure. Enzymatic reactions requiring co-factors such as reduction with alcohol dehydrogenase and epoxidation with monooxygenase can be carried out with whole cells. This is review discusses various applications of enzymes entrapped in reverse micelles and organogels for resolution of amino acids, peptide synthesis, reduction of prochiral ketones, synthesis of glycerides and chiral intermediates useful in production of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. The possibilities of substrate isolation, surfactant reuse and enzyme recycling with the help of bioreactors are also discussed.",NA

Furthermore, and under optimum conditions, the FITC precolumn derivatization of the anilines was performed in real water (e.g., tap and lake water) spiked with anilines at the LOD level. The water matrices showed marginal effects on the extent of derivatization at the LOD level, and the possible interferents in the water samples did not affect the FITC-solute signal due to the selectivity of the derivatization and detection schemes. Besides filtration from microparticles, the real water samples did not necessitate extensive sample cleanup prior to derivatization.",NA

Improvements in pesticide use efficiency will require a more intensive study of the physical and physiochemical parameters controlling droplet dynamics, deposition on defined targets and biological response. The biological effect depends on the toxicological properties of the active ingredient (AI), its formulation, the concentration and pattern of the dose at the point of action. Changes in formulation of a pesticide may result in significant changes in pest response to and hence transfer of a toxin. Encapsulation of insecticides showed significant changes in avoidance/irritant reactions by certain pests vs that recorded for standard formulations. Droplet size also affected the performance of materials tested. Separation of drop (and particle) size, concentration, and formulation effects can be useful in understanding toxin activity and developing accurate parameters for specific targets and crop protection agents.

Some VOCs may also be PROCs. State and local agencies responsible for carrying out the mandate have indicated their desire to ban or limit the VOC content of household products as a remedy. Household pesticides have been included as a target. The benefits of pesticide products are maximized by their proper formulation which, only where necessary, include VOCs. A requirement to decrease VOC content of household products by an arbitrary amount implies that the formulas contain unnecessary amounts of VOC to begin with. Since low volatility products are often attractive in terms of safety and raw ingredient cost, the incentives for successfully formulating them exists. The legislative efforts aimed at reducing lower atmosphere ozone by proscribing VOC content of household pesticide formulas could reduce the health and safety benefits of such products by diminishing the efficiency and shelf llfe of many active ingredients while insignificantly impacting ozone levels. © 1989 ASTM International.

Beestman G.B.; Deming J.M.,"DEVELOPMENTS IN MICROENCAPSULATION, HIGH CONCENTRATION",1989,ASTM Special Technical Publication,NA,25,35,10.1520/STP26446S,"The earliest method of achieving microcapsules was the technique of coacervation. Polymers were used to disperse or suspend material to be microencapsulated. A polymer-rich phase was caused to develop in the suspension and envelop the suspended material. Further processing was required to harden the precipitated polymers to produce useful shell walls. Because coacervation was a dilute process and batch-to-batch variation was difficult to control, this technique did not gain wide practice in the microencapsulation of agricultural pesticides. Microencapsulation by interfacial polymerization was a major step toward agricultural applications. Water-soluble monomers in the aqueous phase were reacted with oil-soluble monomers in the oil phase to produce microcapsule shell walls at the interface of suspended droplets. Although more concentrated suspensions of microcapsules could be produced by interfacial polymerization, agricultural formulations were limited to about two pounds of active ingredient per gallon. Recent breakthroughs in interfacial polymerization have expanded this technology to concentrations of active ingredients typical of commercial agricultural products. Directly usable suspensions of microcapsules which can be diluted with formulating ingredients to contain four pounds of microencapsulated active ingredient per gallon have been made.

The apolar model solutes chosen are lindane, which is an organochloride pesticide (γ-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane), and phenol as a semipolar molecule. The curvature variation of the surfactant film induced by the solute has been determined using conductivity and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. This curvature effect is rationalized by means of the DOC cylinders model, combining fixed area per molecule, volume fraction, a strongly preferred spontaneous curvature constraint, and a low flexibility of the interfacial film (kc≫kBT). Scattering and conductivity properties examined together demonstrate that the shift in the surfactant packing parameter induced by solubilization corresponds to an increase of surfactant layer volume combined with a slight decrease of the area per headgroup.",NA

Separation optimization was also carried out for MEKC, showing that ACN and a high level of another additive γ-CD were needed to achieve effective separation of these analytes.

In addition, analytical time in MEEKC was longer than that in MEKC, but in view of theoretical plate numbers, detection limits, and reproducibility, both methods were effective for the analysis of BU insecticides and their analogs. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

However, food-grade microemulsions are difficult to formulate and no microemulsion has been documented for antifungal purpose. The physicochemical characterization of a food-grade glycerol monolaurate (GML)/ethanol (EtOH)/Tween 80/potassium sorbate (PS)/water microemulsion system and the antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum have been studied in this paper. Methods and Results: The influence of EtOH and PS on oil solubilization capability was clearly reflected in the phase behaviour of U-type microemulsion systems. One dilution-stable formulation ME (GML/EtOH/Tween 80/PS/water = 3 : 3 : 3.5 : 10.5 : 16) was selected. After 4 days of incubation, ME showed 80%A. niger growth inhibition at 0.2% and 72%P. italicum growth inhibition at 0.1%, respectively, and a delay of conidiation of 2 days compared with the control. In the antifungal activities of the microemulsion, GML and PS made major contributions with similar antifungal activities at a GML/PS weight ratio of 1: 3.5. Conclusions: Food-grade dilution-stable microemulsions prepared with GML as oil phase for antifungal purpose are feasible and solubilization of a hydrotrope contributes to the formation of microemulsions and enhanced antifungal activities. Significance and Impact of the Study: The present report represents the first to develop a food-grade microemulsion system for antifugal purpose. © 2008 The Authors.",NA

As a matter of fact, the European Sewage Sludge Directive 86/278/EEC seeks to encourage the disposal of sewage sludge in agriculture applications and regulate its use to prevent harmful effects on the soil environment. At the present time, the sewage sludge Directive is under revision and a possible cut-off limit for some organic chemicals may be implemented. Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS), the main synthetic anionic surfactant, has been included in the draft list of chemicals to be limited. The present research work deals with the monitoring of LAS and soap in Spanish sewage sludge. The average concentration of LAS found in anaerobic sewage sludge samples was 8.06g/kg, higher than the average values for European sludge. Besides, it has been also found that more than 55% of Spanish anaerobic sludge would not fulfil the limit proposed by the 3rd European Working paper on sludge. As a consequence, the implementation of the limit for LAS would make the disposal of most Spanish biosolids for agricultural applications almost impossible. Regarding the mechanisms why anionic surfactants are found in sludge, two surfactants are compared: LAS and soap, both readily biodegraded in aerobic conditions. Irrespective of the anaerobic biodegradability of soap, its concentration found in sludge is higher than LAS (only anaerobically biodegradable under particular conditions). The relevance of anaerobic biodegradation to assure environmental protection is discussed for this case. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA

Treated, partially treated, and even untreated water from wastewater treatment plants is discharged directly into rivers, thereby degrading the quality of the water. Consequently, irrigation water may contain surfactants which may affect the fate and transport of chemicals such as pesticides and antibiotics in agricultural soils. A field lysimeter study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the nonionic surfactant, Brij 35, on the fate and transport of an antibiotic, Oxytetracycline, commonly used in cattle farms. Nine PVC lysimeters, 1.0 m long × 0.45 m diameter, were packed with a sandy soil to a bulk density of 1.35 Mg m-3. Cattle manure, containing Oxytetracycline, was applied at the surface of the lysimeters at the recommended rate of 10 t/ha. Each of three aqueous Brij 35 solutions, 0, 0.5 and 5 g L-1 (i.e., 'good,' 'poor' and 'very poor' quality irrigation water) were each applied to the lysimeters in triplicate. Over a 90 day period, soil and leachate samples were collected and analyzed. Batch experiment results showed that the presence of the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 significantly reduced the sorption coefficient of OTC from 23.55 mL g-1 in the aqueous medium to 19.49, 12.49 and 14.53 in the presence of Brij 35 at concentrations of 0.25, 2.5 and 5 g L-1, respectively. Lysimeter results indicted the significant downward movement of OTC at depths of 60 cm into soil profile and leachate in the presence of surfactant. Thus, the reuse of wastewater containing surfactants might enhance the mobility of contaminants and increase ground water pollution. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",NA

Different variables that affect derivatization (pH, FITC concentration, time and temperature) and separation (pH and concentration of the buffer, kind and concentration of surfactants and applied voltage) were studied. The analysis was conducted within about 8 min and the use of the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 improved the selectivity, thus indirectly enhancing sensitivity by shifting of the interfering peaks of the FITC excess. Dynamic ranges of 2.0-3000 μg/L, limits of detection at microgram or submicrogram-per-liter level, and relative standard deviations from 4.7 to 6.4% were obtained. The ensuing method - nonionic surfactant MEKC - is a useful choice for the determination of these herbicides as it provides limits of detection similar or lower than those reported by existing chromatographic alternatives without the use of an additional preconcentration technique such as solid-phase extraction. The separation of a mixture of nine FITC-derivatized amino acids, selected as target compounds, was also carried out to assess the discrimination power of the nonionic surfactant MEKC method for the analysis of closely related anionic analytes.",NA

Methods and Results: Five BS-producing bacteria were isolated from fuel oil-contaminated soil. Among them, Burkholderia cenocepacia BSP3 exhibited the highest emulsification index and was chosen for further study. Glucose-containing medium supplemented with nitrate or sunflower seed oil provided suitable conditions for growth and BS production. The BS was identified as a glucolipid, having a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 316 mg l-1. It could lower the surface tension of deionized water to 25 ± 0.2 mN m-1 and exhibited good emulsion stability. Finally, the application of the BS to facilitate pesticide solubilization demonstrated that this BS at the concentration below and above its CMC could enhance the apparent water solubility of three pesticides, i.e. methyl parathion, ethyl parathion and trifluralin. Conclusions: Burkholderia cenocepacia BSP3 is a BS-producing bacterium isolated from oil-contaminated soil. The BS was identified as a glucolipid having a molecular mass of 550.4 g mol-1. An apparent yield of the BS was 6.5 ± 0.7 g l-1. This glucolipid-type BS noticeably enhanced pesticide solubilization suggesting its role in environmental remediation. Significance and Impact of the Study: A glucolipid type BS normally found in marine micro-organisms was isolated from a soil-bacterium. Due to its surface active properties and good performance in enhancement of pesticide solubilization, it could be used as a solubilizing agent for environmental remediation and synergistic treatment with bioremediation of pesticide-contaminated soil. © 2008 The Authors.",NA

A kinetic model approach,2009,Water Research,43,2481,2492,10.1016/j.watres.2009.03.016,"The simultaneous disappearance of four organophosphorous insecticides in a Mediterranean calcareous soil was evaluated in the presence of surfactant solutions and municipal wastewater. A cationic, an anionic and a non-ionic surfactant were used at a low (0.75 mg L-1) and at a high (twice the critical micelle concentration) concentration level. The cationic surfactant was also studied at a higher concentration. Dissipation in control soil was rapid for malathion (half-life 4 days), intermediate for dimethoate and methidathion (ca. 6 days) and slow for diazinon (29 days). Wastewater did either not modify (diazinon, dimethoate and methidathion) or slightly enhance (malathion) insecticide decay. The increase in concentration of the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 resulted in enhanced dissipation rates for all the pesticides except diazinon. The addition of the anionic surfactant did not show a clear trend. At the highest cationic surfactant concentration a reduction of pesticide disappearance occurred linked with a reduced availability, since the insecticides were retained on the surfactant-modified soil (final residual concentration of 85% for diazinon and ≈55% for methidathion and dimethoate). Soil microbial activity, estimated by measuring dehydrogenase activity, was low in wastewater- and surfactant-treated soil at the high levels. Fitting of the experimental data to commonly used mathematical models was poor and alternatives were looked for. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA

The appearance of the stomach contents suggested that ingestion of a surfactant had occurred before death. The spreading agent was found to contain nonionic nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOn) and anionic sulfonated naphthalene-formaldehyde condensates (SNFCn). A solid phase extraction cartridge containing a mixed reversed phase-weak anion exchange sorbent (Oasis WAX, Waters) was used to successfully extract both NPEOn and SNFCn from the blood. The cartridge was preconditioned with methanol and acetic acid (AcOH). After the dilute blood sample was applied to the cartridge, it was washed with AcOH, and then NPEOn and SNFCn were eluted with methanol/dichloromethane (7:3, v/v) and 5% NH3/80% methanol, respectively. The concentrations of NPEOn=2-9 and SNFCn=0 in the blood sample were 7.7μg/mL and 1.8mg/mL, respectively. It is possible that postmortem changes increased the concentration of SNFCn=0 monomer by breaking down the polymer. However, the behavior of these compounds in the human body is unclear and further case studies are needed to investigate this result. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA

Evaluation of octylmaltopyranoside chiral surfactant in the enantiomeric separation of fluorescently labeled phenoxy acid herbicides and their laser-induced fluorescence detection,1997,Electrophoresis,18,220,226,10.1002/elps.1150180208,"A novel chiral nonionic surfactant, namely octyl-b-D-maltopyranoside (OM), was evaluated in chiral capillary electrophoresis of fluorescently labeled phenoxy acid herbicides. The labeling of the analytes with 7-aminonaphthalene-1,3-disulfonic acid (ANDSA) permitted a concentration detection limit of 5 x 10-10 M using laser-induced fluorescence detection. This limit of detection allowed the determination of ultradiluted solutions of the ANDSA-derivatized phenoxy acid herbicides whose concentration was as low as 10-11 M (i.e. 2.2 ppt) by applying the concept of field-amplified sample stacking (FASS). The sample injection by FASS did not adversely affect separation efficiencies, resolution and reproducibility of the electrophoretic system. The tagging of the phenoxy acid herbicides with ANDSA increased the hydrophobicity of the analytes, thus favoring an enhanced solubilization of the derivatized herbicides in the OM micellar phase. The net results of this effect were a much shorter analysis time and an improved enantiomeric resolution of the derivatives when compared to underivatized phenoxy acid herbicides. The optimum surfactant concentration required for maximum resolution decreased with increasing hydrophobicity of the analyte, with the least hydrophobic analyte requiring higher surfactant concentration. Because of the two permanently charged sulfonic acid groups of the ANDSA tag, the pH of the running electrolyte had little effect on the enantiomeric resolution of the derivatized herbicides. Due to its salting-out effect and increasing the micellized surfactant concentration, increasing the ionic strength of the running electrolyte increased the enantiomeric resolution of the least hydrophobic analytes. Conversely, increasing the percent methanol in the running electrolyte decreased the enantiometric resolution of the least hydrophobic analytes due to a decrease strength of solute-micelle association. For hydrophobic analytes, existed an optimum percent of methanol existed for maximum enantiomeric resolution.",NA

Emulsifiable concentrate and wettable powder formulations of most insecticides were used to prepare sprays which contained a 1% concentration of the active ingredient. Fly populations on farms were estimated during summer by observing a series of natural resting places on each farm. Nearly all flies observed were either house flies or stable flies, Musca domestica. and Stomoxvs calcitrans. An approximation of residual effectiveness and species specificity of insecticide formulations was obtained also by observing the dying and newly dead flies on selected horizontal surfaces at several of the farms. All insecticides killed house flies effectively. Diazinon appeared to kill stable flies most effectively. Estimates were made of the range of residual fly control after spraying these insecticides. The following figures, based upon both over-all seasonal impressions and actual fly counts after spraying, provide an estimated range of effective fly control in days for house flies and stable flies, respectively: isochlorthion, 13-28 and 9-21; chlorthion, 3-28 and 10-28; diazinon, 8-31 and 7-35; Penthion-80, 10-14 and there were too few stable flies to make an estimate; and pirazinon, 8-22 and 7-22.

The presence of insects not only affects the composition of the dried citrus pulp but also makes it undesirable to shippers, warehousemen, and the consumer because of the danger of spreading the infestation to other commodities in the vicinity. Being an animal feed it must not contain any harmful insecticide residues and, therefore, the insecticides and the methods of applying them on this commodity are limited. The weekly aerosol applications of synergized pyrethrum commonly used for the past several years have been very expensive and not very effective. The problem has been to develop an effective low cost treatment acceptable under Section 406 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Laboratory tests showed that wettable powder formulations produced heavier, longer-lasting, and more toxic surface residues than aerosols containing the same active ingredients. This paper describes the evaluation of the practicability and comparative effectiveness of these findings under field conditions. Thirteen stacks of feed were treated with pyrethrum-piperonyl butoxide: 2 with aerosol formulations and 11 with the wettable powder formulations applied to the surface of the stacks. The insecticide residue obtained with wettable powder was more than 10 times that obtained with the aerosol treatment. Some of the insecticide migrated through the burlap bags, but the amount was very small in comparison with the amount that accumulated on the stack surface. The use of vinyl stack covers over the feed after two applications of the wettable powder appears very promising. The wettable powder was much more effective in maintaining a low insect population in the feed than the aerosol treatments. The tests also showed that it is practical to use monthly applications of wettable powders at the rate of 5 mg of pyrethrum and 50 mg of piperonyl butoxide per square foot to treat large quantities of stored citrus pulp and that the cost of treatment is less with wettable powders than with aerosols.",NA

The materials, as commercial preparations, included captan, copper (as ""dry"" Bordeaux mixture), dichlofluanid, didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), dispersible S, dithianon, dodine acetate, lime-S (LS), phenylmercury chloride (PMC), and thiram; they were assessed on the basis of percentage active ingredient in the dilutions. When acting at normal rates of use, many of the fungicides were much more effective protectively than curatively, but this contrast was less applicable to DDAB, dodine acetate, LS, and dichlofluanid. PMC, however, was an especially notable exception in proving curatively superior at unusually low rates. In addition, it was particularly active in vapor form, and was effectively translocated not only from one leaf surface to the other, but, especially at 0.005%, from sprayed to younger unsprayed leaves on the same shoots. Other standard fungicides showed little or no translocated activity, but isobutyl-o-coumarate was effective at the growing shoot-tips in spring from a spray applied to the lower leaves. PMC reduced infection when applied once at any time during the scab-incubation period, and especially 24 hours after infection, when the control was almost complete. Longer intervals before spraying reduced the curative action, but not in proportion to the intervals; the infection pattern showed multi-peak fungicidal activity and, after the later sprays, many lesions were practically infertile. The curative properties of PMC were matched by several other formulated phenylmercury salts compared at equivalent percentage mercury content, but the dimethyl-dithiocarbamate proved rather less effective. A preliminary attempt to supplement the curative properties of PMC with the protective properties of LS, by mixing these fungicides at low rates, showed evidence of fungicical antagonism, and this needs further investigation. Several fungicides, notably the inorganic sulphurs, thiram, the phenylmercury compounds, dichlofluanid, and DDAB showed incidental activity against natural infection by powdery mildew.",NA

The viability of B.t. spores was drastically reduced after 1 day of weathering but a high level of biological activity by the spore-crystal complex persisted for up to 20 days post-spray due probably to crystal activity. The addition of about 10% of the recommended operational rate of acephate to the B.t. suspension increased larval mortality by 34% when applied at 4.7 l/ha. Reductions in budworm populations were 97-99% in B.t. + acephate plots and 86-90% in B.t. alone plots.

Benomyl suppressed conidial sporulation, whereas 1 application of thiophanate methyl (0.14% a.i.) to perithecia inhibited ascospore release; half of this concentration applied to conidial lesions or pycnidia caused the perithecia formed subsequently to abort. Thiophanate methyl thus shows promise for blight control and elimination, and benomyl may be valuable as a supplement in later rounds of spraying to control conidial sporulation. After 6 days of showery rain (2 mm for 17 min/day), water collected from sprayed leaves still gave complete inhibition of spore germination. However, inhibition was markedly reduced after 6 days of heavy rain (over 8 mm for 24 min/day).",NA

In 1975, diquat applied at the same rate to a navy bean crop ''Seafarer'' 16 days before harvest, decreased seed moisture content by 123 mg g-1 below a control value of 364 mg g-1. Diquat applied at a lower rate (0.3 kg a.i. ha-1) caused a decrease of 79 mg g-1 and paraquat decreased seed moisture by 147 mg g-1. In both years smaller effects were observed for dimexan (15 kg a.i. ha-1) which decreased seed moisture content by 32 mg g-1 in 1974 and 72 mg g-1 in 1975 and for ethephon (1.0 kg a.i. ha-1) which caused decreases of 78 mg g-1 in 1974 and 31 mg g-1 in 1975. In 1975, metham-sodium (70 kg a.i. ha-1) a soil sterilant, proved almost as effective as the bipyridyls, decreasing moisture content by 105 mg g-1. Trimming the roots mechanically reduced seed moisture by 67 mg g-1. Other chemical treatments, tried in 1975 only, were less effective and decreased seed moisture content by 31-60 mg g-1.

The egg parasite Trichogramma cacoeciae March, reacted very strongly in laboratory tests as well as in the field under the influence of the herbicides. Contact toxicity tested on residues on glass plates caused a reduction of the degree of parasitization leading to total mortality of the population, in contaminated cages for some preparations. Part of this effect was caused by the zero formulation examined simultaneously. In the study of contact toxicity of spray deposit on single leaves as well as on whole plants, a strong effect on Trichogramma by some preparations was shown. Systemic application caused an effect after transportation of herbicides through the soil and the plant. This was demonstrated by a reduction of the degree of parasitization in comparison to untreated controls. The herbicides studied do not seem to have any influence on Chrysopa carnea Steph. larvae oradults. No effect was visible, neither in tests of contact toxicity or contaminated sandy soil nor in choice experiments on a repellent action of the residue or after topical application of the preparations. An overdosage of only 1 herbicide increased the mortality rate of the test larvae. The syrphid Epistrophe balteata DEG., reacted in a more sensitive manner on the influence of herbicides. In contact experiments of toxicity as well as in choice experiments for a possible repellent effect an influence on the larval stages of the herbicides examined was shown. If the herbicide was sprayed directly on the plant, an increase of larval mortality was observed. Adults of this syrphid showed reactions on herbicide residues. Females during egg deposition avoided surfaces previously treated by the herbicide (phenmedipham). In tests on a possible ovicidal effect of herbicides on the eggs of all 3 entomophagous species only 1 herbicide (chlorfenpropmethyl) reduced the rate of egg-hatching of syrphids. Damage depends on the species as well as on the herbicide applied and the type of application. Losses of sensitive entomophagous species in the field might well be possible according to the results obtained in experiments using certain herbicides.",NA

In both sowings, residues in the harvested radish were higher, dose-for-dose, from the granule than from the liquid treatment and with both formulations were lower in the 2nd than in the 1st sowing. Within treatments there were log-log relationships between the dose of insecticide and residue concentrations in the soil and radish. In both sowings the residues were most variable between replicate soil and crop samples from the granule treatment. In the 1st sowing, cabbage root fly damage was reduced most by the liquid treatment but in the 2nd sowing equivalent doses of the 2 formulations gave similar protection. At 2.0, 2.24 or 3.0 kg a.i./ha, chlorfenvinphos incorporated before sowing protected radish better than pre-sowing or pre-emergence applications to the soil surface. When applied before sowing, the liquid formulation gave better protection and lower residue concentrations in the radish than the granules. As a postemergence spray, chlorfenvinphos was much more effective than fonofos, diazinon or triazophos but it was often phytotoxic, decreased yield significantly, left large residues in the radish in 2 of 4 experiments and, in common with other surface treatments, substantially decreased the Z:E chlorfenvinphos isomer ratio.

Initial seedling stands for the control and the captan seed treatments were higher in field than in greenhouse evaluations, but coating the seed with either carboxin or captan + carboxin gave higher initial stands in the greenhouse. Final stands for all treatments were higher in field because of lower disease pressure from Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium spp. than in greenhouse tests. Both pre- and post-emergence damping-off were more severe in greenhouse than in field tests. Slightly higher stands were obtained with the high rate of the fungicide seed treatments. All formulations of each fungicide gave similar results when used at comparable rates of active ingredient. Carboxin was superior to captan in increasing plant populations under severe disease infestations. Stands were higher for captan + carboxin than for either fungicide used alone but were lower than the sum of the effects of each fungicide alone.",NA

The emulsifier alone did not cause injury. Dosages of the herbicide ranged from 0.84-6.72 kg/ha or 13.1-104.8 ppmw in the concentration in soils, and the lowest dosage was sufficient to induce the foliar injury. Leaves which developed during the exposure were markedly shortened, narrowed, and thickened, distorted in shape, and had an extremely poor lamina expansion and abnormal venation pattern. Severity of the foliar injury increased as the herbicide dosage and soil moisture increased and as the soil organic matter content decreased. Leaves which were partially expanded before the exposure were affected much less. When exposed to vapors of 14C-benefin, plant seedlings readily absorbed radioactive materials by its entire foliage including the stem tip with a few tiny developing leaves. More than half of the 14C absorbed and adsorbed during a 3-day exposure was recovered by CHCl3 wash of leaves and appeared to be retained by the wax and cutin layers, and also by lipoidal secretion substances of the numerous trichomes on the leaf surface. There was a small fraction of unabsorbed or loosely retained 14C material on the surface of the leaves and stem tip, which was removed by water. That not recovered from H2O and CHCl3 washes appeared to be distributed in the internal tissues. Little acropetal translocation appeared to occur from the expanded leaves toward the stem tip.

When granular, wettable powder, or emulsifiable concentrate formulations of diazinon were incorporated using the Adelphi mixer, neither the between-block variability nor the subsequent stability of the insecticide were significantly influenced by the formulation used. Insecticide stability was studied by incoporating chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and phorate at 10 mg a.i.[active ingredient]/block in Jan., March, May and July. The relative order of persistence was chlorfenvinphos .tbd. chlorpyrifos > phorate .mchgt. diazinon. There was little loss of insecticide (< 10%) from the blocks treated with chlorfenvinphos or chlorpyrifos, and the stability of the insecticides was unaffected by seasonal temperature changes, but the rate of loss of diazinon increased markedly from Jan. to July. The rate of oxidation of phorate to its sulfoxide and sulfone analogs increased gradually from Jan. to May but was much slower than in the field after a bow-wave application. With all insecticides, there was no significant difference in loss rates at 25 and 10 mg a.i./block. After incorporation into 3 moss peats and 2 proprietary blocking composts, there was no consistent difference in the rates of loss of either diazinon or of total phorate residues, although the rates of oxidation of phorate and its sulfoxide were not similar in all the peats and composts. The principal factor determining insecticide behavior in the blocks was the adsorptive capacity of the peat.",NA

In two experiments it was found that although the formulations reduced the number of larvae present they did not provide full control and were not as effective as conventional granular formulations. Reasons for this are discussed and it is postulated that the shortfall in control evinced by the controlled-release formulations could be due to uneven distribution because of their large particle size and/or a failure to release sufficient active ingredient.,NA

When sprayed in the laboratory on bean leaves, the deposit obtained from either formulation decreased as the percentage of molasses was increased. In an aerial application field trial on cotton, 10% molasses gave a smaller deposit of active ingredient than obtained in the absence of additive, while 20% molasses gave a greater deposit, with either formulation. Molasses, had an adverse effect on some properties of the spray mixtures, which resulted in lower deposits when spraying was done at high humidity in the laboratory. This effect was offset when spraying was done at lower humidity in the field, because molasses improved the impaction of droplets by increasing their density and by preventing the complete evaporation of small droplets.",NA

SC-0224 is the trimethylsulfonium (TMS) salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine (PMG), whereas glyphosate is commercially formulated as the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of PMG. Both formulated and technical grade forms of SC-0224 were found to be much more phytotoxic to duckweed then either formulated or technical grade forms of glyphosate. The growth inhibition caused by glyphosate was partially prevented by different combinations of the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp; whereas, the duckweed growth inhibition caused by SC-0224 could not be reduced by the same amino acid combinations. Trimethylsulfonium ion (TMS), the cationic constituent of the SC-0224 salt, and SC-0224 were found to be equally phytotoxic to duckweed indicating that the phytotoxic effects of TMS may be responsible for differences in the action of glyphosate and SC-0224 on duckweed. SC-0224 and glyphosate equally inhibited the production of anthranilate in the cell-free extract of K. pneumoniae, whereas TMS caused no inhibition.

The internationally-agreed CIPAC MT 36.2 test depends upon the determination of the shift in bulk concentration between the upper and lower halves of an emulsion after a period of standing. An analytical method specific to the active ingredient is stipulated. This paper reports an investigation of the use of CIPAC MT 36.2 with an emulsifiable concentrate (EC)-soluble dye which allows a colorimetric finish. This new method should be applicable to almost all ECs, and uses less costly instrumentation than the standard method. It could therefore allow more convenient use of CIPAC MT 36.2 for formulation development purposes. The limitations and range of applicability of the new method are discussed. For ECs of poor spontaneity it is shown that emulsion stability is strongly influenced by the emulsification technique used. Techniques within the frame of CIPAC MT 36.2 have been discovered which give repeatable results for such ECs.",NA

This activity was increased with the period of dark incubation and was not altered with heat treatment or pH change, but was obviously affected by treatment with surfactants. Accordingly, protoporphyrin IX, which was identified as the active substance, was assumed to be accumulated in the membrane structure during diphenyl ether herbicide pretreatment. On examination of the effects on tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, diphenyl ether herbicides seemed not to inhibit Mg chelatase activity but stimulated 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthesizing system activities in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. Okuji). This result suggested that diphenyl ether herbicides stimulate ALA-synthesizing system and cause the accumulation of tetrapyrroles in plant cells, and that tetrapyrrole-sensitized photooxidation disrupts membranes, causing cell death.

Untreated workers as well as treated ones died (or became moribund) in the presence of workers or soldiers that had been sprayed with a water-diluted microcapsule solution, indicating the transmission of poison between individuals. In all conditions, soldiers showed much less sensitivity to the microcapsule formulation than workers. Self and mutual-grooming by workers was noted to be critical to microcapsule efficacy, resulting in the transmission of insecticide from poison-donors (insecticide-contaminated individuals) to poison-recipients (workers). Bioassay of microcapsule-treated soil for the efficacy against mouth-obturated and deantennated workers showed that poisoning of workers was delayed compared with that of unoperated ones. This result supports the assumption of the importance of transmission in the poisoning process. The basis of the transmission of the present fenitrothion microcapsule among termite workers is dependent on adhesion of microcapsules to the appendages, especially to the antennae, followed by self-and mutual-grooming. Grooming results in the breakage of microcapsules and oral intake of the active ingredient of the formulation by the groomers, as well as dermal intake by those that are groomed.",NA

In addition, technical grade alachlor, metribuzin, propachlor, and triallate were tested for comparison with the formulated herbicides. The relative toxicity of the commercial formulations, based on percent active ingredient, varied considerably. The EC50 values ranged from 1.23 mg/L for Fargo to 5,600 mg/L for Rodeo. Fargo, ME4 Brominal, and Ramrod were moderately toxic to midge larvae; Lasso, Sutan (+), and Eradicane were slightly toxic; and Sencor and Rodeo were practically non-toxic. The 48-hr EC50 values of the two surfactants were nearly identical and were considered moderately toxic to midges. For two of the herbicides in which the technical grade material was tested, the inert ingredients in the formulations had a significant effect on the toxicity of the active ingredients. Fargo was twice as toxic as technical grade triallate, whereas Sencor was considerably less toxic than technical grade metribuzin. A comparison of the slope function values indicated that the toxic action of all the compounds occurred within a relatively narrow range. Published acute toxicity data on these compounds for other freshwater biota were tabulated and compared with our results. In general, the relative order of toxicity to C. riparius was similar to those for other freshwater invertebrates and fish. Maximum concentrations of each herbicide in bulk runoff during a projected ""critical"" runoff event were calculated as a percentage of the application rate lost in a given volume of runoff.

Following oral administration blood levels peaked at 2-3 h and declined to undetectable levels within 48 h; more than 80% of the dose was found as unchanged triclopyr in the urine. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to describe the time-course of triclopyr clearance; half-lives for the rapid initial and slower terminal phases were 1.3 h and 5.1 h respectively, and were independent of dose. Due to the slow half-life for determal absorption (t1/2 = 16.8 h) the rapid initial elimination phase was obscured and the pharmacokinetics could be simplified by a one-compartment model. An average of 1.37% of the applied dose was recovered in the urine; when corrected for recovery after oral administration this was equivalent to an absorption of 1.65%.

The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spray applications in cereal crops once or twice per growing season at a maximum seasonal rate of 30 g as/ha for spring applications, or 15 g as/ha for autumn applications. Due to the fact that the methyl ester, a variant of tribenuron, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant tribenuron-methyl, unless otherwise specified. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Tribenuron-methyl was extensively and rapidly metabolised (mainly via urine) in rats via multiple pathways resulting in many metabolites. Tribenuron-methyl had a low acute toxicity, but showed sensitising properties and a label with the risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed. The lowest NOAEL found in the short term studies was 7 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 (100 ppm) from the rat 90- day study, based on effects of tribenuron-methyl on body weight changes. Tribenuron-methyl was not genotoxic in any of the tests conducted. Tribenuron-methyl was not considered as toxic for reproduction. The lowest NOAEL was proposed at 7 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 and based on body weight changes. The rat was the most sensitive species when tested for chronic toxicity leading to a lowest proposed NOAEL of 1 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 seen in the 2-year rat study based on effects on the body weights. The proposed ADI is 0.01 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 based on effects on the body weight changes in the 2-year rat study and applying a 100-fold assessment factor. The proposed AOEL is 0.07 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 based on body weight changes in the 90 day rat study and applying a 100-fold assessment factor. The ARfD for tribenuron-methyl should be 0.2 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 based on the NOAEL of 20 mg kg(-1) bw day-1 based on effect on implantation in the rabbit developmental study with a 100-fold assessment factor. The outcome of the risk assessment for operators showed acceptable use of tribenuron-methyl 75WG in field crop scenario with a tractor mounted hydraulic boom under the studied conditions without the use of personal protection equipment (PPE). The expert meeting (May 2004) agreed that workers and bystanders exposure estimates were acceptable (< 1% AOEL). The metabolism of tribenuron-methyl in cereals is extensive and does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern. No residues of tribenuron-methyl were quantified in any of the cereal grain or straw samples from field trials conducted according critical GAP. Using a residue level equal to the LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg for grain in the chronic dietary risk assessment and the short term exposure risk assessment represents a worst-case scenario and leads to estimated intakes for consumers that are significantly below (less than 1 %) of the proposed ADI and ARfD. Persistence of tribenuron-methyl in the main environmental compartments (soil and water) is generally low or moderate. Three major aerobic metabolites have been identified and assessed in soil. One additional major metabolite appears under anaerobic conditions. Three major metabolites were identified in the water/sediment system and assessed for potential surface water or sediment contamination, assuming drift as the main loading route. Member States may need to consider the contribution of drainage and run-off. Tribenuron-methyl was found to be relevant as a potential groundwater contaminant. The trigger of 0.1 mu g/L was exceeded for five of the nine scenarios with a maximum of 0.47 mu g/L for the Piacenza scenario under alkaline ( pH > 7) conditions and autumn application. However, the trigger was not exceeded for any of the scenarios when non alkaline soils were simulated. Therefore, Member States should take into account that tribenuron-methyl may show a potential for reaching groundwater concentrations > 0.1 mu g/L in vulnerable situations. Exposure in the compartment air is expected to be negligible. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, soil micro-and macro-organisms, including earthworms is low with respect to tribenuron-methyl and the metabolites as far as investigated. High risks were identified for terrestrial plants and higher aquatic plants being the most sensitive aquatic organism, which require consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trifluralin,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.28r,"Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""EF-1521"" (""Treflan""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. In case of oilseed rape, sunflowers, cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised and absorbed. It has a low acute toxicity, but has sensitising properties (proposed classification: R43). Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects were seen in rats such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours and renal carcinoma (proposed classification: R40). A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be established but the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat was assigned as the most relevant effect level. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day and no acute reference dose (ARfD) was allocated. The estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn both during mixing/loading and during application. The metabolism of trifluralin in cereals is extensive and does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern. No residues of trifluralin were quantified in any of the cereal grain or straw samples from field trials conducted according the critical good agricultural practise (GAP) in Northern Europe. Further information is needed to conclude on the residue situation in cereals for Southern European uses. For oilseed crops the present studies do not fully address consumer exposure via seeds. Therefore a further metabolism study is required for oilseeds to support uses on these crops. Subsequently the applicability of the submitted residue trials in oilseed crops has to be reviewed. Due to the above mentioned requirements a final conclusion on the livestock dietary burden and on the possibly occurrence of residues in food of animal origin cannot be drawn at this stage. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the currently available information in line with the Northern European GAP on cereals leads to estimated intakes less than 4% of the proposed ADI for the consumer subgroups of infants and young children. However, this assessment needs to be reviewed upon receipt of the outstanding data. An ARfD was not allocated, thus there is no acute risk for consumers arising from trifluralin residues in food. In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-43 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-144 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the Peer Review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14. Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half-lives between 81 to 356 d at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing TR-65 and TR-156 metabolites. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the Peer Review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 d should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion and that a DT50 = 2 d could be used to refine risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study conducted in the presence of light that could be used by MS to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g / L under the proposed conditions of use. Trifluralin was designated as a ""priority substance"" under the Water Framework Directive7 but has not been identified as a ""priority hazardous substance"". However, trifluralin has been added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002 because it is considered to be a PBT substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity. Because of its high volatility the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport trough air is possible. However, photochemical half life in air is estimated to be short. The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms, including earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated. High risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk to fish, which require consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TER-value of approximately 1). Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. The EPCO expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm eating birds and mammals should be considered further at MS-level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA proposes that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement has not been discussed in an EPCO expert meeting The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate endpoint (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account. Regulation (EC) No 850/20048 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC9 entered into force when the Peer Review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, EFSA's conclusion does not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(10). However, available information assessed during the Peer Review and provided in this conclusion should allow the Commission and the Member States to conduct the assessment of trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. As this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tolylfluanid,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.29r,"Tolylfluanid is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tolylfluanid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 30 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer AG. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 12 March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 9 February 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a foliar fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises spray treatment to foliar to control a wide range of fungicidal diseases such as apple scab, grey mould, leaf spot diseases and powdery and downy mildew in different fruits, vegetables and hops at application rate up 3 kg tolylfluanid per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "" Euparen M WG 50"", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered in almost all Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition apart from food of animal origin. Tolylfluanid is extensively and rapidly absorbed (> 90%). Oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, toxicity during inhalation exposure was low to high which was related to the particle size leading to a differentiated proposal for classification i.e. tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m (T+; R26). Tolylfluanid has irritating properties in both eyes and skin (proposed classification: Xi; R36/37/38) and has sensitizing properties (proposed classification: R43). Main effects during short term oral exposure were functional disturbance of the thyroid, increased liver weights and decreased liver enzyme levels in the rat and dog and slight histopathological changes in the kidney in the dog at high dose levels. During inhalation exposure severe respiratory tract irritation including deaths was observed. Depending on the particle size, tolylfluanid containing >= 0.1% particles < 50 mu m is classified as toxic (proposed classification: T, R48/R23). Tolylfluanid is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. There were no effects on reproductive or developmental toxicity observed and no evidence of neurotoxicity was observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set to 0.1 mg/kg, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) to 0.3 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) to 0.25 mg/kg bw/day. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL for proposed uses of Euparen M 50 WG. The metabolism of tolylfluanid in plants proceeds through degradation to DMST3, being the main metabolite in the majority of investigated crops. Moreover, under processing conditions tolylfluanid degrades rapidly and almost completely to DMST, that has a similar toxicity compared to tolylfluanid. The residue situation in food of plant origin was proved with a sufficient number of trials according to the critical GAP for a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops and for hops; and also with studies determining the level of residues in processed products. In livestock tolylfluanid is rapidly metabolised to DMST that was detected in all organs and tissues as well as in eggs. Assuming fruit pomace as the only relevant feed item possibly containing residues from tolylfluanid treatment, no quantifiable residues are expected in edible products of animal origin. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessment for adult consumers indicates that the intake of residues via the total diet for food of plant origin or any individual food item considered does not exceed the ADI and the ARfD, respectively. For toddlers and children the theoretical maximum daily residue intake from fruit and vegetables (TMDI) occupies no more than 70% of the ADI, indicating that long-term exposure to residues from tolylfluanid treated crops does not pose an adverse health risk to these consumer subgroups. The estimation of the short term exposure revealed that the ARfD is slightly exceeded (102%, WHO/GEMS Food data) for children consuming table grapes. However, Germany pointed out during the last discussion of tolylfluanid that a greater exceedance of the ARfD (121%) was obtained based on national consumption data for children. Under aerobic conditions, tolylfluanid yields DMST that is subsequently degraded to other minor metabolites (none > 10 % AR) and ultimately bound residue and CO2. Photolysis will not significantly contribute to the overall degradation of tolylfluanid under environmental conditions. Tolylfluanid is between very low to low persistent in soil and metabolite DMST is low persistent. Tolylfluanid should be classified as a slightly to low mobile compound and DMST can be classified as a medium to high mobile compound. Hydrolysis of tolylfluanid is rapid and slightly pH dependent. DMST is stable in all range of environmental relevant pH. Direct photodegradation is not expected to contribute to the degradation of tolylfluanid or its metabolite DMST in the aqueous environment. Tolylfluanid is not ready biodegradable. In water sediment systems, tolylfluanid completely disappear from water phase in about three days mainly due to degradation. Levels of tolylfluanid found in the sediment never attained the 10 % of AR. Major metabolite, both in water and sediment, was DMST. DMST dissipates from the water phase by degradation and adsorption to the sediment. On the basis of FOCUS-PELMO model simulations neither tolylfluanid nor DMST are expected to exceed the 0.1 mu g /L trigger in ground water. The risk to birds, bees, soil micro-and macro-organisms, including earthworms and non-target terrestrial plants is low with respect to tolylfluanid and the metabolites as far as investigated. A high long term risk to mammals was identified. The toxicity exposure ratio (TER) values range from 0.84 to 2.78 depending on the representative use evaluated and therefore breaching the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all the representative uses evaluated. Further data to address this risk is needed and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. High risk is identified for fish (being the most sensitive aquatic organism), which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Pending on the representative use, bufferzones of 5-20 metres are needed to respect the Annex VI trigger value. The toxicity to fish is higher at lower pH-values therefore it is proposed that Member States with surface water bodies of low pH (< 6) associated with agricultural landscapes should consider the effect of pH on toxicity to fish at the local level. Also for non-target arthropods (other than bees) a high risk was identified in-field however a recovery before the start of next season is considered possible.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance glufosinate,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.27r,"Glufosinate is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on glufosinate in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 January 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 April 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to a full consensus on all issues and the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of 3 representative uses as proposed by the notifier, representing the 3 main types of use of the compound (apple for non-selective herbicide use in conventional crops, potatoes for use as crop desiccant and transgenic maize for use as selective herbicide) at application rate up 1.5 kg glufosinate-ammonium per hectare. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Basta SL 14"", ""Basta SL 18"" and ""Liberty SL 18"", soluble concentrates (SL). The latter can be used in genetically modified glufosinate tolerant organisms (such as maize, oil seed rape and sugar beets). Due to the fact that the ammonium salt, a variant of glufosinate, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant glufosinate-ammonium, unless otherwise specified. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for blood. Glufosinate-ammonium is poorly absorbed; the average was set to 10% (based on available data). The major metabolites were MPP3 and NAG(4), minor amounts of MHB5, MPB6 and traces of MPA(7). The oral LD50 was 1510 mg/kg bw in the rat and 416 mg/kg bw in the mouse (leading to a proposed classification with Xn; R22). Dermal LD50 was determined > 4000 mg/kg bw for the rat < 2000 mg/kg bw for the female rabbit and > 2000 mg/kg bw for the male rabbit. According to the inhalatory LC50 1.26 mg/l air a classification of Xn; R20 was proposed. Glufosinate-ammonium was mildly irritating to eyes but not to skin and showed no sensitising properties. Relevant oral short term no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) is 4.5 mg/kg bw/day, 1-year dog study, based on mortality and decreased glutamine synthetase activity and is an overall value for the studies in dog (proposed classification: Xn; R48/22). Relevant dermal NOAEL is 100 and 300 mg/kg bw/day for male and female rat, respectively. The NOAEL(C) was 0.012 mg/l air leading to a proposed classification of T; R48/23. There was no evidence of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity or direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed. The relevant NOAEL for reproduction is 120 ppm (7.5 and 9.6 mg/kg bw/day male and female) in rat based on reduced litter size. However, both pre-and post implantation losses to a high degree were noted and the NOAEL was set to 50 ppm (4.3 mg/kg bw/day). Glufosinate-ammonium induced pre-and post implantation losses, vaginal bleedings, abortions and dead foetuses not induced by maternal toxicity. The relevant developmental NOAEL is 6.3 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit based on premature deliveries, abortions and dead foetuses (proposed classification: Cat. 2, T; R61/R62). No indications of delayed neurotoxicity. The metabolites (NAG, MPA and MPP) are all less toxic than glufosinate-ammonium. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) are based on the NOAEL of 6.3 mg/kg bw/day from the rabbit developmental toxicity study. Due to the severe art of effects seen both in the rat and rabbit an additional safety factor of 3 was added. The ADI is 0.021 mg/kg bw/day. The AOEL is 0.0021 mg/kg bw/day since a correction for 10% oral absorption (based on available data) is required. Two acute reference doses (ARfD) values are set; the first is based on the NOAEL from the rabbit developmental study for women of child bearing potential i.e. 0.021 mg/kg bw/day. The second is based on the NOAEL of 4.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year dog study, without additional safety factor, i.e. 0.045 mg/kg bw/day is suggested to be used for the general population. Dermal absorption of the formulations Basta SL14 and Basta SL18/ Liberty SL18 were 16 % and 7 % for undiluted product and 14 % and 9 % for spraying dilution, respectively. The estimated operator exposure levels for apple orchards using Basta SL14/ SL18 were below the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) was used. The estimated operator exposure both for potato desiccation using Basta SL14/ SL18 and for weed control in transgenic maize using Liberty SL18 exceeded the AOEL even when PPE was used. The metabolism of glufosinate-ammonium has been investigated on the three crops selected as representative uses by the notifier as well as in livestock. The residue definition proposed for monitoring and risk assessment for apples, potatoes and transgenic maize as well as for products of animal origin is the sum of glufosinate, its salts, MPP and NAG expressed as glufosinate equivalents. This definition protects adequately the consumer. When the product is used according to the proposed good agricultural practice in apple and maize, no residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1 mg/ kg are present at harvest. In potatoes, however, residues can be present up to 0.5 mg/ kg and consist essentially of parent glufosinate. These residues are not altered by cooking in boiling water. In a succeeding crop installed shortly after the use of glufosinate, one unknown metabolite of polar nature can be present but at extremely low levels (around 0.01 mg/ kg). Further work should however be done to identify this metabolite. Cattle liver and kidney can contain measurable levels of residues of MPP (up to 1 and 2 mg / kg respectively) when the animals are fed with potatoes and transgenic maize treated with glufosinate. Chronic and acute risk assessments for the consumers were carried out according to usual methodologies. Based on the available data, the use on potatoes appeared to lead to an acute risk for toddlers (114 % of the ARfD for general population, including toddlers). All studies on the fate and behaviour in the environment were performed with the ammonium salt of glufosinate (glufosinate-ammonium). Due to the fact the ammonium ion is ubiquitous in the environment; the fate of the ammonium resulting from the application of glufosinate-ammonium was not followed. Therefore, the results are referred to the fate of the anion glufosinate which is expected to be dissociated in aqueous media at environmentally relevant pH (5-9). Glufosinate yields the two major metabolites MPP and MPA in soil under dark aerobic conditions. Glufosinate is stable towards photolytical degradation in soil. Glufosinate is low persistent and metabolites MPP and MPA are low to moderate persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. Plant metabolite in transgenic plants, NAG, is very low persistent in soil. However, Member States may need to further assess this metabolite for uses were a larger portion of the plants is left in the field after cropping. Glufosinate is moderate to high mobile, MPP is high mobile and MPA is high to moderate mobile in soil. Glufosinate is hydrolytically stable and it is not degraded by photolysis in water. Glufosinate is not readily biodegradable. In the water phase, at 20 degrees C under aerobic conditions, the major metabolites were MPP, MPA, P-X, 8 P-Y-9 (= MPF) and NAG. The same metabolites were found under anaerobic conditions. Glufosinate reached levels above 10 % applied radioactivity (AR) in the sediment. An estimated theoretical maximum of 46 % AR was calculated for MPP in the sediment and used for calculation of the predicted environmental concentration in sediment (PEC sed). The dissipation half-lives of glufosinate in the water phase were 1.4 - 13 days at 20 degrees C. The half life for MPP was estimated by extrapolation to be 150 d. Degradation of MPA and P-Y was slower. Further assessement of metabolites NAG and P-X may be needed for MS risk assessement. Predicted environmental concentrations in surface water (PEC sw) and sediment (PEC sed) presented in the addendum were used for the ecotoxicological risk assessment. According FOCUS ground water (gw) PELMO 1.1.1. modelling MPP may have some potential to contaminate groundwater in vulnerable areas (trigger of 0.1 mu g /L is exceeded in one of the nine scenarios). One field leaching study confirms leaching potential of MPP under vulnerable conditions at levels above 0.1 mu g /L. Hence, for this metabolite an assessment with regard to potential relevance in ground water is warranted. Concentrations of glufosinate-ammonium in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to low volatility and short persistence in the atmosphere. Based on the data available at the EPCO expert meeting on ecotoxicology a high risk to mammals was identified. The acute and long term toxicity exposure ratio (TER) values are 3.5 and 0.13 respectively for the use in apples. The long term TER value is 0.86 in transgenic maize and the long term TER value for insectivorous mammals in potatoes would be 3.25 if the interception factor is disregarded as proposed by EFSA. Further data was submitted by the notifier after the EPCO expert meeting but this was neither evaluated by the RMS nor peer reviewed. The risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. The resulting TER-values for the acute and long term risk for aquatic organism were all higher than the Annex VI rigger value indicating a low risk to aquatic organisms for all representative uses (pending on a confirmatory data requirement for the long term risk to Daphnia magna from the metabolite MPP). The risk is considered to be low for in-field populations of non-target arthropods (NTA) in potato and transgenic maize. A high risk is identified for off-crop populations of non-target arthropods in potatoes and maize which requires risk mitigation measures such as a 5 m bufferzone at Member State level. The available data at the EPCO expert meeting were not sufficient to demonstrate a safe use for non-target arthropods in orchards, since the tested doses in the field study were lower than those recommended in orchards (1.5 kg as/ha) and the risk assessment can only be concluded when the outstanding data is evaluated. Based on the available data EFSA considers the risk to non-target plants from the use in orchards and maize as low when a buffer zone of 5 meter is taken into account. The risk from the use in potatoes can be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to birds, bees, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 1-methylcyclopropene,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.30r,"1-Methylcyclopropene is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 the United Kingdom received an application from Rohm and Haas for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/35/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on 1-methylcyclopropene, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 22 March 2003. EFSA received this document on 7 August 2003. The peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation to the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the draft assessment report were examined by the rapporteur Member State and discussed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further information made available by the notifier were evaluated in a scientific meeting with Member State experts in May 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 March 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator as proposed by the notifier which comprises room treatment via a gas supply generator used for the storage of apples at application rate up to 2.24 mg 1-methylcyclopropene per cubic meter or 0.009 mg per kg apple. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""smart fresh"", a water soluble powder, which release 1-MCP when dissolved in water (vapour releasing product, VP). For the purposes of this evaluation, 1-MCP is used as an abbreviation for 1-methylcyclopropene (IUPAC), but has no official status (not accepted by ISO). 1-MCP is a gas. At high concentrations, it is energetically self-reactive and becomes explosive if it is allowed to warm in a closed container. These properties present practical difficulties when conducting studies with 1-MCP. The active substance is never isolated in the manufacturing process for reasons of safety. Instead, 1-MCP is produced as an a-cyclodextrin complex, containing approximate to 3.3 % of 1-MCP. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. No analytical methods for the determination of residues in soil and water have been required, since 1methylcyclopropene is a gas and it is unlikely to reach these compartments. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed. A limited toxicology data set was submitted since 1-MCP is a gas at room temperature and it was only tested in inhalation studies, no studies on neurotoxicity, long term studies or reproductive toxicity were submitted. Ten percent of 1-MCP inhaled into the lungs on each breath was absorbed. 1-MCP is not acutely toxic. Based on available data 1-MCP gave negative results in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. However, two impurities, 1-chloro-2-methylpropene (1-CMP) and 3-chloro2- methylpropene (3-CMP), evident at a low concentration, are reported to give positive results in genotoxicity studies and are carcinogenic. Thus, a classification of 1-MCP as T; R46 is proposed. In the short-term toxicity studies, effects on red blood cells were observed. A developmental study was submitted and no effects were observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI), the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) for inhalation as well as the systemic AOEL was derived from the 90 day study in rats (NOAEL of 9 mg/kg bw/day). For the ADI, a 100 fold assessment factor, with an additional assessment factor of 10 in extrapolating from a short-term study to lifetime exposure as well as adjustment for 10% inhalatory absorption gives a total assessment factor of 10 000 resulting in an ADI of 0.0009 mg/kg bw/day. The inhalation AOEL is 0.09 mg/kg bw/day with and the systemic AOEL is 0.009 mg/kg bw/day with adjustment for 10 % inhalatory absorption. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.07 mg/kg bw/day. On the basis of field measurements, a treated store contains a maximum possible air concentration of 1-MCP (1.0 ppm). The maximum concentration of 1-MCP in air would contain a maximum combined concentration of < 0.05 ppm of toxicologically significant impurities. The estimated operator exposure is < 1% of the systemic AOEL. Worker exposure is estimated to be < 2% of the inhalatory AOEL and bystander exposure is negligible. The metabolism of 1-MCP following application on plant commodities was not investigated, as based on the representative GAP on apples a theoretical maximum residue level was calculated as 0.009 mg/kg from the amount of active ingredient applied to a given weight of apples at the maximum proposed concentration. From a residue study with radiolabelled 1-MCP it became evident that total residues on apples will in fact hardly ever exceed 50 % of the theoretical calculated level. Thus, the level of potential metabolites present is deemed insignificant. Moreover their nature would be not identifiable at these low levels. The dietary risk assessment for consumers demonstrated that intakes are less than 1% of the ADI and the ARfD, respectively, for all considered population subgroups except for children of 1-4 years of age. For the latter group, the national estimate of daily intake calculated using the UK model was 14% of the ADI. Use of 1-MCP will be restricted to indoor use in post-harvest storage. Therefore, contamination of natural soils, surface and ground waters may be precluded. Studies to investigate the fate of 1-MCP in these compartments are not required. The active ingredient 1-MCP is a gas under environmental relevant conditions. Emission from a Controlled Atmosphere Facility (CAF) through ventilation after the treatment processes may not be precluded. However, concentrations expected in open air as a consequence venting storage facilities will be low and unlikely to persist. The risk to birds, mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, soil micro-and macroorganisms, including earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is low with respect to 1-MCP as far as investigated.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.46r,"Dimoxystrobin is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 the United Kingdom received an application from BASF for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2002/593/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and EFSA for EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the completeness of the dossier had been officially confirmed after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom submitted the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on dimoxystrobin, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), to the EFSA on 17 July 2003. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 14 August 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 20 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises spraying using ground base equipment to control fungal pathogens in winter wheat at application rate up to 200 g dimoxystrobin per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""BAS 50700 F"", a suspension concentrate (SC), which contains as a second active substance epoxiconazole (a substance to be evaluated at stage 3, part A of the review programme under Directive 91/414/EEC). Dimoxystrobin can be used only as fungicide. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of dimoxystrobin. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. With respect to mammalian toxicology dimoxystrobin is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed. Dimoxystrobin is extensively metabolised to a large number of metabolites. The oral and dermal toxicity is low. However, it is harmful during inhalation, and the classification of Xn; R20 ""Harmful by inhalation"" is proposed. No repeated inhalation study is available. Thickening of the duodenum was the main effect observed in rats and mice. There was no evidence of genotoxicity. Dimoxystrobin was carcinogenic in mice causing an increased incidence of adenoma and adenomacarcinoma in the duodenum at the top dose. There was also focal hyperplasia in the duodenum at the top dose, interpreted as a pre-neoplastic lesion. Based on the results, the risk phrase and classification Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" is proposed. There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed up to the highest dose level. There were no indications for dimoxystrobin being neurotoxic. The metabolites 505M083 and 505M094 were considered toxicologically relevant, due to the structural similarity with dimoxystrobin. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 1000) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 200). The formulation, BAS 507 OOF, contains two active ingredients dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole. The studies were not performed on the representative formulation BAS 507 OOF but on dimoxystrobin diluted in a solvent formulation with a similar composition of the non-active co-formulants in BAS 507 OOF, an ""artificial BAS 507 OOF"". The dermal absorption value was proposed to be 1% for both undiluted and diluted formulation. For epoxiconazole the rapporteur Member State proposed 10%. As the representative formulation contains two active substances the operator exposure follows a combined approach. The rapporteur Member State presented a risk assessment for each of the two active substances. For dimoxystrobin, the risk assessment is based on dimoxystrobin in the ""artificial formulation BAS 507 OOF"". The risk assessment for epoxiconazole, is based on the assumptions and proposals of the rapporteur Member State. Since epoxiconazole has not yet been evaluated, but will be in the stage 3 part A of the review programme and the studies have not been peer reviewed and none of the values has been agreed on, all values should be regarded as provisional until agreed on. The proposed risk assessment is only valid when the toxicological assessment for epoxiconazole has been agreed on later in the process and thus the risk assessment of BAS 507 OOF can not be regarded as complete, but only indicative. The risk assessment for epoxiconazole is based on the estimated exposure calculated of the formulation Opus. The estimated exposure for dimoxystrobin is below the AOEL (13%) without any PPE in the ""artificial BAS 507 OOF"". The estimated operator exposure for epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (48%) and with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (30%). If, all values are agreed on and if the actual exposure should be identified as being additive, then it might be assumed that the estimated combined exposure of dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole is below the AOEL in the German model without PPE (61%) or with PPE during both mixing and loading as well as during application according to the UK POEM (45%) for both dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole. Applied to wheat plants by foliar application dimoxystrobin itself was the major residue found at harvest in straw and in grain accounting for about 90% and 60% of the total residue, respectively. Total levels of radioactivity in grain were too low to allow further characterization of metabolites. Dimoxystrobin turned out to be persistent in soil and hence it was present in rotational crops at plant back intervals up to 365 days. However, significant residues (>0.01 mg/kg) of dimoxystrobin or other metabolites in plant parts for human consumption are not anticipated from crop rotation. Fed to ruminants and poultry, dimoxystrobin was intensively metabolised resulting in a comparable pattern to that observed in rat metabolism, with the exception of metabolite 505M765, which was not specifically found in the rat. Despite the lipophilic character of dimoxystrobin there was no indication of accumulation in the body fat of the tested animal species. In a feeding study levels of relevant compounds (dimoxystrobin, metabolites 505M09 and 505M76) in edible animal matrices were all found to be below the respective LOQ. The assessment of chronic dietary exposure of consumers to dimoxystrobin residues based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that the most highly exposed consumer subgroup was infants at 83% of the proposed ADI. The short term exposure of all considered consumer subgroups from individual commodities, based on consumption data of UK consumers, were well within the proposed ARfD, accounting for up to 48% ARfD at a maximum from the consumption of milk by toddlers. Since there were relevant metabolites found in ground water, a consumer risk assessment was performed, considering the sum of possible intakes of dimoxystrobin and the metabolites 505M09 and 505M76 from drinking water in addition to the intake through diet. The total intakes from diet and drinking were demonstrated to be below the ADI of dimoxystrobin for the considered consumer subgroups. The degradation of dimoxystrobin in soil is initiated by the oxidation of methyl moieties of the phenyl ring. Metabolite 505M09 attained levels above 10 % AR in laboratory experiments and metabolite 505M08 was found at levels above 10 % of the applied parent in field trials. Maximum mineralization after 120 d was between negligible to 24 % AR. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 24 % after 120 d. A major photolysis metabolite 505M016 is identified in the soil photolysis study. Dimoxystrobin is medium to high persistent (DT50 = 88 401 d) in soil at 20 C. Metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 are less persistent in soil than parent compound. Dimoxystrobin is not degraded under anaerobic conditions. Degradation of dimoxystrobin is enhanced under irradiated conditions. Three field dissipation studies were performed in Germany, two in Spain and two in Sweden. Dimoxystrobin shows to be moderate to high persistent in field (DT5o (200c, pF2) = 57.6-131.6 d). Accumulation of dimoxystrobin in soil was investigated under field conditions in two trials in S.W. Germany, following repeated annual application to cereals over three years. Standard PEC soil (0 100 d) were calculated for parent and metabolite 505M01. Worst case maximum amount PEC soil for metabolite 505M01 was calculated assuming 100 % transformation from parent dimoxystrobin. The PEC soil for 505M09 values were calculated with a five compartmental model. No PEC soil was calculated for metabolite 505M08. In the RMS calculation of potential accumulation, maximum plateau concentration was reached after 5 years (PEC soil acc = 0.046 mg/kg). Residues seen in the field accumulation trials were considered to be mostly in the range of predicted concentrations. According batch equilibrium adsorption/desorption studies dimoxystrobin may be classified as low to medium mobile in soil, 505M01 as very high mobile, 505M08 as high to very high mobile and 505M09 as high to very high mobile. Dimoxystrobin is stable to hydrolysis at all environmental relevant pHs. Photolysis may moderately contribute to the degradation of dimoxystrobin in water. Degradation of dimoxystrobin in water/sediment systems was very limited. Only 10-15 % of the applied dimoxystrobin degrades after 100 d. Disappearance from the water phase is mainly attributed to partition with sediment. Additionally an outdoor water sediment study and an outdoor mesocosm study in Germany were used to investigate the aquatic dissipation of dimoxystrobin. Photolysis and partition to sediment were considered the main routes of dissipation of dimoxystrobin from the water phase in the outdoor water sediment study. In the mesocosm study dimoxystrobin was applied in early May and a dissipation DT50 = 60 69 d was calculated for the water phase. Only initial spray drift PECsw values were used in the surface water risk assessment presented by the RMS in the DAR. Other potential routes of surface water contamination such as run off and drainage are partially addressed in the DAR following published (run-off) and national RMS scheme (drainflow) but were not used further for the EU risk assessment. FOCUSsw calculations were not presented. In the opinion of EFSA's Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) related to the evaluation of dimoxystrobin7, the PPR Panel used the DT50 = 63.5 d from the outdoor pond mesocosm study, as conservative but realistic value for the exposure assessment. In this opinion it is highlighted that a single exposure event applies only to exposure via the initial spray drift. Any other exposure routes as runoff and drain flow are not covered by RMS assessment. The PPR Panel noted that FOCUSsw simulations predict higher PEC values (0.15 - 3.64 lag / L) than those calculated in the DAR (1.85 lag / L) due to the fact that drainage and runoff were the major contributors to the surface water contamination for some of the selected scenarios. A comprehensive assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and effectiveness of potential mitigation measures to reduce surface water contamination is necessary to finalize the EU risk assessment. Concentrations of dimoxystrobin and its soil metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 in groundwater predicted with FOCUSgw for the representative uses proposed were below 0.1 lag / L trigger. However, in an outdoor lysimeter study in Germany exceedance of yearly average 0.1 lag / L trigger in the leachate was observed for metabolites 505M08 and 505M09 for all three years and in all the systems studied. By comparison of modelling and lysimeter results it was concluded that high interception was needed to reduce the potential of ground water contamination and that FOCUS modelling only covers risk assessment for application to late growth stages (crop interception 90 % or greater). Potential for groundwater contamination by 505M08 and 505M09 under vulnerable conditions needs to be assessed at MS level. The concentration of the photodegradation product 505M01 are below the 0.1 [tg/L trigger when calculated form the results of the lysimeter study. Concentration of dimoxystrobin in air is expected to be negligible due to low volatility and short half life in air for reaction with OH radicals. For birds and mammals EFSA provided a risk assessment according to the latest guidance document (Sanco/4145/2000 of 25 September 2002) in an addendum which however was not yet peer reviewed. The risk assessment for dimoxystrobin (technical) resulted in TER values for the acute, short term and long term risk to insectivorous birds and mammals which met the Annex VI trigger values. However, the complete risk assessment for birds and the long term risk assessment for mammals is based on the endpoints deriving from studies with the technical active substance. Since the lead formulation contains a second active substance (epoxiconazole, listed for the 3rd stage of the peer review process) it is questionable whether it is possible to extrapolate from the toxicity of the technical active substance to the formulated product. Furthermore, the acute toxicity studies with rats showed that the formulated active substance in the lead formulation is more acutely toxic than the technical active substance. A high risk was identified for birds and mammals from the uptake of contaminated drinking water in a first tier risk assessment. EFSA is of the opinion that a high risk to birds and mammals from the application of the lead formulation cannot be excluded and additional data are required to address the risk of the lead formulation to birds and mammals. A high risk was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all tested groups of aquatic organisms. The higher tier risk assessment for fish resulted in TER values which met the revised acute TER trigger value. No agreement was reached in the EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 3) if the chronic risk assessment should be based on the endpoints deriving from the early life stage (ELS) test with rainbow trout (flow through test design) or on the ELS test with golden orfe (single application and presence of sediment). Therefore, this question was forwarded to the Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues. The PPR Panel concluded that the endpoint of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) should be used. Based on this endpoint (overall NOEC of 0.316 a.s./L) a high risk was calculated in the addendum provided by EFSA which was not peer reviewed. Therefore the high chronic risk to fish needs to be addressed with further data. A mesocosm study was conducted as a higher tier test to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae. In the EPCO experts' meeting (EPCO 3) it was agreed that a safety factor of 5 has to be applied to the TER value of 2.7 deriving from the mesocosm study. Consequently a high risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae was identified and has to be addressed with further data and risk mitigation measures are necessary. Field studies with earthworms were conducted because a high long term risk to earthworms was identified in a first tier risk assessment. The results of the field studies led to the conclusion that the long term risk to earthworms is low. The risk to bees, non target arthropods, soil macro-, soil micro-organisms, non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. The risk from the metabolites 505M01, 505M08, 505M09 to the environment is low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.46r/full,"Pirimicarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pirimicarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 December 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprises broadcast spraying to control aphids in wheat at application rate up 0.21 kg pirimicarb per hectare. Pirimicarb can be used only as insecticide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Pirimor"" (""YF7904B""), a water dispersible granule (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective finalised residue definition. Only single methods for determine of residues are available since a multi-residue method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Mammalian toxicity during oral and inhalatory exposure is high and pirimicarb is a skin sensitizer, proposal for classification is T; R23/25 ""Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". Main effects observed during short term exposure were reduction in cholinesterase activity and haematological effects. Due to the consistent effects on haematological parameters at relatively low dose levels throughout the studies the proposal for classification is R48/22 ""Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged oral exposure"" There is no genotoxic potential for pirimicarb. However, in the mouse indications of a possible increase of pulmonary tumours were observed which were outside the upper historical control range. The experts' meeting could not come to an agreement whether on classification was required or not. Therefore, a question mark is added to the risk phrase and Xn; R40? is proposed ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity nor neurotoxicity was observed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.035 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw, the safety factor of 100 is used. The estimated operator exposure according to the German model is below the AOEL without PPE. According to the UK-POEM gloves and respiratory personal equipment (RPE) is needed during mixing and loading and coveralls and gloves when handling contaminated surfaces. Thus, it would be appropriate to include the use of gloves and RPE due to the sensitizing properties of pirimicarb and due to the fact that it is toxic during acute oral and inhalation exposure. The metabolism of pirimicarb has been studied on wheat and supportive information was provided for 3 other crops. The residues of concern in wheat were found to be pirimicarb itself and 2 carbamate metabolites with similar or higher level of toxicity, R348363 and R348854. In other crops, another metabolite, R351405 was also present. For the use on grain, the proposed residue definition (sum of pirimicarb, R34836 and R34885 expressed as pirimicarb) for monitoring is efficient to protect adequately the safety of the consumers. No concern was identified for rotational and succeeding crops. The metabolism of pirimicarb in ruminant and poultry is extensive and the use of pirimicarb in wheat does not lead to the presence of the active substance or its carbamate metabolites in edible animal tissues. A residue definition consisting of pirimicarb only in animal tissues is proposed, although the monitoring of this compound when used under the proposed representative use does not provide value in term of consumer safety. The intake calculations for acute and long term exposures do not show any concern for the safety of the consumer. Under aerobic conditions, transformations of pirimicarb in soil yields the major metabolites R34885, R318056 and R348657. Metabolite R34836 does not reaches the 10 % AR in soil but was considered relevant because contains the intact carbamate toxophore. Mineralization of pirimicarb was low and unextractable residues accounted for a maximum of 14.9 % AR after 84 d. Under dark anaerobic conditions only metabolite R31805 was found at amounts above 10 % AR. Photolysis in soil may contribute to the environmental degradation of pirimicarb. Metabolite R34836 was the only photoproducts found at amounts above 10 % AR. Dissipation of pirimicarb under field conditions was investigated in two field studies in California (USA) and Germany (EU). In the California field study the metabolite R35140 containing the carbamate moiety was identified at average levels of 1.98 % of applied amount. Due to the fact that it contains the carbamate moiety it is considered as a relevant metabolite for soil compartment. Pirimicarb is medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 20 degrees C FMOC = 29 143 d). After the experts' meeting on fate and behaviour in the environment (EPCO 12, September 2004), RMS received an evaluation document from one MS summarizing the results of three laboratory degradation studies performed in the 1970s that was included in Addendum 4 to the DAR (December 2004). Since the original reports are still not available for evaluation these results are not considered in this conclusion and the confirmatory data requirement is maintained for these studies. It is the opinion of the RMS that, according the summary available to them, the trend for longer DT50 at lower pH is not fully consistent and that no evidence of pH effects are observed in the aqueous hydrolysis study (pirimicarb stable at pH 5-9). However, at least degradation in an additional soil would be necessary to fulfil data requirement as given in 91/414/EEC Annex II 7.1.1.2.1. since studies in only three soils are available. Experts meeting considered that field studies may qualitatively indicate a shorter persistence in field under bare soil conditions but no reliable DT50 may be obtained from them. Therefore, if the studies to be submitted with respect to the data requirement set by the evaluation meeting (see above) are finally not found acceptable to cover this data gap new data may need to be generated and provided. Metabolite R34836 is low to medium persistent (DT50 20 degrees C = 7 d - 90 d), R31805 is moderately persistent (DT50 20 inverted perpendicular degrees C = 33 d 38 d) and R34865 is moderate to medium persistent (DT5020 degrees C = 37 d 78 d). Metabolite R34885 appears to be moderately persistent in soil (DT50 20 degrees C = 14 d 31 d). Photolysis in soil may contribute to pirimicarb dissipation according laboratory soil photolysis. Initially, RMS used field half life to calculate PEC soil. The experts meetings did not accept this because field studies were performed in bare soil and representative uses imply application to fully developed crops. The contribution of photolysis may have been overestimated in the bare soil studies with respect to the lower irradiation in the cropped field. Therefore, worst case laboratory DT50 = 150 d was agreed for PEC soil calculations. New PEC soil calculations may be found in the Addendum to the DAR (December 2004). The results of batch adsorption/desorption studies indicate that pirimicarb is low to high mobile, R34836 could be classified as slightly to very high mobile, R34885 low to high mobile R31805 immobile to high mobile and R34865 immobile to medium mobile. R31805 appears to present stronger adsorption in more acidic soils. Experts meeting considered that a dependence of the Kf0, values on the soil clay content could be deduced and may need to be considered by MS in their assessments. Pyrimicarb was found to be stable to hydrolysis at environmental relevant pH 5 to 9. Photochemical degradation of pirimicarb in water under mid-European conditions is relatively rapid. Three major photochemical metabolites were identified: R34885, R31805 and R16210(8). Experts meeting considered pirimicarb to be not ready biodegradable based on water sediment study. In water sediment systems, pirimicarb partitions slowly from the water to the sediment. Degradation of pirimicarb in the sediment is very limited. Pirimicarb remained as the major component in both the water and the sediment. Mineralization was very low. Surface water risk assessment presented in the DAR is based on spray drift route of entry to surface water and considered photolysis in water (DT50 < id) as the main route of dissipation. The experts meeting agreed that whereas photolysis may play an important role to the dissipation of pirimicarb in certain environmental conditions, risk assessment based on a non-photolysis situation must be considered for EU evaluation. Therefore, PECsw were recalculated based on the longest first order dissipation half life (DT50 = 55d) for the water phase of the dark water/sediment system (Addendum 4, December 2004). Potential surface water contamination due to drainage and run off were not considered in the DAR. These routes may not be precluded and surface water risk assessment may not be considered complete without addressing them. The experts meeting identified potential for accumulation of pirimicarb into the sediment. Since no reliable half-life in the sediment may be obtained from the available water sediment study, a reasonable worst-case estimation was done by using DT50 = 335 d from the anaerobic soil degradation study. This value was used to calculate an accumulated PECsed = 29.tg / kg (Addendum 4, December 2004). However, as for the PECsw calculations this value only incorporates potential loadings through spray drift. The potential leaching of pirimicarb and its metabolites R34836, R34885, R31805, R34865 to ground water was simulated with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2 for the nine FOCUSgw scenarios. The resulting concentration for all the nine scenarios were below 0.001 ug / L. Soil metabolite R35140 identified in some field studies has not been assessed for potential ground water contamination. EFSA is of the opinion that it is very unlikely that the trigger of 0.1 ug / L would be exceeded by this metabolite. However, it needs to be properly addressed due the fact that it is more acutely toxic than the parent pirimicarb. Concentration of pirimicarb in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. If exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992), a high acute risk to birds from the use of pirimicarb was identified in the first tier risk assessment. The EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 13) decided to seek an opinion of EFSA's Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) on the principles used to refine this risk. The PPR Panel assessed the risk to birds feeding on insects in cereal fields after treatment with pirimicarb. Based on the results of this assessment, the PPR Panel is of the opinion that even at the upper limit of credible exposures, birds feeding on insects in the field are unlikely to achieve a lethal dose of pirimicarb\The short and long term risk to birds can be regarded as low if exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992). EFSA made a first tier risk assessment available according to SANCO/4145/2000 which confirms the high acute risk to birds but also indicates a long term risk to birds. Therefore, EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to submit a refinement of the long term risk to birds if the risk is assessed according to the latest guidance document (SANCO/4145/2000). For the acute risk to birds see opinion of the PPR Panel discussed above. The acute and long term risk to mammals can be regarded as low if exposure is calculated according to EPPO (1992) and also if exposure is calculated according to SANCO/4145/2000. The risk to aquatic organisms can be considered as high if the risk assessment is based on the standard toxicity studies with Daphnia magna without the presence of sediment. Risk mitigation measures need to be taken into account at MS level to address this risk. The experts' meeting (EPCO 13) decided to await the outcome of the opinion of EFSA's PPR Panel on dimoxystrobinl concerning the use of a study with the presence of sediment to refine the risk. Any further refinements of the risk to aquatic organisms based on studies in the presence of sediment should be performed in accordance with the opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dimoxystrobin. The experts' meeting (EPCO 13) considered the risk to bees and non target arthropods as addressed based on the available data. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from pirimicarb and the metabolites R31805 and R34865 is considered to be low. It is noted by EFSA that no studies with the soil metabolites R35140, R34885 and R34836 are available. Therefore, EFSA proposes that a study or at least a solid argumentation regarding the effects of these metabolites on soil non-target micro-organisms should be made available. The need for these data was not discussed at an EPCO experts' meeting. The risk to earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.44r,"Pirimiphos-methyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pirimiphosmethyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 December 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to wheat, barley and oats grains during storage and treatment for structural surfaces in empty grain stores at an application rate up to of 4 g pirimiphosmethyl per tonne and 50 g per 100 m(2), respectively. Pirimiphos-methyl can be used as insecticide and acaricide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Actellic 50EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered in several countries in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant and animal origin can be determined with a multi-method. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pirimiphos-methyl. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Pirimiphos-methyl is extensively metabolised in rats. The acute oral toxicity is moderate and it is of low inhalatory and dermal toxicity. Pirimiphos-methyl was slightly irritating to skin and eye as well as induced mild sensitization. Classification for acute toxicity is needed and the proposed risk phrase is: Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". Main effect is inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Pirimiphos-methyl was not genotoxic. No carcinogenic potential was evident in the mouse. Some rare brain and pancreatic tumours were seen in the rat study of old date and as a precautionary approach the classification and risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". No effect on reproductive performance was observed. Evidence of foetotoxicity, shifted pelvic position, was present at a high dose level. The effect is rather uncommon and the experts concluded that this finding was a variation and not a malformation and classification with R63 was not proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year studies from rat and dog with an overall safety factor of 100 (supported by human data) applied. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year dog study (time point 13 weeks) and the 13-week neurotoxicity study in the rat with the safety factor of 100 applied, supported by human data. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.15 mg/kg bw. The representative formulation Actellic 50EC is used as admixture and for structural treatment. The estimated exposure for admixture, large scale automated treatment, is below the AOEL. However, based on available data for structural treatment the estimated operator exposure is above the AOEL The decline of pirimiphos-methyl and the pattern of degradation products were similar in stored grain and after processing, even though the rate of decline strongly depended on the moisture content of the grain. Unchanged pirimiphos-methyl was the major residue found in grain and processed cereal products. Main metabolites were hydroxypyrimidine compounds, whereof 90% accounted for R046382g. The only metabolite considered to be of toxicological significance was R0363414. This metabolite was looked for in residue trials and processing studies and was shown to not form a significant part of the residue given the high levels of pirimiphos-methyl. Pirimiphos-methyl is classified as fat soluble. However, if grain treated according to the cGAP is fed to livestock animals no residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to occur in food of animal origin. Chronic consumer exposure from the use of pirimiphos-methyl as a structural treatment to empty stores is of no concern. With regard to chronic consumer exposure from the grain admixture use, the ADI is exceeded for all considered consumer subgroups. An acute dietary risk for consumers exposed to pirimiphos-methyl residues on wheat, barley and oat grain is not expected from both uses evaluated. Use of pirimiphos methyl will be restricted to indoor use for storage facilities treatment and stored cereals after harvest. Concentrations of pirimiphos-methyl in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to low volatility and short persistence in the atmosphere. Contamination of natural environments (soils and surface waters) through volatilization and deposition may be precluded. Studies to investigate the fate of pirimiphos methyl in the different environmental compartments are not required. However, aqueous hydrolysis and photolysis was investigated and results are summarized in the physical and chemical properties and fate and behaviour sections of the DAR. No readily biodegradability test is available, the substance may be considered as not readily biodegradable. Whereas, data available indicate that pirimiphos-methyl may be significantly volatilised from soil and leaf surfaces, concentrations of pirimiphos-methyl in the air compartment are expected to be negligible due to short persistence in the atmosphere. Contamination of natural environments through volatilization and deposition should be avoided with adequate measures to minimize the emissions from the storage facilities. The risk to birds, wild mammals, aquatic organisms, bees and non-target arthropods, soil micro- and micro organisms, including earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered low based on the use pattern of pirimiphos-methyl which is limited to enclosed food storage areas.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.102,"Rimsulfuron is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000', as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on rimsulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 August 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier DuPont de Nemours. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 12 March 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises spraying to control broad-leaved and grass weeds at application rates up 20 g rimsulfuron per hectare in maize and potatoes and up to 27.5 g rimsulfuron per hectare in tomatoes. Rimsulfuron can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Rimsulfuron 25 WG"", water dispersible granules (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi -residue -method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammals, rimsulfuron has a low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. Main target organs are liver (increase of weight, minor histopathological changes) and kidney (increased weight). In dogs, testes, epidydimes and trachea are also target organs. There is no evidence of a mutagenic, genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of rimsulfuron. Rimsulfuron does not show any adverse effects on reproductive and developmental parameters. The two major metabolites IN-709413and IN -E92604 show low acute toxicity. None of them has a genotoxic potential. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.07 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 and 143 (the oral absorption was moderate), respectively. No acute reference dose (ARfD) is needed. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL without PPE, according to German model. According to calculations with UK POEM, gloves have to be used during mixing and loading (M/L) in order to be below the AOEL. The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the systemic AOEL. Rimsulfuron is rapidly metabolised in maize, potatoes and tomatoes through two degradation pathways starting with either cleavage or contraction of the sulfonylurea bridge of the molecule. Its metabolism is similar to that found in rat and none of its metabolites is of any concern. The residue definition for plant products should be rimsulfuron for monitoring and risk assessment purposes. Supervised residue trials according to the recommended use demonstrate that residues are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) in maize grains and forage, potatoes as well as in tomatoes. No residue is to be expected in rotational and succeeding crops. Human and animal exposures to residues of rimsulfuron are therefore minimal, and no risk for consumers has been identified Soil degradation of rimsulfuron yields IN -70941, IN -709425 and IN -E9260 as major metabolites. Mineralization of the rings is very low but occurs, non extractable residues are relatively low (ca.21% applied radioactivity (AR) at 90 days). Rimsulfuron is of moderate persistence in soil, a major soil metabolite IN 70942 exhibits high persistence in soil, the remaining major soil metabolites are moderately to very highly persistent in soil. Under worst case conditions all these major soil metabolites have the potential to accumulate in soil when rimsulfuron is applied to the same area of land in consecutive years. The resulting accumulated plateau and maximum soil concentrations have been calculated for the intended uses notified. However the accumulated value calculated for IN 70941 may not represent the very worst case situation in colder climatic regions, so the risk to soil dwelling organisms from exposure to this metabolite should be considered further at MS level. Rimsulfuron and its major soil metabolites except IN -70942 exhibit very high to high mobility in soil. IN -70942 exhibits medium mobility. In the sediment water environment rimsulfuron degrades relatively rapidly through a combination of hydrolysis and microbial degradation to the major water metabolites IN -70941 and IN -70942. These metabolites and the additional metabolite IN-JF9996 are also major residues in sediment. In the natural sediment water system experiments the metabolite IN 70941 also degrades relatively rapidly, IN -70942 dissipates from the water phase relatively rapidly but is more persistent in sediment. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study IN -70942 degraded rapidly. Rimsulfuron is classified as not readily biodegradeable. PEC surface water and PEC sediment (initial) values (for parent and metabolites) to be used in the risk assessment for the representative uses from the spray drift route of exposure have been calculated, however the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water bodies have not been assessed. These routes of entry to surface water should be taken into account by MS when these routes of surface water exposure are relevant and the pertinent risk assessments to aquatic organisms should be completed by MS. For the notified intended uses rimsulfuron would not be expected to contaminate shallow vulnerable groundwater at annual average concentrations > 0.1[1g/1 based on the results of FOCUS groundwater modelling. The concentrations for metabolite IN -70941 are >0.75[Ig/L but <10[1g/1 (up to 0.85[1g/1) and for IN -E9260 are >0.1[Ig/L but <0.75[1g/1 (up to 0.48[1g/1). However effects assessments have confirmed that these metabolites are considered not relevant. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, non -target arthropods, soil macro organisms including earthworms and springtails and soil micro-organisms is low with respect to rimsulfuron and the metabolites IN -70941, IN -70 942, IN -E9260 and IN-JF 999 occurring in soil and surface water following application according to the proposed GAP. For the metabolite IN 70941 the calculated long-term TER value for earthworms was 4.5 and hence did not meet the Annex VI trigger of 5. No adverse effects were observed in the study and calculations were based on 10-yr accumulated PEC for soil using worst case laboratory data on formation fraction and DT50. The risk is therefore considered low. However Northern Member States may consider to conduct a risk assessment based on the longer DT50 obtained in a Danish field study. The metabolites IN -70941 and IN -E9260 have the potential to contaminate vulnerable shallow groundwater that may become surface water, at concentrations above those calculated for rimsulfuron in surface water. A risk assessment for aquatic plants should therefore be considered in MS with shallow ground water. Data from screening studies indicate however that these metabolites are not herbicidally active. A risk was identified for non -target terrestrial plants exposed to rimsulfuron via spray drift and risk mitigation measures need to be considered. A 5 m buffer zone or drift reducing measures are needed.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tolclofos-methyl finalised: 22 June 2005,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.32ar,"Tolclofos-methyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tolclofos-methyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 November 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Sumitomo. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 18 May 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises tuber (seed) treatment for potatoes and soil application for lettuce to control Rhizoctonia infections. The application rate is up to 0.25 kg tolclofos-methyl per tonne and 2 kg tolclofos-methyl per hectare, respectively. Tolclofos-methyl can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Tolclofos-methyl 50 WP"" (""Rizolex 50 WP""), a wettable powder (WP). However, two more formulations are mentioned in the DAR, a FS (flowable concentrate for seed treatment) and a DS (powder for dry seed treatment) formulation. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Multi-residue methods like the Dutch MM1 or the German S19 are applicable for the determinations of the residues in food. The German S19 method was also validated for soil. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of tolclofos-methyl. Sufficient test methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available. Also adequate analytical methods are available for the determination of tolclofos-methyl in the technical material and in the representative formulation. At the moment no acceptable analytical method for the determination of most of the impurities in the technical material is available. However, enough data are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the representative plant protection product are possible. Tolclofos-methyl is rapidly metabolised. It has low acute toxicity but shows sensitising properties and is proposed to be classified with the risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Following repeated oral administration of high doses of tolclofos-methyl, no evidence for cumulative toxicity was seen. Tolclofos-methyl does not possess any concern for genotoxicity. Tolclofos-methyl did not exhibit evidence of cumulative toxicity in chronic toxicity studies, and it demonstrated no carcinogenic potential. There were no direct effects on reproduction or developmental parameters. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.064 mg/kgbw/day, based on the NOAEL of 6.4 mg/kgbw/day from the 2 year toxicity study in mice. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.2 mg/kgbw/day, and no ARfD was allocated. The estimated and measured operator exposures are below the AOEL without PPE. After tuber treatment of potatoes and foliar application to lettuce unchanged tolclofos-methyl represents the major part of the total residue in these crops and no metabolites of toxicological concern were formed. Because the available metabolism study on potatoes shows deficiencies, a new study was required. Subject to confirmation by that study, tolclofos-methyl as the residue of concern was analysed in a range of supervised residue trials on potatoes, resulting in a highest residue of 0.2 mg/kg from trials under critical GAP conditions. From indoor lettuce trials a difference of residue levels in summer lettuce compared to that in winter lettuce became evident. Further residue data are required to conclude on the residue situation in summer lettuce. If potatoes with tolclofos-methyl residues are fed to livestock, with the data currently available it is not possible to exclude, that residues above 0.01 mg/kg could occur in edible animal products. Investigations in livestock animals are triggered by the residues levels in potential feeding items according to current guidelines and the available animal metabolism studies show various deficiencies. Thus, the provision of further data on metabolism in livestock is proposed. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the currently available information leads to estimated intakes less than 3% of the proposed ADI for all considered consumer subgroups. However, this assessment is provisional and needs to be reviewed upon receipt of the outstanding data. An ARfD was not allocated, thus there is no acute risk for consumers arising from tolclofos-methyl residues in food. Tolclofos-methyl degrades in soil to form DM-TM and ph-CH3. Only DM-TM was detected at levels above 10 % AR. Non-extractable residues were formed at a maximum of 49 to 64 % AR and CO2 was formed at a maximum of 27 to 43% AR. Photolysis will not significantly contribute to the overall degradation of tolclofos-methyl in soil. Tolclofos-methyl is low to moderate persistent in aerobic soil. and metabolite DM-TM was found to be very low persistent. Batch adsorption/desorption studies indicate a low potential for mobility in soil for tolclofos-methyl. Tolclofos-methyl does not hydrolyse under environmental conditions and degradation in water may be slightly enhanced by irradiation. Tolclofos-methyl is not readily biodegradable. In the water/sediment systems, tolclofos-methyl is relatively rapidly partitioned to sediment were it degrades mainly thought biotic processes. However, up to 30 % AR of tolclofos-methyl was volatilized. The metabolite DM-TM was detected in significant quantities in both water and sediment. Unextractable residues in sediment occurred at maximums of 26 to 35 % AR. Tolclofos-methyl and its breakdown products are unlikely to persist in natural aquatic environments for long time periods. For the use on lettuce in glasshouses, PECsw were estimated assuming 0.1% emission for illustrative purposes (Dutch national model). Possible surface water contamination from seed potato treatment was addressed with FOCUS surface water calculations. In all applicable scenarios PECsw for tolclofos-methyl are below 0.001 mu g/L for the use as seed treatment. Neither tolclofos-methyl nor DM-TM is expected to exceed the 0.1 mu g/L trigger in ground water for the representative uses proposed. The compound may partition from soil, moist surfaces and water to air. However, estimated half-life in air is 5.30 h not giving rise to long range transport concerns. For short term transport, the relatively low rate proposed for the representative uses limits the potential concern. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, soil macro-organisms including earthworms, soil micro-organisms, other fauna and flora and biological methods for sewage treatment is low with respect to tolclofos-methyl and the metabolite DM-TM as far as investigated.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clodinafop finalised: 10 August 2005,2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.34ar,"Clodinafop is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clodinafop-propargyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8( 1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 7 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 19 July 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as post emergent herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises broadcast spraying to control the most important grass weeds ( such as Alopecurus, Avena, Lolium, Phalaris and Setaria) in wheat, rye and triticale at an application rate of 60 g clodinafop-propargyl per hectare. The use in barley and oat is not recommended. Clodinafop can be used only as herbicide and it is always used together with the safener cloquintocet-mexyl, which significantly improves crop tolerance. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was TOPIK 100EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Due to the fact that the propargyl ester, a variant of clodinafop, is used in the formulated product, it shouldbe noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant clodinafop-propargyl, unless otherwise specified. Adequate methods are available to monitor the compounds given in the respective residue definition for soil and water. In case of food of plant origin, it depends on the final residue definition due to the fact that none of the submitted methods is enantio selective, i.e. for the monitoring of clodinafop no specific method would be available. However, only single methods for the determination of residues of both isomers (R- and S as a sum parameter) are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammals, clodinafop-propargyl is rapidly and 75% absorbed (males). There was a potential for accumulation in fat. The oral LD50 (median lethal dose) was 1392 mg/kg bw in the male rat (proposed classification: Xn; R22). Dermal and inhalatory toxicity is low. Clodinafop-propargyl was not irritating to the skin and eyes, but has sensitising properties (proposed classification: Xi; R43). Main effects during short term oral exposure were changes in biochemical parameters indicative of liver effects and changes in haematological parameters indicative of anaemia. Clodinafop-propargyl is not genotoxic. Based on increased incidences of neoplastic changes in liver, clodinafop-propargyl demonstrated oncogenic potential in rats and mice. However, this is a species specific effect and irrelevant to classification and labelling and human risk assessment (clodinafop-propargyl is a peroxisome proliferator). There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility. Clodinafop- propargyl induced delayed or absent ossification and an increase in genitourinary tract variations at doses producing effects in other general toxicity studies (some critical parameters were not measured in this study). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set to 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) to 0.05 mg/ kg bw, safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is set to 0.026 mg/ kg bw/ day with safety factor of 133 (correction for 75% oral absorption). The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL for proposed uses of Topik 100 EC. The metabolism of clodinafop-propargyl was investigated in spring wheat. It involves first a hydrolysis of the ester bond to lead to formation of clodinafop, the acid form of clodinafop-propargyl. Further degradation of the molecule consists in different cleavages and conjugation with plant sugars. No metabolite was found to present a particular toxicological concern. The possible occurrence of an isomeric conversion in the metabolism was not investigated. As parent compound cannot be considered as a valid indicator of the presence of residues due to its fast degradation, the residue definition was established as clodinafop. The EPCO experts' meeting on residues (EPCO 15) recommended inclusion of its S isomer in the residue definition as the available validated method of analysis do not distinguish the 2 isomers. This inclusion needs to be decided at risk management level as there is no data demonstrating the actual occurrence of the S-isomer in plants and as no information is available on its intrinsic toxicological properties. In animal metabolism, clodinafop was identified as major metabolite in all edible organs and tissues of ruminants and poultry. The analytical methodology did not allow detecting an eventual isomeric conversion. Supervised residue trials demonstrated the absence of residues above the analytical limit of quantification (LOQ) ( It should be noted that the method of analysis used in the residue trials is not isomer specific and consequently measures the sum of both isomers if they are both present). The MRL may be established at 0.02* mg/kg for wheat, rye and triticale. In succeeding and rotational crops, no residues are expected and no crop or cultivation restrictions are necessary. Chronic and acute exposures of consumers to residues resulting from the use of clodinafop propargyl are far below the ADI and the ARfD respectively, indicating the absence of a dietary risk. Degradation of clodinafop-propargyl in soil yields clodinafop that is further degraded. Only metabolite CGA 302371(3) was detected in amounts above the 10 % applied radioactivity (AR). Unextractable residues reached a maximum of about 58 % AR and CO2 maximums between 33 %-60 % AR. Under anaerobic conditions no new metabolites were identified. Degradation in natural soils proceeds mainly through enzymatic / microbial processes. Photolysis does not contribute to the degradation of clodinafop-propargyl in soil but may contribute to the degradation of clodinafop. Clodinafop-propargyl may be considered to be low or very low persistent in soil. The formed clodinafop is low to moderate persistent in soil and its metabolite CGA 302371 is low persistent in soil. Results of field dissipation studies confirm the low persistence of clodinafop-propargyl and its metabolites. Clodinafop-propargyl was instable at all the pH tested. The major hydrolysis product was clodinafop that was hydrolytically stable. The hydrolytic half life (DT50) of CGA 302371 at ambient temperature may be estimated to be > 1 year. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of clodinafop-propargyl and clodinafop in water. Clodinafop-propargyl is not readily biodegradable. In the water / sediment studies the parent compound was quantitatively converted into clodinafop in less than one day. Clodinafop degraded in the whole system with DT50 values of 72 d at 20 degrees C. The main degradation product was CGA 302371. Metabolite CGA 193468(4) was found at amounts up to 10 % AR in the sediment (DT50 > 68 d). The lifetime of CGA 302371 in natural aquatic systems is likely to be controlled by photochemical degradation. PECsw and PECsed estimations were based drift as the entry route to surface water. Predicted 80th percentile annual leachate concentrations of clodinafop-propargyl, clodinafop and metabolite CGA 302371 were below 0.1 mu g/L trigger for all compounds and situations modelled with FOCUS-PEARL. Concentrations of Clodinafop-propargyl clodinafop and its metabolites in air are likely to be negligible. Due to the fact that no enantioselective analysis was performed during the fate and behaviour studies, racemization in the different environmental compartments may not be excluded. Therefore, S isomers of clodinafop-propargyl and clodinafop are included in the residue definition. In case that isomerisation takes place it is assumed that the S-isomers are also formed in the ecotoxicological tests and that the endpoints deriving from the tests would cover the toxicity of the potentially formed S-isomer. The risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods and earthworms from the representative use of Topik 100 EC was assessed to be low. An effect of > 25 % on soil micro-organisms was observed in a soil microbial nitrogen transformation test with the soil metabolite CGA 302371. Taking into account that CGA 302371 was formed during the test with clodinafop-propargyl (in the sandy loam soil, the same soil as was used in the soil micro-organism study, the maximum of 18.3 % was reached at 0.1 days) and that the initial PEC soil of CGA 302371 is a factor 367 lower than the treatment rate in the study with clodinafop-propargyl where no effects > 25 % were observed, it is considered as unlikely that CGA 302371 would pose a high risk to soil micro-organisms. In order to support this assumption with data a new study with the metabolite CGA 302371 is proposed as a confirmatory data requirement. A new study with the metabolite CGA 302371 and soil micro-organisms was conducted by the notifier. The study was not assessed and not peer reviewed but should be taken into account at Member State level. The risk to non-target plants is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triticonazole finalized: 22 June 2005 (revision of 7 July 2005 with a minor clarification in the ecotoxicological risk assessment),2005,EFSA JOURNAL,3,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.33ar,"Triticonazole is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triticonazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 29 September 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 December 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 25 May 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September and October 2004. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 18 May 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises seed treatment to control a broad range of fungi belonging to several groups of plant pathogens in wheat seeds at application rate up 50 g triticonazole per tonne seed (equals up to 12.5 g/ha). Triticonazole can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Premis 25 FS"", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), registered in several countries in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of triticonazole. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Triticonazole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. Triticonazole is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalative route, it is not irritating to skin and eyes and shows no sensitizing properties. The main target organs identified were the liver and the adrenals. The ADI and AOEL is 0.025 mg/kgbw/d, based on the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kgbw/d from the 1-yr dog study, safety factor 100. The ARfD is 0.05 mg/kg bw, based on the maternal NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/d from the rabbit developmental study, with a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption rate used for the calculation of operator exposure is proposed to be 11 % for the Premis 25 FS formulation. Calculations according to the Seed TROPEX model indicate that the estimated exposure for the intended use (seed treatment of cereals) is below the AOEL for the operator, when PPE is considered, and bystanders and workers. The metabolism of triticonazole in cereals after seed dressing is well understood and does not yield metabolites of toxicological concern. No residues of triticonazole were quantified in any of the cereal grain or straw samples from field trials conducted according critical good agricultural practice (GAP). Triticonazole turned out to be persistent in soil. However, significant residues (> 0.01 mg/kg) in crops growing in rotation with seed treated cereals are not anticipated. Furthermore, there is no significant exposure of livestock to triticonazole residues in feed items. Using a residue level equal to the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg for grain in the chronic dietary risk assessment and the short term exposure risk assessment leads to estimated intakes for consumers that are significantly below (less than 1 %) of the proposed allowed daily intake (ADI) and acute reference dose (ARfD). The degradation of triticonazole in soil is initiated with the hydroxylation to a number of dihydroxy metabolites. Three metabolites amounted for more that 10 % AR in at least one soil: RPA 404766, RPA 407922 and RPA 406341. Mineralization was generally low. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 17.9 % AR after 1 year. Light induces the trans-cis isomerization of triticonazole to yield metabolite RPA 406203. Triticonazole is highly persistent under laboratory conditions (DT50 = 151 - 429 d). First order half life of metabolites RPA 406341 (DT50 = 165 - 330 d), RPA 407922 (DT50 = 3.7 - 5.1 d) and RPA 404766 (DT50 = 21 - 46 d) was obtained in soil under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions there is no significant degradation of triticonazole in soil. Results from field studies confirm the high persistence of triticonazole with mean half life in soil above 100 d. Triticonazole has potential for accumulation in soil with a theoretical plateau attained after 11 years of continuous application. Field accumulation study confirms theoretical estimates. Adsorption / desorption studies indicate that triticonazole may be classified as having medium mobility in soil, RPA 406341 high mobility, RPA 407922 medium to low mobility and RPA 4074766 high mobility. For metabolite RPA 407922 Koc values showed a pH related trend. Two lysimeters were investigated in Germany using triticonazole formulated as seed treatment. The equivalent concentration in the leachate exceeded 0.1 mu g/L for several samples. Analyses of selected samples during the second and third monitoring year show that no triticonazole was detectable in the leachate. Triticonazole is hydrolytically stable at environmental relevant pH (pH = 5 to 9). When irradiated triticonazole undergoes cis-trans isomerization. Triticonazole is not ready biodegradable. In water / sediment systems degradation of triticonazole was very slow with half lives for the whole system of 392 and 224 d. Triticonazole is adsorbed to the sediment with a DT50 = 8 - 9 d (disappearance time from the water phase). Recalculation with Model maker v. 4 (presented in the FOCUS sw calculation) result in a half life in the water phase of 85.1 d for one of the systems. Less than 2 % AR evolved as CO2 after 105 d. On the basis of FOCUS-PELMO model simulations neither triticonazole nor the degradation products RPA 407922, RPA 404766 are expected to exceed the 0.1 mu g/L trigger in ground water when used as seed treatment in cereals. Degradation product RPA 406341 may exceed the 0.1 mu g/L trigger under vulnerable situations (winter cereals, Piacenza scenario). Concentrations of triticonazole in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to low volatility and short persistence in the atmosphere. The risk to aquatic organisms, bees, earthworms, soil organic matter breakdown, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is low with respect to triticonazole and the metabolites as far as investigated. The risk to non-target arthropods can be regarded as low based on the available studies but to allow a full assessment of the risk of the representative use an additional laboratory study that addresses the effects of the intended seed treatment on sensitive life stages should be submitted. The EPCO 13 expert meeting on ecotoxicology agreed that based on the low toxicity to other species, this data requirement is confirmatory rather than a requirement for Annex I listing. A study to address this was submitted by the notifier and evaluated by the RMS who considers the study not valid for risk assessment purpose because the tested application rate is lower than the representative use rate of 12.5 ga.s./ha. EFSA agrees with the conclusion of the RMS. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from triticonazole is considered to be low. It is noted by EFSA that no studies with the major soil metabolites RPA 404766 and RPA 406341 are available. Therefore, EFSA proposes that a study or at least a solid argumentation regarding the effects of these metabolites on soil non-target micro-organisms should be made available. The need for these data was not discussed at an EPCO expert meeting. The RMS made an argumentation regarding this issue available after the evaluation meeting of 18 May 2005. This argumentation was added by EFSA to the final addendum. This argumentation was not peer reviewed. The acute, short and long term risk to herbivorous birds, the acute and short-term risk to granivorous birds and the acute and long term risk to granivorous and herbivorous mammals can be considered as low from the representative use of triticonazole as a seed treatment in wheat. The long-term (reproductive) risk to granivorous birds is considered high based on the data available at the EPCO expert meeting on ecotoxicology (EPCO 13). Further data to address this risk have been submitted by the notifier after the expert meeting and were evaluated by the RMS but not peer reviewed due to the late submission date. A full risk assessment for granivorous birds can only be concluded after further consideration of this evaluated data. The meeting agreed that the focus should be on spring sowing, being the normal breeding season for birds, and if this risk is addressed, the risk from autumn sowings should be covered as well.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.57r,"Cyprodinil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cyprodinil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January -March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control fungi from the classes Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes in winter wheat and apple at application rates of 750 g (wheat) and 225 g (apple) cyprodinil per hectare. Cyprodinil can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""UNIX 75 WG"" and "" CHORUS 50 WG"", both water dispersible granules (WG), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for food of animal origin. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multimethod (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of cyprodinil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Cyprodinil is absorbed to a high degree (> 80%) within 48 hours, based on rat excretion data. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is low as well as during inhalatory exposure. It is not a skin or an eye irritant but is a skin sensitizer (Magnusson and Kligman test). Classification for sensitization properties is needed and the proposed risk phrase is Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". Reduced body weight some minor changes in haematological and blood parameters were observed at the top dose during repeated exposure. There is no genotoxic, carcinogenic or neurotoxic potential for cyprodinil and no adverse effects were seen on reproduction parameters. None of the metabolites (3CGA 249287, 4CGA 275535, 5NOA 422054, 6CGA 321915, and 7CGA 232449) were of toxicological concern. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day with a safety factor of 100 used and no acute reference dos (ARfD) was allocated due to the low acute toxicity of cyprodinil. The dermal absorption values are 0.5% for the concentrate and 6% for the dilution and the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL for both UNIX and CHORUS without PPE according to the German model. The metabolic fate of cyprodinil in plants has been fully elucidated for the representative uses supported by the applicant. Based on the persistence of the product and the absence of metabolite of concern, the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is limited to cyprodinil. Residue studies were conducted in apples and wheat, supporting the setting of MRLs at 0.05 and 0.02* mg/kg respectively (*indicates that the LMR is set at the limit of quantification of the method of analysis.). In succeeding crops, no residues are expected at measurable level under normal conditions of use of the product and normal cropping practices. In animals a major metabolite of cyprodinil (CGA 304075) was identified and should be included in the residue definition. Feeding studies were carried out without analysis of this metabolite, and it is therefore not possible to propose MRLs for animal commodities. However, despite this lacking information, a consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account the residues in plant commodities only, indicating that the exposure of the consumer is far below the ADI of cyprodinil. Based on the metabolism data, the expected residue levels in animal commodities are expected to be very low and not of a nature to significantly influence the outcome of the intake calculations based on plant commodities only. The available data demonstrate that in soil cyprodinil degrades to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287. The minor breakdown products 8CGA 304075, 9CGA 304076 and CGA 321915 were also identified. Mineralization of the phenyl and pyrimidyl rings accounted for only 6-14% AR and 0.3-11% AR respectively after 90-112 days incubation at 20-25 degrees C. The corresponding values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile including Soxhlet extraction were 36.8 -61.2 % AR and 10.6 -68.3 % AR. In most studies Cyprodinil exhibited moderate persistence in soil with the major metabolites CGA 275535 and CGA 249287 exhibiting very low persistence and moderate to high persistence respectively. In field studies this pattern of soil persistence was confirmed with there being evidence that the analysed extractable breakdown products (CGA 275535, CGA 249287 and CGA 321915) declined in concentration after their maximum measured concentrations. However it was observed in the 1 laboratory experiment with a more acidic soil (pH 5.2) and in a very acidic (pH 4.9) soil in 1 German field experiment, that cyprodinil exhibited very high persistence. Cyprodinil could therefore be more persistent in very acid soils (around pH 5 and below), though the available database (2 acidic soil experiments) is too small to confirm this hypothesis. Member States which have significant areas of acidic soils in arable or horticultural production should request additional information to confirm if this is a real correlation and if it is confirmed, further information to address the consequences of higher persistence in acidic soils. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cyprodinil and CGA 275535 exhibited low mobility. CGA 249287 exhibited medium to low mobility in soil, with adsorption of CGA 249287 appearing to be pH dependent (lowest adsorption at highest soil pH). In sediment water systems cyprodinil dissipated from water relatively rapidly, partitioning to sediment where it exhibited high persistence. It did degrade to the metabolite CGA 249287 which was a major sediment but minor water metabolite. This metabolite exhibited moderate persistence. The major sink in the mass balance was the formation of residues not extracted by acetonitrile: water Soxhlet extraction. Mineralization of the pyrimidyl ring to CO2 was low < 5% AR after 260 days. This value for the phenyl ring was slightly higher at up to 11% AR. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for assessing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. The drainage and runoff routes of entry have not been assessed. These routes of entry should be taken into account by MS when these routes of entry to surface water are relevant and the pertinent risk assessment to aquatic organisms should be completed. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates that the potential for groundwater contamination as a consequence of the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing for cyprodinil and its major soil metabolites CGA 249287 and CGA 275535 is minimal when soil pH is above 5. This assessment appropriately covered the observed lower soil adsorption of CGA 249287 at higher soil pH. As there is evidence cyprodinil might be more persistent in very acidic soils, MS that have significant areas of such soils associated with pertinent plant production and vulnerable groundwater leaching situations should require applicants to provide groundwater exposure assessments to cover this situation. A high long term risk was identified for insectivorous birds for the representative use in cereals (application to late growth stages). The EPCO experts' meeting agreed that a risk assessment for early growth stages in cereals should be conducted since it is not fully justified that growth stage BBCH 32 of wheat can be regarded as a late growth stage. The RMS presented a risk assessment for early growth stages in addendum 2. The TER values for the long term risk to insectivorous birds, herbivorous birds and herbivorous mammals were 2.8, 4.8 and 1.7, respectively, indicating a high risk to birds and mammals from the intended use in wheat if the product is applied to early growth stages. A refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds and a refined long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was provided by the notifier and summarized in addendum 3. Addendum 2 and addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. The RMS considers the risk to herbivorous birds as low since the first tier TER value of 4.8 is close to the trigger of 5 and based on the NOEC from the highest tested dose in a reproduction study. However, it should be taken into account that the argumentation provided in addendum 2 is not peer reviewed. A high risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was shown in a first tier risk assessment for the representative use in cereals and a high long term risk to birds for the representative use in orchards. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low. The risk to birds and mammal of secondary poisoning and the risk from uptake of plant metabolites is considered to be low. Crustaceans (Cladocera) were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for the representative use in apples indicated a high acute and chronic risk to fish and daphnids. For the representative use in cereals a high acute and chronic risk was identified only for daphnia. Additional single species tests were used to reduce the acute TER trigger value from 100 to 10 in the higher tier risk assessment. The risk assessment based on the endpoints from single species tests resulted in TER values which meet the relevant acute and chronic Annex VI trigger values taking into account buffer zones of 40 m (orchards) and 10 m (cereals). Depending on the outcome of the PPR opinion on the use of the microcosm study, the results of the microcosm study could be taken into account at MS level for further risk refinement. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil nontarget micro-organisms, other non-target-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.55r,"Clopyralid is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clopyralid in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 December 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 January 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Two other companies (Barclay Chemicals and United Phophorus Ltd.) also notified but it was not possible to reach an agreement. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January - March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control a narrow spectrum of broadleaved weeds in cereals, oilseed rape, sugar beet and pasture at application rate up 127 g clopyralid per hectare for cereals, up to 300 g for oilseed rape and sugar beet, and up to240 g for pasture. Clopyralid can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Lontrel 100"", an emulsifiable concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for food of animal origin. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Clopyralid is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed in the rat. It is widely distributed and the highest concentration was found in the liver. There was no evidence of accumulation. Clopyralid is not metabolised. The acute toxicity is low i.e. oral LD50 > 5000 mg/kg bw, dermal LD50 > 2000 mg/kg bw and inhalatory exposure LC50 > 1 mg/L air. It does not induce skin irritancy or sensitization. However, clopyralid induced a marked irritation in the eyes of the rabbit and the symptoms persisted after 21 days. Thus, the proposal for classification for acute toxicity is Xi; R41"" Risk of serious damage to eyes"". It is not genotoxic, carcinogenic or toxic towards reproduction. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.15 and 1 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 applied. No ARfD is set. A default of 10% for dermal absorption is set for Lontrel 100. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL even without PPE (34%), according to the UK POEM model. No extensive metabolism occurred in the crops studied and hence clopyralid was found to be the major component of the residue in plants. The metabolism of clopyralid was similar in all studied crop groups and an adequate number of residue trials on the representative crops cereals, sugar beet, rape seed and pasture is available. For the use on cereals the experts' meeting for residues concluded that processing studies need to be submitted. Significant amounts of clopyralid residues were found in potential feeding stuff. Therefore animal metabolism was investigated in ruminants and in poultry, indicating the majority of the residue found in animal matrices being clopyralid in free and conjugated form (the latter mainly in milk). From the study it was concluded that, apart from conjugation with glycin, clopyralid was not metabolised in livestock and that the occurrence of significant residues (> 0.01 mg/kg) in edible animal tissues may be expected. Thus, feeding studies with clopyralid in ruminants, hens and pigs have been evaluated. It is noted that further data need to be submitted to assess the validity of some of the metabolism and feeding studies and to confirm the proposed MRLs for food of animal origin. Data to support the assumption that no significant residues will occur in rotational crops have not been submitted, but may be required since there are indications that clopyralid residues in soil may be taken up and accumulated in rotational crops. In a consumer risk assessment it was demonstrated that exposure to residues resulting from the representative uses of clopyralid is well below the ADI for the considered consumer groups. Even though intake of clopyralid residues is not likely to pose a high risk to consumers the current assessment needs to be confirmed by the data still to be submitted. An acute risk for consumers through clopyralid residues on food is not anticipated, as no ARfD has been proposed. No degradation products of clopyralid that accounted for more than 10 % AR were identified in soil under aerobic conditions. Volatiles collected in a trap with alkaline solution (attributed to CO2) amounted up to a maximum of 83.3 % AR. Minimal degradation occurred under anaerobic conditions. Photolysis will not contribute to the dissipation of clopyralid in soil. Clopyralid is moderate to medium persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at application rates in the range of the ones proposed for the representative uses but degradation seems to be slower when higher application rates are used. In the field studies clopyralid dissipated slightly faster being low to moderate persistent. Only initial PEC soil are used in the ecotoxicological risk assessment. The batch soil adsorption/desorption studies indicate that clopyralid is very high mobile in soil. Lysimeter studies show exceedance of 0.1 mu g /L at individual data points but not as annual average. However, none of the lysimeter studies represent the worst case GAP. Notifier has indicated to the RMS their wish not to support anymore autumn uses. Therefore, neither interim nor final reports of the lysimeter study after the autumn application (Study K84) have been submitted. MS may need to require it for their assessment. Clopyralid is expected to be stable to hydrolysis at environmental relevant pHs. Photodegradation will not be an environmental significant degradation pathway in water. Clopyralid should be classified as a non ready biodegradable. Clopyralid partitions slowly from the water to the sediment and reaches a maximum of 30.6 % AR after 100 d into the sediment. There is practically no degradation of clopyralid in the water /sediment system and up to 91 % AR remains as clopyralid at the end of the experiment (100 d). Non extractable radioactivity in the sediment amounted up to 5.85 % AR at the end of the study. The amount of CO2 formed slowly increased to between 2.3 % and 5.3 % AR after 100 d. PEC sw were calculated based on the critical GAP from the table of representative uses and spray drift loadings. FOCUS sw was not used but run off and drainage were considered in the DAR. For run off PEC sw were calculated based on a 0.5 % run off from a 1 ha field to a 0.2 ha surface and 1m depth pond. For contamination through drain flow UK scheme was followed, giving rise to higher concentrations than those obtained by spray drift. This value was used for the risk assessment presented in the DAR. As for PEC sw, also drain flow PEC sed was the higher one. Therefore, EFSA proposes that a comprehensive aquatic risk assessment taking into account spray drift, run-off, drainage and the effectiveness of potential risk mitigation measures should be conducted following the FOCUS sw scheme to confirm the results of this assessment. PEC gw of clopyralid were estimated using FOCUS-PELMO 2.2.2. and the mean normalized laboratory half life (DT50 = 38 d) corrected for the moisture content (36 d). Calculation of the 80th percentile of annual average concentrations of clopyralid at 1 m depth show that the 0.1 mu g /L is exceeded for all the relevant scenarios corresponding to some of the proposed uses and for a number of scenarios of the rest of them. An assessment based on field half lives has been presented to the RMS and summarized in addendum 2 (August 2005) but has not been peer reviewed. A complete report on this new modelling is required. Based on the peer reviewed data, MS may need to consider risk for potential ground water contamination under vulnerable situations. Autumn uses are not longer supported by the notifier and are not covered by this assessment. Concentration of clopyralid in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and soil macro-and microorganisms from clopyralid used according to the proposed GAP is considered low based on available studies and information. For the maximum application rate proposed in a single application, 240 g a. s./ha for pasture, a 5 m buffer zone or drift reducing measures are necessary to protect non-target plants outside the field. Calculated TER values are 3.8 and 18.5 at 1 and 5 m distance respectively based on a spray drift of 2.77 %. No major soil or water/sediment metabolites were detected in the soil degradation studies or in the water/sediment studies. Therefore the risk assessment for the environment is based solely on clopyralid.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metconazole finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.64r,"Metconazole is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 27 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - Mai 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control foliar and ear diseases in cereals and oilseed rape at application rate up to 90 g metconazole per hectare. Metconazole can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Caramba 60 SL"", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some EU Member States. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food and soil can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The acute oral toxicity of metconazole is moderate (a classification Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). Metconazole is of low acute dermal and inhalatory toxicity. It is not a skin or eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity is 6.4 mg/kg bw/day. Adrenals, liver and spleen were detected as target organs. Overall, metconazole is not genotoxic. The NOAEL for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day. It was considered that the compound was unlikely to be classified as a carcinogenic substance. The NOAELs for parental, reproduction and offspring toxicity are 8 mg/kg bw/day; based on the absence of effect on fertility in the rat 2-generation study (only modification of fertility parameters at maternotoxic doses). Both compounds are embryo- and foetotoxic at doses also producing maternal toxicity in rat developmental toxicity studies. Therefore, classification as Repro Cat. 3 (Xn; R63) was agreed on. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Levels (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/d with a safety factor of 400 (the increased SF is due to teratogenic effects). Operator exposure is below the AOEL when PPE is worn. The exposure during re-entry activities and for bystanders is negligible. In the plant metabolism studies conducted in wheat and oilseed rape, metconazole, triazolyl alanine and triazolyl acetic acid were identified as the major components of the total residues in the edible plant parts of the tested crops. Triazolyl alanine is a common metabolite of triazole fungicides, and its toxicological profile was considered as sufficiently investigated. The residue of concern in cereals and oilseed crops is therefore metconazole only. The enrichment of edible plant parts of succeeding crops with metconazole was not sufficient to reach quantifiable levels, when metconazole is used according cGAP. A complete residue trials data base on wheat, rye, triticale and oilseed rape was provided for Northern and Southern Europe and allowed MRL proposals. For barley uses in Southern Europe additional trial data need to be submitted to confirm the compliance with currently proposed MRL based on Northern European trials. Due to low consumer exposure industrial or household processing studies are not required. Since significant residues occur in potential feed stuff, metabolism studies have been submitted in lactating goats and laying hens. In lactating goats, metconazole undergoes an extensive metabolisation, but was still detected in edible goat matrices bar kidney. All the metabolites found in goat tissues have been recovered in the rat. In a non peer reviewed addendum (December 2005) RMS concluded that representative uses do not give rise to significant residues in animal products and MRLs do not need to be proposed. In contrast, estimates of possibly occurring residues levels in animal matrices done by EFSA indicated that relevant residue levels might be expected in ruminant liver. According to current guidelines a feeding study with ruminants would be required and MRLs for food of animal origin (i.e. ruminant liver) need to be proposed. In laying hens, the metabolic profile was not further investigated and no such data is currently required since the intake by poultry is not significant with regard to the representative uses. The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil metconazole exhibits medium to high persistence based on northern and southern European field studies where applications were made in May and June. Consequently the available laboratory studies did not identify any major (>10% of applied radioactivity (AR)) soil metabolites. Mineralization of the 3,5-triazole-14C radiolabel accounted for 10.3% AR in dark aerobic laboratory soil studies after 91 days. The formation of unextracted residues in the soil organic carbon was the significant sink (accounting for 12-28% AR at 91-112 days). Metconazole exhibited low mobility in soil (based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies) There was no evidence that adsorption changed with variation in soil pH. In natural sediment water systems (dark laboratory studies) metconazole dissipated from the water relatively rapidly by partitioning to sediment. Once in the sediment degradation was slow with metconazole exhibiting high to very high persistence. The 3,5-triazole-C-14-label, did not mineralize to CO2 at all. Formation of unextracted sediment radioactivity (11-19%AR at 100 days) and the formation of up to 6 resolved minor (<= 9% AR) metabolites (5 identified) accounted for the slow loss of metconazole in these static experimental systems. It is a concern, that from the acceptable standard guideline studies required and provided, in terms of accounting for the route of breakdown and completing the material balance of metconazole, it is only possible to conclude that metconazole is persistent in the sediment of aquatic systems (there was no evidence that the metabolites formed were mineralised, the only sink identified was unextracted sediment radioactivity). Based on the available data, photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of metconazole in natural aquatic systems. The environmental exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete the necessary EU level estimates of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) for the representative uses applied for, for annex 1 listing. Because of the persistence of metconazole in soil and aquatic sediment it was necessary for exposure assessments to take into account the potential accumulation of metconazole in these environmental matrices from potential use in consecutive years. Member States must also do this when assessing potential uses of metconazole at the national level. Member States also need to carry out aquatic exposure and risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water as these routes of entry have not been considered in the EU level assessments available. FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated a low potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for the uses assessed in this conclusion. (At all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios annual average leachate concentrations of metconazole leaving the top 1m soil layer were predicted to be below the parametric legal drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L). The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals are low from the representative uses. The first tier TER values indicated a high long-term risk for insectivorous and herbivorous birds (TER of 2.3 to 3.1) and a high long-term risk to herbivorous mammals. The EPCO experts meeting identified the requirement for further information to justify the choice of the focal species and data on more species to refine the long term risk to insectivorous birds. The experts meeting agreed to the refinement of long-term exposure based on residue data in cereals. The long-term risk to herbivorous birds was shown to be low for both representative uses. However, further refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to small herbivorous mammals for the representative use in cereals (TER of 2.9). The acute and the long term risk to mammals from the representative use in oilseed rape are considered to be low. The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was discussed at the experts meeting. It was agreed that the TER calculations should be based on the plateau PECsoil plus one application. The resulting TER values for birds and mammals of 10.5 and 5.3 are above the Annex VI trigger of 5 indicating a low risk from the representative uses. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water was calculated by EFSA according to Sanco/4145/2000 in an addendum. The first tier TER values indicated a high short-term and long term risk to birds and a high long-term risk to mammals. A refined risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water is required for the intended uses in cereals and oilseed rape. The acute risk to aquatic organisms is low. The long-term risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as buffer zones up to 15 m are required. The Annex VI trigger values were not met for NTA in a first tier testing. The higher tier tests showed that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. A field litter bag study has been performed at an application rate equivalent to the supported GAP. No effects were observed in the study after 3 months and after 6 months of exposure. As some drawbacks have been identified in the study, the experts meeting set a data requirement to submit a new litter bag study available to the applicant. The evaluation of this new study would allow completing the risk assessment. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered to be low for the representative uses.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metrafenone finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.58r,"Metrafenone is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 United Kingdom received an application from BASF for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/105/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on metrafenone, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 31 October 2003. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 24 November 2003. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2003 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide which comprises broadcast spraying to control powdery mildew in cereals (wheat and barley) and grapevines at application rates up 150 g metrafenone per hectare (cereals)(3) and 100 g per hectare (grapevines), respectively. Metrafenone can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""BAS 560 00 F"" (cereal use) and ""BAS 560 02 F"" (grapevine use), both are suspension concentrates (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metrafenone. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Metrafenone is rapidly absorbed and excreted and widely distributed. The acute toxicity is low. It is not a skin or an eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. The target organ in all species was the liver (increased weight and histopathological findings). Metrafenone did not show any genotoxic potential. It is carcinogenic in rodents at very high doses of limited relevance for humans. Metrafenone did not affect reproductive and developmental parameters at not maternally toxic doses. Metrafenone does not show any neurotoxic potential. No reports are available on medical surveillance and acute poisonings because industrial production of metrafenone has not yet commenced. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for metrafenone is 0.25 mg/kg bw/day and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.43 mg/kg bw/day with a safety factor (SF) of 100. Based on the toxicological characteristics of metrafenone setting an ARfD is not needed. The exposure for the operators applying metrafenone has been assessed with UK and German models (not exceeding the 53% of the AOEL). Exposure is below the AOEL for re-entry workers or bystanders. Applied to wheat plants and vines by foliar application metrafenone itself was the major component identified at harvest in the analysed plant parts. Few metabolites of metrafenone were identified in vine leaves and wheat straw, and, basically, there was no evidence that molecular cleavage occurred. In grain the majority of the radioactivity got incorporated into plant material. In rotational crop studies metrafenone was not present at significant levels in the succeeding crops. Decline of metrafenone residues under processing conditions does not occur. Fed to ruminants and poultry, metrafenone was extensively metabolised in the liver and kidney. The metabolites identified in the goat metabolism study are structurally similar to those found in the rat metabolism study. Even though metrafenone is classified as fat-soluble (logPow 4) there was no evidence for accumulation of residues in adipose tissue. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the representative GAP indicated that for all consumer subgroup the intake was less then 1% of the proposed ADI. Metrafenone exhibited high persistence in soil under aerobic conditions. Very low levels of extractable metabolites were found and identified. Mineralization was low and unextractable radioactivity accounted for 24.8 % AR after 120 d. Under anaerobic conditions metrafenone degrades much faster than under aerobic conditions and a large number of metabolite fractions are formed. A high amount of the radioactivity corresponded to unresolved areas on TLC plates and procedural losses (up to 30 % AR). Since extraction procedures included some harsh treatments the applicant considered that the majority of the residue in soil would not be bioavailable. In a second anaerobic study, the main metabolites identified were CL 377160 (max. 5.3 % at 7d) and CL 4084564 (7.3 % at 28 d). Photolysis also contributes to the degradation of metraphenone. Compound CL 377160 (max. 18.9 % AR) was formed as a major soil photolysis product. Under dark aerobic conditions, the photolysis metabolite CL 377160 is rapidly degraded (DT90 < 7 d). Most of the degradation will contribute the formation of unextractable residue (63.1 - 74.2 % AR at 120 d, end of the study). The major fraction of the unextractable residue is associated with the humin soil fraction (22.2 - 35.9 % AR). Field dissipation studies were conducted in four sites in Europe located in Germany, United Kingdom, Denmark and Northern France. Under field conditions metrafenone is medium to high persistent in soil (DT (50 field) = 70 - 144 d). Since the field studies were performed on bare soils (with a potentially high contribution of photolysis) and the representative uses proposed are for developed crops were the foliage will shadow the field, RMS proposed to use the worst case laboratory half life for the EU risk assessment. Four field accumulation studies were initiated in 1999 and planned to finalise in 2004. Three trials were performed in grapevines in Germany, Italy and Spain and a trial in cereals in Germany. Interim reports of these studies were submitted to the RMS. The main concern raised by these studies was that after 5 years the plateau was still not reached. A modelling exercise based on PEARL leaching model with worst case degradation input parameters show that the plateau is reached after 10 years of continuous application. The results of this model have been used as PEC soil for the EU risk assessment. Metrafenone may be classified as low mobile to immobile (K-foc = 1592 - 5556 mL / g) and metabolite CL 377160 as slightly mobile to immobile (K-foc = 2199 - 21649 mL / g) in soil. Metrafenone is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions of pH and temperature. Photolysis may contribute to the degradation of metrafenone in water. Metrafenone is not readily biodegradable. Two aerobic water sediment systems at 20 degrees C under dark conditions were investigated. Metrafenone was found to dissipate relatively rapidly from water. Metrafenone is also low persistent in the total systems (DT50 total systems = 8.5 - 9.2 d). Unextractable residues were formed up to 15.7 - 26.4 % AR at the study end. Mineralization was 2.6 - 12.4 % at the study end. Only minor metabolites were identified in the water / sediment systems. PECSW were calculated for the buffer distances of 3 m, 5m and 10m assuming spray drift from single and multiple applications (2 x 150 g/ha with 21 d interval in cereals and 8 x 100 g/ha with 12 d interval in vines) taking as basis the worst case dissipation half life observed in the water phase of the dark water sediment study (DT50 water = 4.6 d). Same premises were used to calculate initial PECSED. The RMS also provided PECSW of metrafenone and its soil photolysis metabolite CL 377160 derived from drainage on cereal crops based on their national scheme. For the active substance the calculationalso considered the drainflow of the accumulated substance in soil. The drainflow concentration obtained was of 0.97 mu g/ L (70 % of what would be expected form spray drift at 1m). Potential surface water contamination through run-off was not assessed in the DAR. Experts' meeting agreed that due to the high Koc of the active substance runoff and drainage will be of limited significance and that for the purposes of the EU risk assessment no further information was necessary. However, Member States may need to pay special attention to runoff and drain flow in their national risk assessment taking into considerations the particular conditions of their crops. The 80th percentile PECGW concentrations of metrafenone and metabolite CL 377160 at 1m depth were less than 0.001 mu g / L for the spring and winter cereals and vines in all the relevant FOCUS Groundwater Scenarios (FOCUS PEARL, v. 1.1.1.). Metrafenone may be prone to some volatilization from soil or water surfaces. However, it is strongly adsorbed in soil matrices and its atmospheric photochemical oxidative half life was calculated to be 0.63 h and it is not expected to be subject to long-range transport. The risk to birds and mammals was calculated using the nomogram of Hoerger and Kenaga (EPPO 1992) and according to the Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for Birds and mammals Under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (SANCO/4145/2000). The risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds in cereals and to insectivorous birds in grapevines can be regarded as low according to both risk assessments. Also the risk to herbivorous and insectivorous mammals in cereals and herbivorous mammals in grapevines can be regarded as low according to both risk assessments. The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning is regarded to be low for the representative uses evaluated. It was noted by EFSA that no risk assessment for birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water was performed. This risk assessment is presented in the addendum by EFSA. The risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water is considered to be low except for the long term risk to birds in cereals for which the TER value is below the trigger value indicating a high long term risk to birds in cereals from drinking contaminated drinking water. Therefore EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to refine the long term risk to birds in cereals from exposure to contaminated drinking water. This assessment was neither discussed at the EPCO expert's meeting nor peer reviewed. The risk to aquatic organisms is regarded to be low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to bees and other arthropod species can be regarded as low based on the available studies. The risk to earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms and soil micro-organisms can be regarded as low. The risk to non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenitrothion finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.59r,"Fenitrothion is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenitrothion in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 November 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January - March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying in tomato and grapevine at application rates up to 750 g per hectare. Fenitrothion can be used only as insecticide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""IPM 400"", a capsule suspension concentrate (CS), registered under different trade names in southern Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fenitrothion. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Fenitrothion (FNT) is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is mainly distributed to the liver, blood and carcass. Elimination is very rapid. The main metabolites are the phosphate fenitrothion (FNO), the mono methyl analogues of FNT and FNO (DM-FNT and DM-FNO respectively) and 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (NMC) and its corresponding sulphate and glucuronide. The oral LD50 is 330-1700 mg/kg bw.The dermal LD50 is 890 mg/kg bw, therefore the classification R21 (Harmful in contact with the skin), is proposed. FNT acute inhalatory toxicity is low. FNT is not a skin or an eye irritant in rabbits, but it is a skin sensitiser. Therefore, the classification R43 (May cause sensitisation in contact with the skin), is proposed. The critical effect is decreased erythrocyte and brain cholinesterase. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 1.32 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rats. No evidence of delayed neurotoxicity was found in hens following acute and subacute exposures. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) are 0.013 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor (SF) of 100. The estimated operator exposure in grapes exceeds the AOEL, as well as re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE. In outdoor tomatoes: the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL only for field crop spraying with the use of PPE; re-entry exposure estimates for workers not wearing PPE exceed the AOEL. A biomonitoring study in greenhouse tomatoes not fully representative of the intended uses showed exposure below the AOEL (maximum 25%). The exposure to harvesters without PPE would be acceptable. Exposure estimates for general re-entry activities exceed the AOEL for workers not wearing PPE. Metabolism studies of fenitrothion in tomatoes and grapes indicate that the major metabolic pathway proceeds through the hydrolysis of the compound leading to 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol and dimethylphosphorothioic acid. 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol is further conjugated and has no anticholinesterase activity. Due to the labelling position, the fate of dimethylphosphorothioic acid was not further investigated. Another minor pathway consists in O-demethylation of fenitrothion leading to desmethylfenitrothion. The proposed residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is fenitrothion only. However the possible contribution of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid to the toxicological burden is not known and should be investigated before the residue definition for risk assessment can be finalised. Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted in accordance with the representative uses and supporting the establishment of MRLs at 3 and 0.1 mg/kg in grapes (table and wine grapes) and tomatoes respectively. The behaviour of residues through processing was investigated and it was shown that fenitrothion is degraded into desmethylfenitrothion under hydrolysis conditions. Low transfer factors of fenitrothion were calculated for the processing to grape juice, wine, tomato puree and tomato juice. Metabolism studies in livestock were submitted although not required as the representative uses do not imply animal exposure to residues of fenitrothion through feedingstuffs. These studies were not sufficient to build a complete picture of the nature of the residues to be expected in all animal commodities. Acute and chronic risk assessments have been carried out taking into account fenitrothion residues only. These assessments have demonstrated a potential for acute risk for the consumer resulting from the consumption of treated table grapes. For the other commodities, although the exposure to fenitrothion residues is below the trigger toxicological values, a robust conclusion is not possible at this stage, given the lack of information on the toxicological relevance and the actual levels in commodities of desmethylfenitrothion and dimethylphosphorothioic acid. In soil under dark aerobic conditions fenitrothion yields the major metabolite NMC. Substantial formation of unextractable residues and mineralization was observed. Under dark anaerobic conditions AM-FNT and AA-FNT were found to be the major metabolites. Photolysis in soil is unlikely to contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion. Fenitrothion is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions when applied directly or formulated as and emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Half life is significantly longer for the encapsulated formulation proposed for the representative uses (CS: DT (50 lab CS) = 82.3 d). Additional laboratory and field dissipation studies with the CS formulation were required and have been presented but have not been evaluated by the RMS. The experts' meeting agreed to propose a restriction to use only in green houses until the data requirements for the CS formulation are fulfilled. The major metabolite NMC is low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.8 -3.3 d). PECs in soil presented in the DAR can not be regarded as worst case. Therefore, risk assessment for the EU representative uses may not be considered concluded and reassessment will be necessary once the data requirement for further soil studies with the CS formulation is fulfilled. Fenitrothion is medium mobile (K-oc = 252- 384 mL / g) and NMC is medium mobile (K-foc = 270-303 mL / g) in soil. Fenitrothion shows a slow hydrolytic degradation. The release rate of the CS formulation was investigated in sterile aqueous buffer solutions. It is reasonable to expect that the further soil studies already required for the CS formulation will provide additional information on the release rate of fenitrothion in soil. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of fenitrothion in water. However, this contribution is deemed to be low for the fenitrothion applied as an encapsulated formulation. Fenitrothion is not readily biodegradable in water. In water-sediment systems fenitrothion (pure active substance) dissipated rapidly from the water phase. NMC, AM-FNT, Unk 2 (tentatively identified as DM-AM-FNT), Unk 6 (tentatively identified as A-NMC and considered an analytical artefact of NMC) were the major metabolites in the water phase. In the sediment phase only NMC was measured at levels above 10 % of AR. All metabolites declined to very low levels until the end of the study. Most of the applied radioactivity accumulated in the NER fraction of the sediment that undergoes slow further mineralization with CO2 release. An aerobic water-sediment study compares the degradation of fenitrothion applied as the CS formulation with an EC formulation. When applied as CS formulation the capsules tend to settle in the sediment phase. The DT50 for the CS formulated fenitrothion was beyond the duration of the study and estimated to be 84 97 days for the whole system. The PECSW and PECSED were calculated for the field uses with spray drift as the only entry route into surface water. PECSW values were also provided for the metabolites AM-FNT, DM-AM-FNT and NMC. These PECSW/SED may need to be revised on basis of new information on the release rate. The applicant submitted PECSW / PECSED calculation for the use in glasshouses based on the Netherlands scheme. However, this calculation was not evaluated by the RMS which proposed a non exposure situation for this use. Experts' meeting concluded that potential surface water contamination arising from glasshouse representative use needs to be assessed taking also into account the high potential risk to aquatic organisms and the potential for volatilization (see chapter 5.2.). However, the difficulties to perform this risk assessment at this stage, due to the lack of EU agreed procedure, were recognized by the meeting. On basis of the FOCUS ground water calculations, concentrations of fenitrothion and the metabolite NMC were not expected to exceed 0.1 mu g / L in ground water, irrespective to the release rate from the capsules (DT50 release = 0 - 250 d were simulated). According the Henry Law constant there is some potential for volatilization of fenitrothion. The use as a microencapsulated formulation will reduce this potential for volatilization. Furthermore, half life in air was calculated to be 6 h indicating that long range transport is not likely. The acute, short-term and the long-term risk to birds and the long term risk to mammals from uptake of contaminated food items was assessed as high from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine). Consequently further risk refinement steps are necessary to address the risk to birds and mammals. A high long term risk to birds and mammals was identified from the uptake of contaminated earthworms. The applicant submitted new information on the risk to birds and mammals from fenitrothion residues in earthworms and further information to address the risk of secondary poisoning from consumption of contaminated fish and a statement on the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water. This new information was not evaluated by the RMS. Daphnia magna was the most sensitive tested aquatic species. A high acute and chronic risk from the representative outdoor uses was identified. The relevant acute Annex VI TER trigger values are exceeded only if buffer zones of 200 m (tomato) and 175 m (grapevine) are taken into account. However, even with buffer zones as large as 250 m the chronic TER values are still below the Annex VI trigger value of 10. The applicant submitted a risk assessment based on the Netherlands scheme for calculating emissions from greenhouses. This risk assessment was not evaluated by the RMS. Instead a no exposure situation was proposed. The Experts' meeting agreed that PECsw water calculations for the greenhouse use are needed. A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms from the representative use in greenhouses cannot be drawn. However, taking into account the very high toxicity to daphnids, a high risk to aquatic organisms from the greenhouse use cannot be excluded if exposure of aquatic organisms from greenhouse use is possible. The acute risk of the major metabolites in the water-sediment system, NMC and AM-FNT were assessed as low. Testing with the metabolite DM-AM-FNT was considered as not necessary because it is very unstable and the precursor AM-FNT is three orders of magnitude less toxic than fenitrothion. A mesocosm study was submitted by the applicant prior to the Experts' meeting to refine the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The mesocosm study was not evaluated by the RMS because it was considered as not relevant by the RMS for the greenhouse use. A high risk to bees was shown from oral and contact exposure to fenitrothion (technical) and for contact toxicity of the formulation IPM 400 CS. Higher tier studies with bees were available. However, the studies were conducted for other uses than the representative uses. It was not clear whether the available studies address the risk from the representative uses in tomato and grapevine. Therefore a high risk to bees from the representative outdoor uses cannot be excluded. Risk mitigation measures like labelling were suggested by the RMS. It was agreed at the EPCO Experts` meeting that risk mitigation measures for pollinating insects have to be set at MS level for the representative use in greenhouses. Higher tier tests were conducted to address the risk to non-target arthropods. Freshly dried residues of an application of IPM 400 at a dose rate similar to the GAP led to significant mortality in the tested non-target arthropods. Aphidius rhopalosiphi was the most sensitive species. No significant effects on mortality or fecundity of A. rhopalosiphi were observed in tests with 42 d aged residues showing the potential of recolonisation. An elaborated risk assessment for the off-field risk from the representative outdoor uses (tomato and grapevine) to non-target arthropods is considered necessary. A final conclusion on the risk to non-target arthropods from the outdoor use can be drawn when the off-field risk assessment is made available. Because of the high toxicity to non-target arthropods the meeting proposed a labelling for the greenhouse use to protect species which are used for biological pest control. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed to be low but the long-term risk to earthworms was assessed as high. Further information to address the long-term risk to earthworms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but not evaluated by the RMS. The chronic risk from the soil metabolite NMC posed to earthworms is considered to be low. No information was available on the toxicity of fenitrothion to other soil non-target organisms. Fenitrothion is formulated as a slow release micro-capsule and the DT90lab for the formulation was estimated to be 283 days. A high long term risk was observed for earthworms and for non-target arthropods in the higher tier studies. Therefore a data requirement was set by the RMS to address the risk to other soil non-target macro-organisms. Further information to address the risk to soil non-target macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant in September 2004 but was not evaluated by the RMS. The risk from fenitrothion from the representative uses to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed to be low. Further information submitted by the applicant to address the risk of the soil metabolite NMC was not evaluated by the RMS. Therefore a final conclusion on the risk of the soil metabolite NMC to soil non-target micro-organisms cannot be drawn. The risk of fenitrothion to other non-target organisms (flora) and biological methods of biological sewage treatment is considered to be low. Further data/information to address the risk from the outdoor uses to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms was submitted prior to the EPCO Experts' meeting. This data/information was not evaluated by the RMS and no further risk assessment was conducted. As far as the risk from the representative outdoor uses was assessed (not taking into account the new information/data and further risk refinement steps) it is preliminary concluded that the outdoor uses pose a high risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil-non target micro-organisms. The risk from the greenhouse use (provided it is a permanent construction and no natural soil is used) posed to birds and mammals, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms and soil non-target micro-organisms is considered to be low. Risk mitigation measures are suggested for the greenhouse use for pollinating insects, non-target arthropods (species used in biological pest control). A risk assessment for aquatic organisms should be conducted for the representative use in greenhouses at Member State level.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pyrimethanil finalised: 13 January 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.61r,"Pyrimethanil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pyrimethanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 28 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control Botrytis cinerea in grape (wine), Venturia inaequalis in apples and Botrytis spp. in protein peas, respectively. The application rates are up to 1 kg pyrimethanil per hectare in grape (wine)(3) and up to 600 g per hectare in apples and protein peas. Pyrimethanil can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Scala"" (""CQ 1294"", ""EXP 10588A""), a suspension concentrate (SC), registered in most of the EU Member States. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pyrimethanil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Pyrimethanil is rapidly orally absorbed (70 - 80 %), and also quickly excreted. There is no potential for bioaccumulation. The metabolic degradation of pyrimethanil in rats occurs primarily via oxidation on one or both rings of the molecule and subsequent conjugation. Pyrimethanil has a low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. In short term toxicity studies in rats and mice, main target organs were liver (increased weight, histopathological changes) and thyroid (histopathological changes). In dogs, a dose-related marked decrease in water intake was observed. The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for short term toxicity is 5.4 mg/kg bw/day (90-days rat study). There is no evidence from the available studies of a mutagenic, genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of pyrimethanil. The relevant oral NOAEL for long term toxicity is 17.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. Pyrimethanil did not show any adverse effects on reproduction parameters. Pyrimethanil is not teratogenic. No signs of neurotoxicity were observed in any test. Supplementary studies were conducted with the soil metabolite AE F132593. The metabolite was of moderate acute oral toxicity and was found of no genotoxic potential and it can be considered of no toxicological relevance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that enhanced hepatic metabolism induced by pyrimethanil resulted in an increased thyroid hormone clearance resulting in a chronic stimulation of the thyroid. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.17 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study with a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the overall NOAEL of 17.4 mg/kg bw/day from the collective results of the 90-day and the 104 week rat study. An additional correction factor was applied due to the limited enteral absorption rate of approx. 72%. From the evaluation of the available toxicological data base of pyrimethanil it was concluded that there is no need to establish an acute reference dos (ARfD). Based on the results of an in vitro study with human skin samples performed with a SC-formulation, a dermal absorption rate of pyrimethanil of 1% for the concentrate and 20% for the spray dilution was proposed for human risk assessment. According to UK POEM model as well as German BBA model the estimated operator exposure for most of the intended uses is below the AOEL only when appropriate PPE (gloves, coverall) is considered. The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL. The metabolism of pyrimethanil has been investigated in a large range of crops and it was shown that the parent compound is forming the major part of the residue even for PHI as long as 42 days. The metabolites identified do not cause any concern due to their nature and their amount. The residue definition in plant commodities can be limited to pyrimethanil for both monitoring and risk assessment. The supervised residue trials submitted are sufficient to propose the setting of MRLs at 1 and 3 mg/kg for apples and wine grapes respectively. Pyrimethanil is not degraded under processing conditions. The transfer factors to wine, apple juice and puree are below 1, indicating that the compound is preferably transferred to the non food processed fractions. Under field conditions the presence of residues of pyrimethanil and its metabolites in rotational crops is limited to low amounts below 0.05 mg/kg and do not represent a significant toxicological burden. In cattle pyrimethanil is extensively metabolised and 2 metabolites were identified as major (2-(4-hydroxyanilino)-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine and 2-anilino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-5-ol), but their presence at measurable levels under practical condition, taking into account the exposure of livestock through apple pomace and protein peas, can be excluded. Therefore no residue definition for animal commodities is needed. No dietary risk was identified due to residues resulting from the use of pyrimethanil according to the representative uses in apples, wine grapes and protein peas supported by the manufacturer. Pyrimethanil is moderate to medium persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. The major transformation product was 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine. This metabolite is moderate to high persistent in soil. Mineralization after 90 -100 d was in the range of 4 - 7 % AR and the bounded residues reached levels between 42 - 62 % AR. The half lives used on the FOCUS ground water modelling were derived from a separated kinetic multicompartmental analysis with TopFit 2.0. Degradation is much slower under anaerobic conditions (DT50 > 300 d). Dissipation in field trials in Germany confirms that pyrimethanil is a moderate persistent substance in soil (DT50 field = 23 54 d). PEC soil were calculated for the representative uses based on worst case field half life (DT50 = 54 d). As metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine was not detected in field studies the PECmax in soil was estimated from the LOD (LOD <= 0.02 mg/kg). Pyrimethanil is low to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 75 751 mL / g) and 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine is medium to high mobile in soil (K-oc = 56 240 mL / g). A three years lysimeter study in Germany on two lysimeters with vines is available. No pyrimethanil was found in both lysimeters at any sampling date. Most of the radioactivity in the leachate was found as not extractable from the water phase. Pyrimethanil is hydrolytically stable in sterile buffer solutions at environmental relevant pH and temperature. Direct photolysis does not contribute to the environmental degradation of pyrimethanil in water. Pyrimethanil is not ready biodegradable. Degradation of pyrimethanil in dark aerobic water environment at 20 degrees C was investigated in two water sediment systems. Dissipation of pyrimethanil from the water phase took place with half lives of 8.9 and 24 d, mainly due to adsorption to the sediment. Degradation in the whole system proceeds slowly (DT50 whole system = 40 121 d or DT50 whole system = 29 114 d with TopFit multicompartmental kinetic evaluation) with the formation of 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine (max 10.4 % AR after 100 d in the whole system) and the formation of non extractable sediment residues (max 27.3 47.7 % AR). Mineralization was low to moderate (CO2 = 2.4 9.1 % AR). PECSW and PECSED were calculated using the Top Fit derived kinetic constants assuming the application pattern proposed in the table of GAP for the representative uses but only including the spray drift route of entry to surface water. Worst case parameters were selected in the calculation. Peak concentration reached after repeated applications were taken as initial PECSW / PECSED for the risk assessment. Member States should assess the potential for soil residues to reach surface water as a result of the drainage and runoff. Potential for ground water contamination was assessed for pyrimethanil and metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine based on FOCUS PELMO 1.1.1. The trigger of 0.1 mu g/L was not exceeded for any of the nine scenarios neither by pyrimethanil nor by the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine. Significant volatilization from leave surface (27 %) and soil surface (10 %) was observed in the study provided. However, the potential for photochemical degradation of pyrimethanil in air is high (DT50 air Atkinson = 1.8 h), indicating very low potential for long transport in air. The acute and short term risk to birds can be regarded as low for all the representative uses evaluated. Also the long term risk to birds for the representative uses in apples and protein peas and the long term risk to large herbivorous birds in grapes can be regarded as low. The long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes is high in the first tier risk assessment but based on a weight of evidence approach the EPCO experts' meeting considered the long term risk to insectivorous birds in grapes addressed. The acute risk to mammals is considered to be low but a potential high long term risk to mammals was identified in the first tier risk assessment for all representative uses evaluated. After refinement of these assessments, the long term risk to mammals can be regarded as low for all representative uses evaluated. The EPCO experts' meeting agreed to refine the long term risk to mammals for the use in apples for Annex I inclusion based on the diet composition data for voles as no such data for the most appropriate focal species wood mouse was available. Particular attention should be paid at MS level on the choice of focal species to refine the long term risk to mammals in orchards. The risk to aquatic organisms is driven by the chronic risk to fish. The EPCO experts' meeting did not accept the available fish ELS study and set a data gap for a new fish ELS study and in addition considered an argumentation for the use of the PECtwa-value necessary. Based on the next most pivotal endpoint the risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in protein peas and vines can be considered as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. For the representative uses in apple orchards the risk can be regarded as low if risk mitigation measures such as a 10 meter buffer zone are taken into account. The EFSA would like to point out that the risk to aquatic organisms can only be concluded once the new fish ELS study becomes available and that most likely more risk mitigation measures will be needed once this study becomes available. The risk for bioconcentration in fish from the metabolite AE F132593 cannot be concluded as the LogPow is not known. Therefore the EFSA proposes a data requirement for the notifier to make the LogPow of AE F132593 available. The risk to bees and non-target arthropods can be regarded as low. The acute risk to earthworms can be regarded as low. Also the long term risk to earthworms for the uses in protein peas and grapes can be regarded as low but a high long term risk to earthworms from the use in apple orchards was identified. The refinement of this risk was not accepted by the EPCO expert's meeting and therefore the meeting set a further data gap for an additional long term toxicity study to earthworms with the lead formulation Scala with more doses and lower organic material. Furthermore a long term study on earthworms with the soil metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is requested. No adverse effects on organic matter breakdown are expected from pyrimethanil from the representative uses evaluated. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms from the lead formulation Scala is considered to be low, but a study on soil micro-organisms with the metabolite 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine is still required. The risk from pyrimethanil on non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low for all representative uses evaluated.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.63r,"Phosalone is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosalone in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 7 May 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 6 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Cheminova A/S. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April -May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 29 November 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control chewing and sucking insects in pome fruit (apples, pears) at application rate up to 900 g per hectare. Phosalone can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It should be noted that only the use as insecticide was supported for the EU review programme. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Zolone"" (Rubitox; ""AE F016629 00 EC A1xx""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of phosalone. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Phosalone was found to have a very high acute toxicity when tested by the oral route, and is harmful after acute dermal and inhalative application. It is minimally irritating to skin and eyes and has sensitising properties. The classification proposed is: T, R 25 ""Toxic if swallowed""; Xn, R 20/21 ""Harmful by inhalation and in contact with skin""; Xi, R 43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, the main effect identified was cholinesterase inhibition. Data for phosalone do not support evidence of genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The estimated operator exposure according to the German model is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment is used. The metabolism of phosalone has been investigated in fruits. The metabolism is rather limited and all metabolites formed were found at low levels. Phosalone is the dominant compound of the residue and the residue definition for monitoring is proposed to be phosalone only. One metabolite, oxophosalone, anticipated to be at least as toxic as the parent compound, is included in the residue definition for risk assessment. This metabolite should be toxicologically characterized. Supervised residue trials in apples and pears were submitted, allowing a MRL proposal of 2 mg/kg for pome fruits. The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Although studies in buffer solution demonstrated an extensive degradation under conditions simulating baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosalone seems to be stable under practical conditions of production of apple juice and puree. The reasons for this have not been fully elucidated. The transfer factors to apple juice and puree are very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions. One degradation product observed after processing in buffer solution needs to be investigated for its toxicological relevance as it was not identified in the rat metabolism (2-amino-7chloro- 3H-phenoxazin-3-one). As the intended uses are restricted to pome fruits, studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required. Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosalone through consumption of pomace. Metabolism studies in lactating goat indicated that phosalone is not found in animal tissues. Only metabolites could be identified. The information obtained from the metabolism study in livestock is not sufficient to propose a residue definition and further information is needed on the identification of major residues in animal matrices. From the data submitted it may be expected that some metabolites may be present at measurable levels in animal tissues. The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures to phosalone only. The potential contribution of oxophosalone to the toxicological burden as well as of residues present in animal commodities is not known at this stage. Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn. Considering phosalone only, the acute and chronic exposure assessments, made according to current guidelines, give results below the ADI but may exceed in some cases the ARfD. However, the level of the proposed MRL in pome fruits, which is significantly lower than the level considered in exposure assessments, causes concern in terms of consumer safety. The acute exposure of toddlers may lead to higher exceedance of the ARfD for samples in compliance with the proposed MRL but with high unit to unit variability of residues. Under aerobic conditions phosalone is rapidly metabolised in soil, initially to many minor metabolites, and ultimately to CO2 and soil bound residues. The extensive formation of soil bound residues is rapid and is due in part to the formation of metabolites containing functional groups which are rapidly and tightly bound to organic matter in soil. Under anaerobic conditions the major metabolite AE F114970 (2-amino-5-chlorophenol) was found in the water phase. Phosalone can be classified as very low to low persistent and low to slight mobile in soil. Modelling for the representative uses evaluated indicated that phosalone is unlikely to contaminate groundwater when used as recommended. If released in water, phosalone would adsorb to sediment and particulate matter in the water column and photolysed in the surface layers. Phosalone is relatively stable to transformation by hydrolysis at pH 4 and pH 7, but it is hydrolyzed at pH 9 to metabolites AE0941954 (S-6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2oxo- benzoxazol-3-ylmethyl and AE F054014 (6-chloro-2(3H)-benzoxazolone). Another major metabolite, AE 0651017 (=RP18726, phenoxazone) was found in the water phase of the sediment/water study. PECsw were recalculated based on a safety factor for DT50 value derived from experimental data in order to take into account the pH dependency for hydrolysis of phosalone. PECsw and PECsed calculations for phosalone and metabolite AE 0651017 were based on the critical GAP from the table of representative uses and spray drift loadings. As additional information, contribution to surface water contamination via runoff and drainage was assessed with Exposit model and included in an addendum. Concentration of phosalone in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. A high long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds, considering the blue tit as a focal species. A high acute risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals and a long-term risk to small and medium sized herbivorous mammals, insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. Additionally a high risk was identified for the aquatic environment. Even with a buffer zone of 50 m the TER values are below the agreed trigger value for an available microcosm study. The risk to honey bees is high and risk mitigation measures should be set at Member State level also for flowering weeds below trees in orchards. The available studies indicate a high potential risk to non-target arthropods, both in-field and off-field. Even if phosalone residues on vegetation can be assumed to degrade relatively rapidly allowing for recolonisation, the off- field risk has to be addressed and further data e.g. a field study with predatory mites under the intended conditions is required. Risk mitigation measures at Member State level to protect off- field non-target parasitoids are proposed. Furthermore a new study on one additional arthropod species is required. The acute risk to earthworms is considered low. However, sublethal effects were observed in the acute studies and therefore a long-term reproduction study is required to make sure that phosalone does not cause unacceptable effects on earthworm reproduction. The risk to soil micro organisms, non-target flora and fauna and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is considered low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ethoprophos,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.66r,"Ethoprophos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on ethoprophos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 19 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience (the original notification was made by Aventis CropScience which merged with Bayer AG in 2002 to form Bayer CropScience).. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues, as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide, as proposed by the applicant. This comprises direct overall or band/row application followed by soil incorporation to control a broad spectrum of insects and nematodes in potatoes at application rate up 11 kg ethoprophos per hectare. Ethoprophos can be used as insecticide and nematicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mocap 10G"" (""AE F034142 00 FG10 A1"" or ""EXP05806A""), a granule formulation (GR), registered in the South and the North of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air. A validated analytical method for the determination of ethoprophos in blood and animal tissues is also available. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Ethoprophos has a high acute toxicity and is a skin sensitizer. The proposal for classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed""; Xi, R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The most sensitive endpoint during short term exposure was cholinesterase inhibition in all species. Considering available evidence, there is no genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The classification Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"", based on the high mortality in the first weeks of the long term rat study, is proposed. There is no evidence of reproductive toxicity, and ethoprophos was not shown to be teratogenic. Delayed neurotoxicity in acute studies with hens has not been demonstrated. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. All reference values were set using a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption value of 10% represents a worst case assumption. The measurements of operator exposure in a field study are above the AOEL, even assuming the use of personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. Only the use of Surefill containers might reduce the extent of exposure below the AOEL. Based on an air monitoring study, worker and bystander exposure are clearly below the AOEL. The metabolism of ethoprophos in plants after soil application has been investigated in potatoes, cabbage and sweet corn. The degradation involves the hydrolysis of the S-propyl and O-ethyl ester links and further degradation to compounds later integrated in the structure of natural plant components. The major metabolite observed in plants is ethyl phosphate. This compound has no toxicological relevance. Other compounds were identified at lower levels: EPPA (O-ethyl-S-propylphosphorothioate), OME (O-ethyl-O-methyl-S-propyl-phosphorothioate) and SME (O-Ethyl-Smethyl- S-propyl-phosphorothioate). These metabolites have a level of toxicity similar to that of ethoprophos. In rotational crops metabolism data suggest a similar degradation pathway. A residue definition for risk assessment is proposed as the sum of ethoprophos, EPPA, OME and SME expressed as ethoprophos. This definition is proposed taking the available information on all crops into consideration because the data on potato tubers are not conclusive enough for a reliable residue definition for that crop. The residue definition for monitoring purposes is ethoprophos only. Supervised residue trials on potatoes were conducted in accordance with the representative uses supported by the notifier. They lead to a proposal for a MRL of 0.02 mg/kg for potatoes, covering potatoes harvested in an early stage of their growth to be specifically marketed as small size potatoes. These trials were carried out with analysis of ethoprophos only and therefore are not appropriate to be used for risk assessment for the health of the consumer. Additional supervised residue trials in potatoes are necessary with analysis of residues according to the residue definition for risk assessment. Such studies are currently ongoing and a first set of results has already been submitted to the RMS. Before finalising acute and chronic risk assessments, further information on the nature of extractable residues in rotational crops and, depending on that information, field trials on rotational crops are also necessary. Due to the very low exposure of livestock to residues of ethoprophos, residues in animal commodities are expected to be extremely low and do not need to be monitored and taken into consideration for assessment of the risk for the health of the consumer. The route of degradation in soil of ethoprophos was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using ethyl-or propyl-labelled compound. Ethoprophos was degraded to the minor metabolite Oethyl- S-propylphosphorothioic acid (AE 0592496) with final degradation products CO2 and unextracted residues. The route of degradation of ethoprophos under anaerobic conditions was comparable to that under aerobic conditions. The rate of degradation under laboratory conditions indicate that ethoprophos is moderately to highly persistent in soil. There is some indication (1 laboratory and two field soils) that at the low end of the soil pH range (pH 5.3 and 4.5) ethoprophos may degrade more slowly. Adsorption studies have shown that ethoprophos has very high to medium potential for mobility in soil. These data combined with groundwater modelling, indicate under European conditions there is generally a negligible risk that ethoprophos will reach ground water when applied in accordance with usual Good Agricultural Practice for potatoes, except when grown in vulnerable scenarios (i. e. FOCUS groundwater scenarios of Piacenza and Hamburg). Chemical hydrolysis and photodegradation are not considered to be relevant degradation pathways under natural environmental conditions. The metabolic pattern in water/sediment system under aerobic conditions was similar to that observed in soil. In sediment with high organic carbon content, up to 44% of ethoprophos partitioning to sediment can be observed. Estimated concentrations of ethoprophos in surface water, arising from sub surface flow, indicate that except in very vulnerable situations, there is no cause for concern. Concentrations of ethoprophos in the air compartment will be negligible, due to the method of application (soil incorporation) and short persistence in the atmosphere. There were no major metabolites identified in any of the fate and behaviour studies. The consumption of contaminated soil organisms (earthworms) and systemic residues in volunteer plants growing in potato fields were assumed as the main routes of exposure for birds and mammals. Uptake of granules as grit was identified to be a main route of exposure for birds. The acute risk, short-term risk and long term-risk to small granivorous birds from intentional uptake of granules is high. Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i. e. ethoprophos in food of plant origin (potatoes, only) in soil, water and air. A validated analytical method for the determination of ethoprophos in blood and animal tissues is also available. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues.

Further risk refinement steps and risk mitigation measures to ensure high incorporation efficiency are required. The refined acute risk assessment for herbivorous birds is low but needs further support by data. The short term risk and the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were considered to be low. A high acute, short-term and long-term risk to earthworm eating birds was indicated and further data are required to support the suggested risk refinement steps. The acute and long-term risk to herbivorous mammals such as the hare was assessed as low. The long-term risk to earthworm eating mammals is high. Further risk refinement steps are required. The chronic risk to aquatic invertebrates and the potential risk of bioaccumulation is high under vulnerable conditions where contamination of surface water arises. The study with Chironomus riparius needs to be evaluated in order to draw a final conclusion on the risk to sediment dwelling organisms. A potential risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms was identified if contamination of aquatic habitats arises. For conditions where contamination of surface water arises the risk of biomagnification in aquatic food chains and the risk of secondary poisoning of fish eating birds and mammals needs to be addressed. Severe acute and sublethal effects were observed in tests with non-target arthropods and a high risk was indicated. The higher tier risk assessment for non-target arthropods was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was concluded that the potential of recovery was sufficiently demonstrated taking into account that the field margins remain unaffected and thus providing a reservoir for recolonisation. A high acute and long-term risk was indicated for earthworms in the first tier risk assessment. In a field study severe acute effects were observed. However the effects full recovery was observed within 5 months after the application and it is concluded that the risk to earthworms is sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target flora and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dichlorprop-P,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.52r,"Dichlorprop-P is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EUCommission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dichlorprop-P in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 5 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 13 February 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the dichlorprop-P Task Force which originally consisted of BASF AG, Aventis Crop Science (now Bayer Crop Science) and A H Marks Co. Ltd. On 20 February 2004, the Task Force membership changed. BASF and Bayer CropScience effectively divested their Task Force positions to Nufarm bv. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in July 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January-March 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 30 September 2005 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in cereals, grassland and grass seed crops at an application rate of 1.5 kg dichlorprop-P per hectare. Dichlorprop-P can be used only as herbicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""DP-P K 600"" (""Optica DP""), a soluble concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. In the formulation the active substance is present as the potassium salt variant. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Whether or not sufficient enforcement methods are available to monitor food of plant and animal origin depends on the final residue definition. The reason is that none of the submitted method is enantio selective. The residues are determined as a sum parameter of both, the R-and the S-isomer. This means that for the determination of dichlorprop-P no specific enforcement method would be available. The methodologies used are GC with MS detection and HPLC with UV detection. None of them is enantio selective. A multi-residue method like the Dutch MM1 or the German S19 is not applicable to due the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical method as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Dichlorprop-P is extensively and rapidly absorbed after oral administration in rats (>88% based on urinary and faecal excretion). It is of moderate oral toxicity and low dermal toxicity as well as after inhalatory exposure. Dichlorprop-P was found to be non-irritant to the skin of rabbits but it is a severe eye irritant. Therefore, classification with Xi; R41 (Risk of serious damage to eyes) and R22 (Harmful if swallowed) is justified. It is not a skin sensitiser. Dichlorprop-P is of no genotoxic concern and does not show any carcinogenic potential. Furthermore, it does not induce reproduction toxic or neurotoxic effects. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.35 mg/kg bw/day, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day, all with a safety factor of 100 applied. The exposure estimates for workers and bystanders is below the AOEL. The metabolism of dichlorprop-P has been studied in cereals. In straw unchanged dichlorprop-P accounted for the majority of total radioactivity at maturity, whereas no further work on identification or characterisation of grain residue was performed due to low extractable residue levels. Two major metabolites were found in straw. One of them, metabolite 11 was not identified in the study and therefore its toxicological relevance could not be addressed. Further data on the identity of that metabolite were required (data gap). The residue definition for risk assessment was agreed by the experts' meeting for residues as sum of dichlorprop-P, its salts and conjugates expressed as dichlorprop-P. Based on information of potential conversion of dichloprop-P residues to the S-isomer, which became available after the experts' meeting the residue definition for consumer risk assessment would need to be reconsidered not only in terms of relevance of metabolite 11. In supervised residue trials the sum of the R-and the S-isomer of dichlorprop was determined, however, it still needs to be clarified whether also conjugates that are part of the residue definition have been analysed in those trials. A livestock metabolism study in lactating goats indicated that residues above LOQ could occur in edible animal matrices, and thus a feeding study on ruminants is required (data gap). Due to the lack of the above stated information and data the consumer risk assessment cannot currently be concluded. However, a provisional assessment of consumer risk with currently proposed MRLs for cereals, which are still pending their confirmation, indicates that consumer exposure is low for all considered consumer groups (significantly less than 10% ADI and ARfD, respectively). Exposure from food of animal origin has not been considered in the assessment. Under aerobic conditions in soil, no degradation products of dichlorprop-P that accounted for more than 10% AR were identified. Non-extractable residues reached a maximum of 33.6% AR and CO2 maximum of 43.4% AR. Under anaerobic conditions in a water/ sediment system no new metabolites were identified. Dichlorprop-P can be considerate as moderate persistent in soil. During the peer review process, experts decided to address a general question to the PPR Scientific Panel on the use of a Q10 value based on measured data in place of the FOCUS default value of 2.2 for temperature correction of DT50 values. However, in this case the Q10 of 5 was accepted. Only initial PECsoil values are used in the ecotoxicological risk assessment. The batch soil adsorption/desorption studies indicate that dichlorprop-P is potentially mobile. Modelling and a lysimeter study for the representative uses evaluated indicated that dichlorprop-P is unlikely to contaminate groundwater when used as recommended. Also monitoring data in 3 different countries in EU (UK, Germany and Denmark) showed that dichlorprop-P occurrence in groundwater as well as in surface fresh water is rare. Dichlorprop-P is expected to be stable to hydrolysis at environmental relevant pH. Photolysis can contribute to the degradation of dichlorprop-P in the environment. 2,4-dichlorophenol was the only identified metabolite (max. 23.6% day 8) in soil. Scientific literature demonstrated that 2,4dichlorophenol is degraded by soil micro-organism in less than 10 days. However, due to its pesticidal activity, the potential groundwater contamination for 2,4-dichlorophenol should be assessed. Dichlorprop-P should be classified as a non ready biodegradable substance. In water/sediment systems dichlorprop-P was degraded to 5.1 and 2.3% AR in the water phase and reached maximum levels of 11.9% AR and 10.3% AR in the sediment. The maximum amounts of sediment residue that was not extracted were up to 25.4% AR and 16.0% AR (day 30). The remaining amount was recovered as volatiles (more than 80% AR two months after application). The amount of dichlorprop-P in the system was 0.1% AR or less at the end of the study. PECsw due to contamination via spray drift were calculated for dichlorprop-P for a 30 cm deep static water body at 1 m distance for the evaluated representative use on spring cereals. PECsed values are not included in the endpoints since they are not relevant for the risk assessment. Concentration of dichlorprop-P in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. A high short term risk has been identified for herbivorous birds and a high acute risk for mammals for the use of dichlorprop-P in grass and grass seed crops. Additionally a potential high acute risk to insectivorous bird was identified considering the yellow wagtail as a representative species consuming 100% small insects as a worst case. Further data is thus needed to address the risk to birds and mammals. Additionally, a provisional data requirement was set to address the acute risk for both uses, pending the opinion of the PPR panel concerning the use of dietary short-term endpoint for the acute assessment. The opinion for pirimicarb was adopted in July 20053 and it is proposed by the EFSA that a risk assessment is performed in accordance with the recommendations provided in this opinion. The diatom algae Navicula pelliculosa was the most sensitive of the aquatic species tested with dichlorprop-P. The predicted environmental concentration in surface water was calculated based on spray drift. The TER value for algae indicates a high risk and risk mitigation measures comparable to 5 m buffer zones are required. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and other soil organism is considered low. To protect non-target plants outside the field risk mitigation measures comparable to a 5 m buffer zone is required.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fipronil,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.65r,"Fipronil is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fipronil in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 10 February 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 15 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises seed dressing to control soil insects and wireworms in sunflower and maize at application rate up 30 g fipronil per hectare for sunflower (up to 500 g fipronil per 100 kg seeds) and up to 50 g per hectare for maize (up to 250 g per 100 kg seeds), respectively. It should be noted that due to the fact that the applicant has changed, some representative uses are not longer supported for the EU review by the new applicant. Fipronil can be used as insecticide and acaricide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use as insecticide will be supported in the EU review programme. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Regent 500FS"" (""EXP80415A""), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), registered in some Member States of the EU. The WG-and the GB formulation (EXP60720A and EXP61840A, respectively) are not longer supported for the EU review process (i.e. with respect to Annex I inclusion) by the new applicant. However, the submitted data package was evaluated in the DAR, but the peer review was not completed. Adequate methods to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition are available only for food and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-residue method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of fipronil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Rapidly and extensively absorbed and distributed, fipronil may bioaccumulate but is readily metabolised, and slowly excreted via faeces. Fipronil is toxic by oral, inhalation and dermal acute exposure. It is slightly skin and eye irritating, and weakly sensitising, but not sufficiently to be classified. The proposed classification is T, R23/24/25 ""Toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed"". Adverse effects in the short term studies are observed in the central nervous system, liver and thyroid. The proposed classification by ECB is T, R48/25 ""Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"", to be voted in the 30th ATP. No genotoxic or carcinogenic potential is demonstrated. The mechanism for induction of thyroid tumours was discussed by the experts and considered rat specific and not relevant to humans. Neither reproductive or developmental toxicity is observed. In specific neurotoxicity studies, no histopathological findings are observed in the nervous system. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0035 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.009 mg/kg bw, with a safety factor of 100. As the use of the Seed Tropex model was considered not fully appropriate by the experts, the operator exposure was evaluated with a field study, resulting in an exposure below the AOEL without PPE. Worker exposure is 89% of the AOEL without PPE, for a 8-hour working day. Bystander exposure is not likely to be an issue for seed treatments and has to be addressed at Member State level. The metabolism of fipronil has been investigated on five different crops representative for cereals, pulses and oilseed, roots and tubers using either soil applications or seed treatment. A common metabolic pathway could be defined for the three crop groups tested and a relevant metabolite (sulfone metabolite MB 46136) was demonstrated to be present. Even though there were concerns on an acutely toxic by oral administration photo degradation product of fipronil, MB 46513, the experts' meeting on residues concluded that the compound is basically not relevant in relation to seed treatment uses. However, a label restriction has been proposed to ensure that treated seed remains stored in the dark to prevent photo degradation processes. In supervised residue trails no residues of fipronil and of its sulfone metabolite were observed at harvest of maize grain and sunflower seed. Trials results are suitable to propose MRLs at LOQ level. Even though calculated animal intakes were well below the trigger of 0.1 mg/kg, there is a need to consider residues in animal products since fipronil is classified fat soluble and the ADI is very low. Based on the available livestock metabolism and feeding studies, MRLs for food of animal origin were proposed. In a consumer risk assessment the TMDI was demonstrated to exceed the ADI for toddlers and infants, mainly due to the fact that milk consumption accounted for the most significant contribution of pesticide intake in terms of the total dietary assessment. However, in a refined chronic dietary risk assessment the IEDI/NEDI was below the ADI for all considered consumer groups (adults, toddles, infants) and thus, it is unlikely that exposure to fipronil and fipronil sulfone residues from seed treatment will pose a high chronic risk to consumers. In an acute dietary risk assessment the estimated exposure of all considered consumer groups was well below the proposed ARfD. Under laboratory aerobic conditions fipronil is moderate to high persistent in soil. Major metabolites are the amide RPA 200766(3), the sulphone MB 46136(4) and the sulphide MB 45950(5). Mineralization is very low. Under dark aerobic conditions at metabolite RPA 20076(6) is high persistent, RPA 200761(6) moderate to high persistent, MB 45950 medium to high persistent, MB 46136 high persistent and MB 46513(7) moderate to medium persistent. Most of the measured half lives are longer than the duration of the studies and therefore uncertain. Photolysis may contribute slightly to the environmental dissipation of fipronil in soil yielding two metabolites not previously detected in the dark aerobic degradation studies: MB 46513 (more acutely orally toxic than fipronil) and RPA 104615(8). Available field studies confirmed that fipronil is medium to high persistent in soil when not exposed to light (soil incorporated). When exposed to light the toxic metabolite MB 46513 is detected. Two field accumulation studies were submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. A clear tendency for accumulation of fipronil metabolites is demonstrated. Plateau for metabolites had not been reached after the five or six years of repeated applications. The PEC soil calculation submitted by the applicant after the DAR was finalised do not represents a worst case with respect to the parent compound. Furthermore, the assumptions taken in the calculation are not well justified. Calculation of the initial and 21 d TWA-PECS for the parent compound and soil metabolites are also needed to finalise the ecotoxicological risk assessment. According adsorption / desorption studies fipronil is low to medium mobile, MB 45950 and MB 46136 are immobile to low mobile, MB 46513 is low mobile and RPA 200766 is medium to high mobile. Hydrolysis will not contribute to the degradation of fipronil in the environment. However, photolysis may contribute to the degradation of fipronil and its major metabolites in water. Fipronil is not readily biodegradable in water. In water/sediment system fipronil is adsorbed on the sediment where degrades to MB 45950. In the water phase fipronil and the major metabolite RPA 200766 reached levels above 10 % AR. PECSW/SED were provided by the applicant after the DAR was finalised. However, new calculations are needed with parameters updated following FOCUS guidance. New PECGW were provided by the applicant after the DAR had been finalized. Only the application rate of 50 g/ha for maize has been simulated. Results of these new calculations show that metabolite RPA 200766 exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for five of the seven scenarios simulated. This metabolite has been assessed to be not toxicological relevant (see 2.8) but it is considered ecotoxicological relevant (see 5.2). Due to the deviations with respect to guidelines on the input parameters selection and the need of justification for the use of field kinetic parameters a data gap for new FOCUS PECGW calculation with appropriate input parameters has been identified. Long range transport and deposition of fipronil may be considered negligible. A high acute, short and long term risks to granivorous birds were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. The risk to birds should focus on the acute and short term risk as there is no indication that fipronil is a reproductive toxin. A new risk assessment for granivorous birds taking into account the concerns raised at the EPCO 27 experts' meeting is required. The risk to small and large granivorous birds must be quantified. The current proposed extrapolation from maize to sunflowers is not acceptable. Also for granivorous mammals a high acute and long term risk were identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower. A revised risk assessment for granivorous mammals taking into account the concerns raised at EPCO 27 is required. The availability of treated seeds for mammals should be assessed to indicate whether mice consumed drilled maize and sunflower seeds. The risk to granivorous birds and mammals from the use of fipronil as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can only be concluded once recently submitted data are evaluated. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the representative uses of fipronil as a seed dressing is considered to be low. The risk to earthworm and fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered low based on the currently available PECs and PECsw-values. The risk to earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PEC in surface water and soil. The risk to aquatic organisms is based on the most sensitive species, Mysidopsis bahia. If the applicant would like to pursue the argument that marine species are more sensitive than freshwater species then a more robust justification must be provided. The risk to aquatic organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsw values. Based on the available provisional PECsw values a high acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms was identified for the representative use as a seed treatment in maize. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative use in sunflower can be regarded as low. The RMS proposed to refine the long term risk by using an endpoint for M. bahia from a study in the presence of sediment. The EFSA considers that in order to accept this refinement option, an assessment in line with the conclusion of the PPR Panel on dimoxystrobin should be presented. The experts' meeting agreed that it might be possible to reduce the standard uncertainty factor due to the number of species tested. The EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel regarding the reduction of the uncertainty due to the availability of several single species studies and proposes to take this opinion into account at MS-level. Based on the present PECsw values the risk from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower can be regarded as low except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates from MB 46136 in maize. Also for the refinement of this risk the EFSA would like to refer to the opinion of the PPR Panel on the lowering of aquatic trigger values. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fipronil is considered to be low. The EFSA proposes that a study on bioaccumulation in fish from the metabolites MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 should be submitted as the Log Pow of these metabolites exceeds 3. A very high acute contact and oral toxicity of fipronil to bees were observed in the laboratory toxicity studies. The metabolite MB 46136 showed a similar toxicity to bees as fipronil and the metabolite RPA 200761 showed a lower toxicity to bees than fipronil. The EPCO experts' meeting considered the risk to adult bees for the representative uses as a seed treatment in maize and sunflower addressed based on the low exposure situation observed in monitoring studies and the observation of no adverse effects in the tunnel studies. The risk to bees can only be concluded once recently submitted data on the risk to bee brood are evaluated. Furthermore the EFSA would like to highlight that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and MS should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country. A high toxicity to NTA was observed in the laboratory. The EPCO experts' meeting identified the need for a new risk assessment for soil dwelling arthropods taking into account final results from the ongoing aged residue studies on A. bilineata and F. candida. This assessment should cover the potential for recovery of impacted species in the field. Furthermore the meeting noted that the risk assessment should cover the plateau soil PEC for total residues (parent + metabolites). The risk to non-target arthropods from the representative uses with the FS formulation can only be concluded once recently submitted studies on A. bilineata and F. candida are evaluated and the open questions for the calculation of PECsoil have been solved. The risk to soil macro-organisms can be considered low at a concentration of 0.785 mg a.s./kg soil and the risk to soil micro-organisms can be considered as low at a concentration of 0.667 mg a.s./kg soil for fipronil and 0.60, 0.133 and 0.267 mg/kg soil for MB 46136, MB 45950 and RPA 200766 respectively. The risk to soil non-target macro-and micro-organisms from the representative uses with the FS formulation can not be concluded due to still open questions regarding the calculation of PECsoil. The risk to earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cadusafos,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.68r,"Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative as insecticide and nematicide comprise the application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas and potatoes at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Cadusafos can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Ruby 200 CS"", a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos are registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition only for soil, water and air, i.e. cadusafos in soil, water and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Insufficient data are available for the determination of cadusafos in the technical material and in the representative formulation to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid, the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". The main effect after short term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat and rabbit teratology studies, no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw/day. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 6 kg a.s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL according to the currently used models which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation. The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The representative use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out. For the representative use on bananas, although 2 metabolism studies for this crop were submitted, the data are not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This is due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound. Therefore a new metabolism study in bananas is needed as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern. The compounds to be analysed in the residue trials should be determined on the basis of the results of the metabolism study. The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested. Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage. The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (<10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25(circle)C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile / water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at 2 consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, information on its mobility in soil is required to complete the groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite. In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-C-14 radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20(circle)C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. However MS would need to carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, as the available EU level assessment does not cover these situations. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for potatoes and the specifically parameterised scenario for bananas in Tenerife for parent cadusafos has not been carried out with appropriate soil DT50 or Henry's law parameters. The potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos. A groundwater leaching assessment for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone is triggered. It is not available. Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals. In the first tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use was not further considered. For the use in banana plantations a conclusion on the risk to birds and mammals can not be reached at this stage. The risk needs to be further addressed based on species that occur in banana plantations and their associated diets. Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water. The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil the risk is considered low. No in-field exposure of leaf dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. The available test with Poecilius cupreus was conducted at an application rate which is lower than the proposed. An ongoing study with Aleochara bilineata should be submitted for the use in banana due to the perceived low sensitivity of P. cupreus. For the application of cadusafos by drip-irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected. A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The ongoing field study conducted in United Kingdom should be submitted and the relevance for the proposed uses should be addressed. It should be noted that the application rate in this study is 4.5 kg cadusafos per hectare, which is below the proposed application rate for the intended uses. A study with Collembola and mites is required to address the risk to other soil macro-organisms. The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ethephon,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.174r/full,"Ethephon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on ethephon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 April 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 June 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 14 December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. In October 2006 an addendum on the ARfD prepared by the Netherlands was submitted to EFSA. This addendum has been discussed during the 4th round of PRAPeR expert meetings in the meeting on mammalian toxicology from 26 -30 March 2007. During the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health held on 19-20 May 2008 in Brussels the ARfD for ethephon was discussed and EFSA presented a paper to describe the ARfD setting process and the supporting studies evaluated so far in the peer review. It was concluded that the RMS should prepare a new addendum to the DAR to clearly describe and summarise all the available information for setting the ARfD. It was agreed to re-discuss the ARfD during the following round of PRAPeR expet meetings. This second addendum on the ARfD was prepared by the Netherlands and submitted to EFSA in June 2008, which was discussed during the 11th round of PRAPeR expert meetings in the meeting of mammalian toxicology from 7 -11 July 2008. The outcome of the different discussions is reflected in this document, which has been amended accordingly. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator comprise foliar spraying to regulate the growth of cereals (winter wheat; winter and spring barley) at an application rate of up to 480 g ethephon per hectare (""spring"": 360; ""winter"": 480). Ethephon can be used only as plant growth regulator. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Cerone"" (""EXP03725B"" or ""AE F013382 00 SL40""), a soluble concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in most of the Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It should be noted that due to data gaps it was not possible for the rapporteur Member State to conclude on the comparability of the technical materials from the second applicant. Ethephon has an oral LD50 of 1564 mg/kg bw, a dermal LD50 of 983 mg/kg bw and an inhalation LC50 of 3.26 mg/L. Ethephon causes severe skin irritation. Hence ethephon should be classified as CORROSIVE' with the associated risk phrases ['R20/21/22] 'Harmful by inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed' and [R34] 'Causes burns'. The applicability of R43' May cause sensitisation by skin contact' was forwarded to ECB. Ethephon is considered to be non-genotoxic and no oncogenic potential of the test substance in rats or mice was observed. There were no direct effects observed on reproductive performance or fertility. In the teratogenicity study in rabbits, no test material-related foetal variations or malformations were observed. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens. The ADI, and AOEL are 0.03 mg/kg bw/d, based on the 1-year dog study and supported by human data. A safety factor of 1000 was used including an extra factor of 10 since ChE activity was not measured in the study. Originally in 2005, the ARfD was also set at 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the same 1-year dog study and safety factor of 1000, however after the submission of a new oral 28-day dog study to investigate acetylcholinesterase inhibition, this value was revised in 2007 and 2008, and considering both the dog and human studies, the ARfD was set at 0.05 mg/kg bw. The estimated exposure of the operator and bystanders was below the AOEL without PPE; no worker exposure is anticipated for cereals. Following foliar application of ethephon to wheat, tomatoes and pineapple the major residue found at harvest in straw, grain, fruits and leaves, respectively, was ethephon or its metabolite 2-hydroxyethyl phosphonic acid (HEPA). Other metabolites were probably not formed. Since HEPA was present in cereals at equal levels as ethephon and was also considered toxicologically relevant, HEPA was included in the risk assessment for consumers. The experts' meeting for toxicology concluded that HEPA is even about twice more toxic than ethephon itself. However, upon receipt of late information from the applicant, the rapporteur Member State indicated during the final discussion in February 2006 that a reassessment of the potency of toxicity of HEPA might be needed. Fed to ruminants ethephon was intensively metabolised resulting in a low total residue. Based on the properties of the molecule and additional scientific literature on metabolism of acetate it was concluded, that ethephon and 2-hydroxyethyl phosphonic acid (HEPA) are the only possible metabolic intermediates in ruminants. No significant residue levels (ethephon and HEPA) are expected when livestock (ruminants/pigs) is exposed to residue resulting from ethephon application to cereals according the evaluated cGAP, and thus no MRLs are currently proposed for food of animal origin. Studies in poultry are not triggered by the representative uses, and therefore a residue definition and MRLs are currently not necessary for poultry products. A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are available to assess consumer exposure to the ethephon and HEPA, and to propose ethephon MRLs for wheat and barley grain as well as a conversion factor for risk assessment. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the representative GAP on cereals indicated that none of the considered consumer subgroups was exposed above 4 % of the proposed ADI and 2% of the ARfD, respectively. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that ethephon is not persistent in the environment. Under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, ethephon degraded in soil with a half-life in the range from 2.7 to 37.6 days, depending on the soil type and the pH of the soil. The major degradates are ethylene gas and the non-volatile 2-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid (the latter formed at amount < 10% AR by microbially mediated hydrolytic dehalogenation). The major routes of dissipation appear to be chemical hydrolysis and microbial degradation. Degradation in soil is slightly enhanced by irradiation. Ethephon can be characterized as having moderate to low mobility in soil. Modelling indicated that ethephon is unlikely to contaminate groundwater when used as recommended. In the field, ethephon exhibited the same characteristics (fairly rapid degradation and moderate to low mobility) as those seen in the laboratory. Ethephon was stable to hydrolysis in acidic sterilized water, but did rapidly hydrolyze in neutral and alkaline environments. Irradiation resulted also in the hydrolysis of ethephon with ethylene as degradation product. In water and sediment, ethephon disappeared rapidly by hydrolysis in the water phase and only small quantities of the compound were adsorbed to the sediment. Ethephon is considered non ready biodegradable. PECsw and PECsed estimations were performed based on drift as the entry route into a static water layer 30 cm deep, a distance of 1, 5 and 10 meters. Concentrations of ethephon in air are expected to be negligible. The risk insectivorous birds and mammals in cereals can be regarded as low as well as the risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning and from consumption of contaminated drinking water. The risk to aquatic organisms is regarded to be low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to bees and other arthropod species can be regarded as low based on the available studies. The risk to earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms and soil micro-organisms can be regarded as low. The risk to non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dichlorvos,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.77r/full,"Dichlorvos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dichlorvos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 20 October 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 21 June 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Denka International B.V. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005.Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 5 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide comprise room treatment (by using fogging vaporising equipment) to protect flower bulbs from thrips. The application rate is 2.2 g dichlorvos per 100 m(3) with maximal 3 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 6.6 g/100 m(3). Dichlorvos can be used as acaricide and insecticide. It should be noted that the applicant stated that only the use as insecticide will be supported in the EU review programme. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "" Dichlorvos 550 g/EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered in some Member States of the EU. No methods are available to monitor the compounds given in the respective residue definition for soil water and air. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Dichlorvos is toxic following acute oral and dermal exposure and very toxic after acute inhalation exposure. It is expected to be slightly irritating to the skin and eyes. Dichlorvos was found to have a skin sensitizing potential. The following classification was proposed: R25 Toxic if swallowed, R24 Toxic in contact with skin, R26 Very toxic by inhalation, R43 May cause sensitization by skin contact. Dichlorvos did not pose any concern for reproductive and developmental toxicity. Based on the available data, no delayed neuropathy was observed. A question addressing the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of dichlorvos was proposed to be forwarded to the EFSA PPR panel due to the weaknesses of data provided, not adequate to exclude carcinogenic activity. Therefore information and expertise was considered insufficient for the setting of reference values and accordingly the operator exposure calculations, was not considered appropriate until the outcome of the EFSA PPR panel discussions. The PPR opinion3 has been adopted on 1 April 2006. Taking the conclusions in the opinion into consideration it was agreed at the meeting with Member State's representatives in April 2006 that the risk assessment is still inconclusive due to the uncertainties of the genotoxic and carcinogenic properties of dichlorvos also considering the overall poor quality of the dossier. The evaluation of the residue behaviour of dichlorvos in plants and livestock animals and a dietary risk assessment for consumers is not relevant for the representative use. The evaluation of the environmental fate and behaviour of dichlorvos in soil and natural surface water systems is not relevant for the representative use as these environmental compartments will only be exposed following an accident with or misuse of the plant protection product. When appropriate horticultural practice is followed, flower bulbs are washed before treatment. Therefore unlike post harvest storage treatments of other plant products, dichlorvos contamination of surface water via wash water will not occur. Based on its vapour pressure, this liquid active substance is volatile and based on its dimensionless Henry's Law air water partition coefficient (1.06x10(-5) at 20 degrees C) it will be moderately volatile from aqueous systems. Therefore from the representative indoor use, exposure of air may occur when stores are vented after treatment, however wet and dry re-deposition to land and surface waters would be expected to be negligible. Dichlorvos would not be expected to be subject to long range transport, as in the upper atmosphere photochemical reaction with hydroxyl radicals is estimated to result in a half life of 13-20 hours. The risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms and other non target organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms was considered as low because exposure is assumed to be negligible for the representative indoor use in flower bulbs. The risk posed to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trichlorfon,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.76r/full,"Trichlorfon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trichlorfon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 09 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Cequisa. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 5 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as an insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises application via tractor mounted our handheld sprayer to control lepidopteron insects in protected tomatoes with a maximum total dose of 7.2 kg trichlorfon per hectare. It should be noted that trichlorfon also has acaricidal properties. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Cekufon 80 SP a soluble powder formulation (SP), registered under different trade names in Europe. In the DAR two sources were originally proposed however one of these sources is no longer supported. It is not clear from the DAR what material was used in the supporting studies and this information has not been provided by the applicant. In addition to this a justification is required that the material used in the studies is equivalent to the material currently being produced. Adequate methods are not available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residuemethod like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. There is no method available for soil or for the relevant impurity dichlorvos in the formulation. The air method has no validation for dichlorvos which is in the residue definition. No conclusion can be made on the methods for water, soil and plants as the residue definitions are not finalised. Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Trichlorfon is harmful during oral exposure and skin sensitizer. The proposed classification is Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" and Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". The most sensitive effect observed during short term exposure is reduction in acetyl cholinesterase activity. No relevant short term NOAEL could be derived due to an inadequate database for short term toxicity (lack of subchronic studies in dog, which seems to be most sensitive, and inadequate dose-spacing in the 90-day rat study). Due to positive results for a genotoxic potential in vitro, a data requirement has been set for further in vivo data with mammalian somatic cells. Based on carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, no carcinogenic potential has been shown for trichlorfon. Based on the poor quality of the reproductive studies, a data requirement has been set for a multigeneration study in rats. However, the available teratology studies show that trichlorfon has no developmental toxicity. Due to the lack of data, the reference values were not confirmed in the expert meeting. Based on the provisional AOEL provided by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR, together with a dermal absorption of 100% instead of 10%, the operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates exceed the AOEL to a large extent. The metabolism of trichlorfon has been investigated in tomatoes. It shows that trichlorfon undergoes dehydrochlorination and rearrangements to form different metabolites. The metabolites are either conjugated or further metabolised to form naturally occurring compounds. Only the parent trichlorfon and the metabolite trichlorethanol were determined as free compounds in tomatoes. The study presents a major deficiency. That is, the origin of the important loss of radioactivity encountered in the study, ascribed by the notifier to the volatility of the metabolite dimethyl O-(2,2-dichlorovinyl phosphate), has not been proved. As both the metabolism study and the information about the toxicological relevance of metabolites are considered incomplete, it is not possible to propose a residue definition for risk assessment. The number of the submitted supervised field trials in tomatoes, carried out according to the critical GAP, was not sufficient. As a result, the residue data provided are not considered sufficient to support the use of trichlorfon in tomatoes. The nature of trichlorfon residues in processed tomato commodities has not been investigated. Furthermore, due to the limited available data on the magnitude of trichlorfon residue levels in processed commodities, the processing of raw commodities is not considered as sufficiently investigated. A confined rotational crop study with radio labelled trichlorfon was carried out, but, on the base of the available data, it was not possible to conclude whether significant residue levels are expected in rotational crops following the application of trichlorfon according to the proposed GAP. Studies on the metabolism, distribution and expression of trichlorfon residues in livestock are not required as trichlorfon is not intended for use in commodities used as animal feed. Based on the currently available data, the investigation of the residue situation is incomplete and therefore the risk assessment for consumers cannot be performed, nor can an MRL be proposed. The available data, from aerobic soil degradation studies that were not completely acceptable, suggested that trichlorfon breaks down rapidly in soil, being pH the most important factor for its degradation. The major metabolites (> 10% AR) identified in soil were desmethyl-dichlorvos and dichlorvinyl phosphate (tentatively identified). In a soil metabolism study with dichlorvos, the metabolites found were only short -lived, intermediate products of the degradation of dichlorvos, which rapidly underwent to complete mineralization. Nevertheless, due to the lack of information, a sound assessment of the route and rate of degradation of trichlorfon in soil cannot be concluded. Waiting for the new study, the available data indicated that trichlorfon and its metabolite are highly mobile in soil. Due to the difficulty to derive experimentally a reliable Koc value for trichlorfon, a worst case K-oc value of 0 to be used in the risk assessment was suggested by the experts during the peer review process. Direct photodegradation cannot be expected to contribute to the dissipation of trichlorfon in the environment. Trichlorfon appears to be stable under acid solutions, but unstable in neutral and basic solutions. Dichlorvos, desmethyl-dichlorvos and dichloroacetaldehyde were identified as degradates hydrolytically produced but they were not appropriately quantified. Potential for contamination of surface and groundwater by trichlorfon and trichlorfon degradates cannot be adequately assessed because acceptable aerobic soil degradation study and water-sediment study are not available. Preliminary PECsw presented in the DAR by the rapporteur Member State can be considered as an unrealistic worst case. A water-sediment system performed with the metabolite dichlorvos indicated that dichlorvos degraded rapidly (DT50 < 1.5 d) in the water phase and shifted partly to the sediment. Dichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetaldehyde were identified as major shortlived metabolites in the water phase. Trichlorfon would not be expected to be subject to long range transport, as in the upper atmosphere photochemical reaction with hydroxyl radicals is estimated to result in a half-life of 1.7 days. The EPCO experts' meeting on ecotoxicology defined the glasshouse in the representative uses as a permanent structure to which entry by birds and mammals is limited. Due to the limited available data package in the section on ecotoxicology the following restriction/condition for use was recommended at the experts' meeting: 'Foliar application to tomatoes under protection in Southern Europe. The risk to birds and mammals is regarded to be low based on a limited exposure situation in tomatoes under protection (see definition of a glasshouse above). The study on D. magna needs to be repeated. Based on the existing study the risk to aquatic invertebrates can provisionally already be considered as high. The need for a study on Chironomus riparius and long term studies with aquatic organisms must be considered when the water/sediment study becomes available in the section on Fate and behaviour. The risk from metabolites potentially present in surface water as a result from emissions from glasshouses calculated according to the Dutch model still needs to be addressed. The risk from trichlorfon to aquatic organisms can only be concluded once the outstanding data becomes available. Studies on the toxicity to bees are considered necessary as pollinators are present in tomato crops under glasshouse protection. The risk to bees can only be concluded once the outstanding data becomes available. The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil microorganisms and non-target plants is considered to be low. There is still an outstanding data gap for a study on the effects of trichlorfon on sewage treatment plants.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbaryl,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.80r/full,"Carbaryl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbaryl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 29 April 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 3 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience S. A. (notification and submission made by Aventis CropScience prior to merger to form Bayer CropScience). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a plant growth regulator as proposed by the applicant. The application method is by tractor mounted orchard sprayer with application to apple trees for the purpose of fruit thinning. The application rate is up to 0.9 kg of carbaryl per hectare. It should be noted that only the use as a plant growth regulator will be supported in the EU review programme. However, carbaryl is also an insecticide and acaracide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Sevin XLR plus, a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 480 g/L carbaryl, formulations are also registered under different trade names in Europe. In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Carbaryl can not be analysed by any currently available published monitoring methods due to the nature of the residues. For the other matrices only single methods are available for the same reasons as given above. For water and soil the method is HPLC with fluorescence detection and air is by HPLC-MS/MS. The method of analysis does not analyse for all components of the residue definition in surface water and therefore further data will be required to validate it for the compound 1Naphthol. Methods to determine residues of carbaryl in products of animal origin or for body fluids and tissues are not required because no MRLs will be set for products of animal origin and carbaryl is not classified as toxic or very toxic. Sufficient methods of analysis for carbaryl and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, methods of analysis are not available for the relevant impurities in the formulation and the current storage data are not acceptable as the relevant impurities were not analysed for before and after storage. Carbaryl is harmful if swallowed (oral LD50 614 mg/kg bw) and by inhalation (LC50 2.43 mg/L); it has a low acute dermal toxicity (dermal LD50 higher than 5000mg/kg bw). Carbaryl is not irritant to skin and eyes and it is not a skin sensitiser. The following classification was proposed: Harmful, R20 ` Harmful by inhalation' and R22 ` Harmful if swallowed'. The critical effect in short and long term studies was the inhibition of cholinesterase activity. The weight of evidence indicates that carbaryl is not an in vivo genotoxic agent. In mice and rats, carbaryl was found to be carcinogenic; classification with R40 ` Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect' or R45? ` May cause cancer' was discussed and agreed on to be forwarded to ECB. Carbaryl did not show any potential for reproductive and developmental toxicity. The ADI is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor of 2000 because of the carcinogenicity issue); the AOEL and ARfD are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day (safety factor 100). Operator exposure is below the AOEL when estimated with German model and considering the use of PPE like gloves during mixing/loading and hood, visor, coverall and sturdy footwear during application. The metabolism of carbaryl has been investigated in four crop groups, allowing the elucidation of the degradation pathway of the compound, which includes methyl and ring hydroxylation, carbamate ester hydrolysis and N-demethylation. Most of the metabolites formed may be further conjugated to form water-soluble glycosides. The metabolic pattern of carbaryl is evolving with time. For long PHIs the available data suggest that relevant metabolites can be present at levels representing a possible significant contribution to the toxicological burden. For the use of carbaryl for apple thinning, with a PHI of 80 days, 2 metabolites, 4-and 5-hydroxy carbaryl, which are cholinesterase inhibitors, are expected to be present in amounts of the same order of magnitude as the parent compound. Therefore these metabolites were included in the residue definition for risk assessment. Supervised residue trials were carried out with analysis of parent compound only. This allows proposing the MRL for apple to be set below the Limit of Quantification of 0.05 mg/kg, but a robust risk assessment is not possible to be conducted as information on the actual level at harvest of the 2 hydroxy metabolites is lacking. Considering that the exposure to the parent compound only is close to 50% of the ARfD for some specific population sub-groups, it cannot be excluded that the contribution of the metabolites leads to a global exceedence of the ARfD for those sub-groups. Residues in succeeding crops, in processed commodities and in animal products are not expected. In soil carbaryl exhibited low to medium persistence. The most significant sink for the 1-naphthyl(14)C-radiolabel position used in the aerobic laboratory studies was residue not extracted by methanol/water and acidified acetone water (20-39% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 15-58% AR at 100 days. In 4 of the 5 soils investigated no major (> 10% AR) metabolites were identified in soil extracts. In the fifth soil 1-naphthol was a major breakdown product accounting for a maximum of 35% AR at 2 days. 1-Naphthol however exhibited very low persistence in this soil. Under anaerobic soil conditions 1-naphthol was also a major soil breakdown product. Carbaryl exhibited medium soil mobility based on the results of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. 1-Naphthol was characterised as also exhibiting medium soil mobility on the basis of the estimation provided by a guideline HPLC method. In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments, carbaryl exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 1.2-5 days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment (accounting for up to 24% AR at 0-60 days) and biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolite 1naphthol accounted for a maximum of 35% AR 2 days after application, levels subsequently declined. 1-naphthol was also present in sediment but at low levels (maximum 9.5% AR). Residues not extracted from sediment by acidified methanol: water and acidified acetone: water represented 3664% AR at study end (30-101 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the 1-naphthol-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for 10.6-18 % AR by 101 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with parent carbaryl via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member states should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for carbaryl from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should carbaryl be included in annex 1. Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated that for the applied for intended use on apples leaching to groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit (0.1 mu g/L) would not be expected for either carbaryl or 1-naphthol. A high long-term risk to insectivorous birds and a high acute and long-term risk to herbivorous mammals were identified in a first tier risk assessment. The submitted information was not sufficient to address the potential high risk to insectivorous birds in orchards and a data gap was identified in the EPCO expert meeting. A refined risk assessment based on residue decline was not accepted to refine the acute risk to herbivorous mammals. For the long-term risk assessment more information was requested on how the DT50 value for the residue decline was calculated. This information was included in addendum 2 of February 2006. The EFSA considers the information as sufficient and considers the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals as low. However, the potential high acute risk to herbivorous mammals still needs to be addressed. Carbaryl is very toxic to aquatic arthropods. The submitted microcosm study was assessed by the RMS as not being of use in deriving an EAC value since the exposure regime was representative only for aquatic habitats with very basic pH conditions where carbaryl degrades very rapidly. The proposed probabilistic approach was discussed by the EPCO experts ' meeting. Uncertainty remained on which endpoints were used to construct the SSD. The splitting of data as suggested by the applicant would only be accepted if data fall into discrete groups based on sensitivity. The meeting considered the proposed trigger of 1 based on acute LC50 values as not acceptable. The meeting proposed to take the awaited opinion of the PPR panel on the possibility of lowering the uncertainty factor into account. Based on the PPR opinion on the possibility of lowering the uncertainty factor (see main text) the EFSA calculated the TER values for insects and crustaceans. The TERs are still below the trigger of 100 even if a no-spray buffer zone of 50 m is taken into account for the PECsw calculation. Overall it is concluded that the representative use of carbaryl poses a high acute and longterm risk to crustaceans and aquatic insects. The HQ values for bees indicated a high risk from oral and dermal exposure. A field study was submitted to address the potential high risk. Although the EPCO experts had some reservations regarding the submitted field study, the meeting was content that the particular use does not pose a high risk to bees because the product is applied only once per year after flowering. The in-field and off-field HQ values indicated a high risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi. Extented laboratory studies showed that residue decline within 14 days is sufficient to allow recolonisation of treated fields. However a high off-field risk remains. The HQ trigger of 2 is not met even at a distance of 250 m from the treated field. No field data were submitted to show recovery/recolonisation of nontarget insects in the treated area. Therefore it is concluded that recolonisation of the treated in-field area from unaffected off-field populations is not sufficiently demonstrated and needs to be further addressed. Since the DT90 of carbaryl was in the range of 100 to 365 days and the standard HQ for non-target arthropods was exceeded a study with other soil non-target macro organisms is triggered. A data gap was identified by the EFSA to submit a study with collembola to assess the effects on other soilmacro organisms. The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance phosmet,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.75r/full,"Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing. In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities. The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification. The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact. The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.003 mg/kg/day, based on a LOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day and an additional safety factor of 3. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw/day and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses. Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions. Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group. The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions. Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil. Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use. The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively. In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (> 10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (53-77% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified. Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible. In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (> 10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, O-dimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated. A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified. Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe. Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas. The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,"Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 1,3-dichloropropene",2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.72r/full,"1,3-Dichloropropene is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of 1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprise either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system (""EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth (""XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grew. The application rates are up to 283 kg 1,3-dichloropropene per hectare (""EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare (""XRM-5048""), respectively. 1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of 1,3-dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as nematicide will be supported in the EU review programme. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Telone EC Drip"" (""EF-1478""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Greece, Italy and Spain and ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") registered under different trade names in some Member States of the EU. The formulation ""Telone Injected"" (""XRM-5048"") is coded as "" any other liquid"" (AL). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The toxicological risk assessment (and reference values) is considered to be inconclusive due to uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. 1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 ""Toxic by dermal exposure and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 ""Irritant to skin"" and R43 ""May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should be classified as irritant to eyes too and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"". The weight of evidence indicates that 1,3-dichloropropene is an in vivo genotoxic agent for somatic cells, acting directly or after activation by cytochrome P450, and glutathione protects against the genotoxicity. The classification of Mutagenic Category 3, R68 is proposed. 1,3-dichloropropene induced benign tumours in the liver of rats and in both urinary bladder epithelium and lung of mice. In addition, one hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in rats. However, the mechanism of action for tumour formation has not been yet identified. Although, results indicate that 1,3-dichloropopene can be mutagenic, the relevance of these results to mammalian tumour formation is uncertain owing to the high concentrations or doses used. The issue was to be forwarded to the PPR panel. The classification as possible human carcinogenic Category 3, R40? is highlighted. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites 3chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid are both toxic. Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated imp, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies. According to medical data, 1,3-dichloropropene should be classified as irritating to eyes (R36) and to irritating to respiratory system (R37). Furthermore, it is proposed to classify as R65 "" Harmful, may cause lung damage if swallowed"" due observed the adverse effects, The provisional Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) ADI is 0.0125 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 200. The additional safety factor of 2 was added in order to have at least 1000 between the ADI and the dose level where tumours are evident. The provisional systemic Acceptable Operator Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposition and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m(3)), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.066 ppm, equivalent to 0.30 mg/m(3) however should be considered as provisional. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added. The 1,3-dichloropropene is applied to bare soil and consisted of two scenarios. The estimations are based on field measurements. However, the estimated operator exposure should be considered only as indicative due to the uncertainties in relation to the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. For both uses drip irrigation and soil injection, PPE (gloves and coverall) and RPE (respiratory mask with filter for organic vapours) is needed in order not to exceed the AOEL (16% and 38%, respectively). The exposure for workers and bystanders should be negligible. The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beets), and pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radio labelled material to the soil surrounding the tree or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat). Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data. However, it is stressed that the available studies don't provide any information regarding the residue behaviour of the chlorinated impurities present in the technical material that are added to soil at a high level (up to ca 6 kg/ha) when applying 1,3-D at the intended rate. There is no information on possible persistency, uptake, accumulation or metabolic fate and residue level of those chlorinated impurities, whether of known or unknown type, and moreover data on their toxicological properties are not available. This lack of data gives rise to concern in respect of consumer safety, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3 D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below (< 1%) the ADI and ARfD, respectively. 1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR. In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies 1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroaryl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility. In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of 1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. 1,3dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available for the drip irrigation application in glasshouses. There is a data gap for acceptable concentration estimates from the outdoor uses, where the exposure from the drainage and runoff routes of entry need to be appropriately assessed. Member State experts' considered that potential deposition from the air to surface water should also be considered by the notifier when providing aquatic PEC from the outdoor uses notified. FOCUS groundwater tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. However data requirements for further information regarding aspects of this monitoring have been identified. These identified deficiencies should be addressed before this monitoring work is used for regulatory decision making. 1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA. There is a data gap identified to provide information that these measured flux losses under American geoclimatic conditions are also pertinent to EU geoclimatic conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the 1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment. Bridging studies are needed if new impurities are identified in the new five batch analysis which are not covered by the batches tested in the section on ecotoxicology. As the relevance of the impurity 1,2-dichloropropane was not discussed during the peer review process, the EFSA proposes the applicant to addresses the ecotoxicological relevance of this impurity. The levels of 1,2dichloropropane in the ecotoxicological studies must be confirmed if considered relevant. The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long term risk to earthworm eating and insectivorous mammals is identified for the outdoor uses. Data to address these risks is still awaited. No long term toxicity study with birds is available. A residue study on plants is awaited to assess the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals. The risk to birds and mammals for the outdoor uses can only be concluded once the outstanding data requirements become available. The EPCO expert's meeting set a data requirement for the applicant to submit the endpoints for algae based on biomass. Once these become available the risk assessment needs to be revised based on the lowest endpoint. Algae and Lemna gibba are more sensitive to the metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid than to the parent compound. Long term studies with the metabolite (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid on fish and Daphnia magna are requested as this metabolite has been identified and requires further consideration based on potential levels in ground and surface water. The acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation can be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk to aquatic organisms from the direct soil injection method of application indoors and outdoors, can only be concluded once the PEC in surface water become available (see 4.2.1 and 5.2). Given the high application rate (up to 224 kg a. s./ha) and aquatic endpoints below 1 mg a. s./L risk mitigation measures might become necessary. The risk for bioconcentration in fish for 1,3-dichloropropene and metabolites (EZ)-3chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid is considered to be low. An inhalation study with bees and a calculation of relevant PEC values to conduct the risk assessment for the inhalation toxicity to bees is requested as the active substance can be found in the air even at distances of 800 m from the treated field. Observed effects 1 day after treatment (DAT) were below 30% for H. aculeifer, P. cupreus, A. bilineata and Pardosa spp. 1 DAT 78% effect on mortality was observed for F. candida. No adverse effects of Telone II treated soil were observed when F. candida was introduced 22 days after treatment of the soil. Given the observed effects on Folsomia candida the rapporteur Member State asked the applicant to further address the risk to non-target arthropods for the outdoor uses. A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The announced new field study in UK potato fields is still awaited to address several comments which were raised on the existing earthworm field study. The long term risk to earthworm from exposure to 7 day old treated soil can be regarded as low. The acute and long term risk to earthworms exposed to freshly treated soil can only be concluded once the outstanding field data become available. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses. Effects from 40.23% to 96.9% on soil microbial respiration and nitrogen transformation were observed on day 90 at the end of the study while the test soils were incubated with fresh untreated soil on day 49. A field study to address this concern was discussed at the EPCO experts' meeting and the meeting identified the need for a new field study to address this risk which should also cover the concern for the effects from the soil metabolites. The rapporteur Member State considers that this data gap only applies to the outdoor uses. Regarding the indoor uses, the EFSA would like to point out that earthworms, soil micro-organisms, F. candida and other soil non-target arthropods are likely to come into contact with 1,3dichloropropene as the product is applied to full soil. This could affect the function of the soil indoors. A potential risk to non-target plants was identified. The EPCO Expert's meeting decided that the risk should be more quantified and TER values at a few metres from the field should be calculated. The risk to non-target plants can only be concluded once this risk assessment becomes available. It cannot be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance formetanate,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.75r,"Formetanate is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on formetanate in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 13 July 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 23 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide and insecticide comprise broadcast spraying to control the thrips and mites in tomatoes and ornamental shrubs at an application rate of 500 g formetanate per hectare. Formetanate can be as acaricide and insecticide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was "" Dicarzol 500 SG"" (""AEB036056 00 SG58 A200""), a water soluble granule (SG), registered in France, Portugal and Spain. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i. e. formetanate and its salts in food of plant origin, soil and water. In the case of air it should be noted that the analytical method is not specific as required in, because it is not possible to differentiate between residue of formetanate and its salts. Also an analytical method for blood (plasma) is available to cover Annex point 4.2.5 of Directive 96/46/EC. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Formetanate hydrochloride is rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration. It is mainly excreted in urine. No tendency for bioaccumulation was observed. It is highly toxic after oral administration and by inhalation, not toxic after dermal exposure, not irritant, but a skin sensitizer. The proposed classification is: T+, R26/28 "" Highly toxic by inhalation and if swallowed""; Xi, R43 "" May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Short term toxicity is manifested by cholinesterase inhibition in all species, the dog being the most sensitive. Formetanate hydrochloride has a mutagenic potential in vitro, but not in vivo, and there is no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. No reproductive or teratogenic effects have been observed in rats and rabbits. All the tested metabolites are less toxic than formetanate hydrochloride. The kinetics of cholinesterase inhibition was studied in female rats and in dogs. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.004 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.005 mg/kg bw. All the reference values were derived with a safety factor of 100. According to the German model, the estimated operator exposure during field use is 55% of the AOEL with PPE for the tractor mounted scenario, and 99% of the AOEL with PPE and RPE for the hand held scenario. According to calculations with the German and UK models, application with automated gantry sprayers in glasshouse gives an operator exposure of 31 and 8.3% of the systemic AOEL with PPE. The worker exposure (during tomatoes harvest) and the bystander exposure estimates are below the AOEL. The metabolism of formetanate in plants has been fully elucidated and proceeds through hydrolysis steps. The parent compound has been identified as the major constituent of the residue on various crops and for various PHIs. The identified metabolites are less toxic than the parent compound. Therefore the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound only, for both risk assessment and monitoring. Under processing, formetanate is degraded at temperature of 100 degrees C or higher to a less toxic compound, 3-hydroxyformanilide. The processed commodities obtained after boiling or sterilisation have a significantly lower concentration of formetanate than raw tomatoes. There is no exposure of livestock to formetanate residues. The soil uptake by rotational crops is minimal and there is no need for setting plant back restriction. The chronic exposure of the consumer is well below the ADI of formetanate. Acute intake calculations have indicated a potential acute risk for infants and toddlers resulting from the consumption of treated tomatoes grown under glass house conditions. The level of the proposed MRL in tomatoes, which is significantly higher than the level considered in exposure assessments, causes still higher concern in terms of consumer safety. In acidic soils the main sink for the dissipation of formetanate was the formation of unextracted residues with mineralisation to CO2 accounting for 2.7-13.7% of the applied radioactivity (AR) at 41 to 91 days. However in an alkaline soil (pH 7.2), after 59 days mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 80% AR with unextracted residue accounting for only 9.2% AR. No major (> 10% AR) breakdown products were identified in methanol or water extracts. The use of a more harsh methanol Soxhlet extraction released more radioactivity from soil samples, but was also shown to hydrolyse formetanate to the major breakdown products 3-FAPMC(3)53-58% AR after 28 days. No major metabolites were present in sediment extracts. In water the major metabolites were 3-HF (max. 39% AR), 3-FAPMC (max. 34% AR), 3-AP (max. 23% AR), 3-APMC (max. 13% AR) and 3-HPDMF (max. 12% AR). These maximum concentrations all occurred between 0.5 and 7 days. These metabolites exhibited very low to low persistence in the water. The first tier risk assessment for birds indicates acute and long term risk to birds. Short-term TERs were above the trigger but were based on a LC50 value that was questioned by the experts' meeting due to strong food avoidance observed in the study. A refined acute and long-term assessment is available based on measured residues in food items and selected focal species. Due to the late submission date this assessment has not been peer reviewed or discussed by Member States. It should be noted that the refined acute assessment is based on the questioned LC50 value from a short-term dietary study. Also for mammals the first tier assessment indicated an acute risk, while the long-term risk was considered low. A refined assessment of the acute risk for different focal species taking recommendations given in the PPR Panel opinions for pirimicarb and metamidophos into account is available but has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, no final conclusion on the risk to birds and mammals can be reached at this stage. Formetanate is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates, particularly cladocerans. Based on the results from an available microcosm study the risk is however considered to be low for the evaluated representative uses. Toxicity towards bees and other non-target arthropods is high. Formetanate should not be applied later than two weeks before flowering to protect bees. Even though a potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, the risk to sensitive nontarget arthropods off-field is high even at a distance of 50 m from the field border. Further data is required to fully address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation. Furthermore a higher tier study with T. pyri is required. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-and microorganisms, flora and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered as low., 3-APMC4 and 3-HF5. As it is not possible to know if the radioactive residue in soil released by methanol Soxhlet extraction was present as parent formetanate or breakdown products, the available environmental exposure assessments have been carried out assuming all the Soxhlet extractable radioactivity was parent formetanate and also, as a worst case assuming 100% conversion of applied formetanate to the breakdown products identified in extracts, which were 3-FAPMC (max 20.2% AR), 3-APMC (max 50.6% AR), 3-HF (max 17.6% AR), 3-HPDMF6 (max 23% AR in a photolysis study, utilising oven dried soil), and 3-AP7 (max 5.7% AR). Formetanate exhibits low to moderate persistence in soil. 3-FAPMC exhibits very low persistence, 3-AMPC and 3-HF very low to low persistence with 3-HPDMF exhibiting low persistence in soil. Formetanate exhibits high to low soil mobility and as it is a basic substance with a pKa of 8.1 would be expected to be more mobile under high soil pH conditions. However the higher mobility under alkali conditions is unlikely to lead to an increased risk of formetanate leaching due to the more rapid hydrolytic degradation of formetanate under alkali soil conditions. There was no evidence that the adsorption of any of the soil metabolites was pH dependant. 3-AMPC exhibits very high to high mobility, 3-FAPMC exhibits high mobility, 3-HF exhibits medium mobility and 3-HPDMF exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Based on the evidence from FOCUS groundwater scenario modelling for the notified intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure by formetanate or its potential soil metabolites 3-FAPMC, 3-HPDMF, 3-HF and 3-APMC above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, is considered low. In natural sediment water systems (laboratory) 20 degrees C formetanate dissipated rapidly from water from a combination of adsorption to sediment and rapid degradation, with formetanate exhibiting very low persistence in both water and sediment. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 14-30% AR after 28-70 days, with unextracted sediment residues being the major sink in the material balance accounting for 53-58% AR after 28 days. No major metabolites were present in sediment extracts. In water the major metabolites were 3-HF (max. 39% AR), 3-FAPMC (max. 34% AR), 3-AP (max. 23% AR), 3-APMC (max. 13% AR) and 3-HPDMF (max. 12% AR). These maximum concentrations all occurred between 0.5 and 7 days. These metabolites exhibited very low to low persistence in the water. The first tier risk assessment for birds indicates acute and long term risk to birds. Short-term TERs were above the trigger but were based on a LC50 value that was questioned by the experts' meeting due to strong food avoidance observed in the study. A refined acute and long-term assessment is available based on measured residues in food items and selected focal species. Due to the late submission date this assessment has not been peer reviewed or discussed by Member States. It should be noted that the refined acute assessment is based on the questioned LC50 value from a short-term dietary study.

[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance propamocarb,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.78r/full,"Propamocarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on propamocarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 5 October 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 October 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the two applicants Bayer CropScience and Chimac Agriphar. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. The two notifiers informed the meeting that they had now formed a task force for the purpose of the active substance review. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. The application rates are: A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide, which comprise foliar spraying, drenching or drip irrigation to control a broad spectrum of plant diseases in lettuce, potatoes, tomato (grown in soil and rock wool). in lettuce 2 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 144.4 kg propamocarb hydrochloride per hectare (drenching) and 2 applications resulting in a maximum total dose 3.32 kg per hectare (spraying) in potatoes up to 6 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 6.498 kg per hectare (spraying) in tomatoes (soil grown) 2 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 144.4 kg per hectare (drenching) and 2 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 4.332 kg per hectare (drip irrigation) in tomatoes (rock wool grown) 1 application 28.9 kg per hectare (drenching) and 4 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 8.664 kg per hectare (drip irrigation). Only the use of propamocarb as a fungicide was evaluated. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Previcur N"" and ""Proplant"", both are soluble concentrate (SL), registered in most of the Member State of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. It should be noted that the analytical methods are not able to differentiate between residue of propamocarb and its salts. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Propamocarb hydrochloride is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity; it is not a skin or an eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser, as confirmed during the meeting on the basis of the positive results in the Magnusson & Kligman test and the recently submitted LLNA (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed). There is no evidence of genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential associated with propamocarb hydrochloride. In the reproductive toxicity studies, the parental NOAEL was 15 mg a.s./kg bw/day, while the and reproductive NOAELs were 37.5. mg a.s/kg bw/day based on decreased sperm concentration and count in the epididymis; the parental and developmental NOAELs were 31 mg a. s./kg bw/day based on decreased individual foetal body weight and increased number of small foetuses at 123 mg a. s/kg bw/day in the rat. The NOAEL for acute neurotoxicity was set at 1321 mg/kg bw/day propamocarb hydrochloride; the NOAEL for subchronic neurotoxicity in rat was 72 mg/kg bw/day propamocarb hydrochloride, based on the occurrence of intra-epithelial vacuolation of the choroids plexus in cerebrum and cerebellum at higher doses. The ADI and AOEL are 0.29 mg propamocarb hydrochloride/kg bw/day, while the ARfD is 1 mg propamocarb hydrochloride/ kg bw/day. The operator, worker and bystander risk assessment is inconclusive. The metabolism of propamocarb hydrochloride in plants has been fully elucidated. Applied by foliar treatment of plants, the compound is degraded through hydroxylation, oxidation, N-demethylation and cyclisation, but however remains the major compound of the residue pattern. Applied by soil treatment or hydroponically with nutritive solution, its levels, as well as those of its structurally related metabolites, resulting from uptake and translocation into edible parts of the plants are low. In this case the major part of the radioactivity present in plants is due to the incorporation in the plant of the CO2 produced by complete degradation of the compound. Similar residue pattern is found in potato tubers after foliar treatment of the aerial parts of the plant. The residue definition proposed consists therefore in the sum of propamocarb and its salts. Supervised residue trials adequately supporting all the representative uses have been submitted. In lettuce it has been identified that the use of propamocarb hydrochloride in winter under glasshouse condition leads to the highest residue levels. In tomatoes, hydroponical application on rockwool may lead to low measurable residue levels, while this type of application on soil-grown tomatoes leads consistently to residue levels below the LOQ of the employed method of analysis (0.01 mg/kg). In potatoes, residues were always below the LOQ of the method of analysis (0.1 mg/kg). On the basis of these residue trials, MRLs can be proposed at 30 mg/kg for lettuce and at 0.1 mg/kg for both tomatoes and potatoes. In succeeding and rotational crops, residues of propamocarb may be present for short plant back intervals. Based on the available information, a delay of 120 days should be observed between the last application of propamocarb hydrochloride and the sowing or planting of the following crop to avoid any significant transfer of soil residues. Residues in animal commodities or in processed commodities resulting from the representative uses are not expected. The conducted acute and chronic exposure assessments do not suggest any risk for the health of the consumer. Laboratory soil metabolism and field dissipation data showed that propamocarb hydrochloride degrades readily in viable agricultural soils. The aerobic and anaerobic soil metabolism and soil photolysis studies indicated that no metabolites or degradation products were observed to form at levels greater than 10%, with the exception of CO2 (accounting for 56-66.2% AR after 120 days). Propamocarb hydrochloride was either converted to non-extractable residues in the humic acid, fulvic acid, or humin fractions,or into transient non-accumulating metabolites. Under anaerobic conditions only limited CO2 levels were observed, indicating no significant mineralisation. The rates of degradation of propamocarb hydrochloride observed in laboratory studies triggered the need for a field dissipation study (DT50lab, 20 degrees C = 10.9 - 136 days). Results of field dissipation studies performed in USA suggested that propamocarb hydrochloride dissipates rapidly under field conditions with a DT50 ranging from 17.4 and 23.7 days. Batch equilibrium sorption data suggested that the active ingredient has a limited potential for mobility in soil and should not adversely impact groundwater under normal use conditions. This conclusion was supported by FOCUS groundwater modelling, showing 80th percentile PECGW values at 1 m depth for propamocarb hydrochloride less than 0.1 mu g/L for all modelled scenarios. However, recalculations for the use on tomatoes taking into account the drip irrigation method in the field application should be performed. Propamocarb hydrochloride is stable to hydrolysis and photodegradation is not a relevant degradation pathway for propamocarb hydrochloride in the aquatic environment. In natural surface water systems [14C]-propamocarb hydrochloride partitioned readily from the water phase and shifted partly to the sediment. There were no major metabolites in water or sediment. The environmental exposure assessments available were sufficient to complete appropriate EU level estimates of PECsw/sed for the intended use on potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes. However, new modelling is required for the use on tomatoes taking into account the drip irrigation method for the application in the field. Volatilization is not considered a probable route of dissipation of propamocarb hydrochloride, and the half-life in air indicated that long range transport is not likely. The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential acute, short-term and long term risk to herbivorous birds and a long-term risk to insectivorous birds. It was agreed by the Experts' meeting on ecotoxicology that the risk from the uses in tomatoes and potatoes is low because tomato and potato leaves are not attractive as a food source. For the use in lettuce it is questionable if the risk is sufficiently addressed on the basis of the submitted residue data in lettuce. Further information to support the PT assumption is required. The risk to mammals and to insectivorous birds is considered to be low for all representative uses. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for all representative uses assuming that the potato use is the critical gap in terms of exposure of aquatic organisms. It is not certain if this is true for the use in tomatoes in southern Europe and an aquatic risk assessment has to be conducted for this use. A high in-field risk was indicated for non-target arthropods. The experts 'meeting agreed that the submitted higher tier studies (extended laboratory studies) provided sufficient information to conclude on a low off-field and in-field risk to non-target arthropods for all representative uses. No effects were observed in tests with Previcur N at a concentration of more than 2 times the initial PEC soil for the critical GAP (potatoes). Effects of >+/- 25% on soil nitrification were observed in a test with Proplant. However, the tested dose was 100 times the proposed field rate and the observed effect decreased with time. Therefore the risk to soil non-target micro organisms risk is considered to be low for all representative uses. The risk to aquatic organisms, bees, earthworms, other non target organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all representative uses.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dimethomorph,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.82r/full,"Dimethomorph is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dimethomorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 23 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises application via tractor mounted hydraulic sprayer to hops, grapes and potatoes. The total maximum dose to hops is 3 kg dimethomorph per hectare, 1.5 kg dimethomorph per hectare for grapes and for potatoes 1.44 kg/ha (number of applications: 8) in Northern Europe and 0.9 kg/ha (number of applications: 5) in Southern Europe. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Forum"", a dispersible concentrate formulation (DC). Adequate methods are available to monitor for dimethomorph. Residues in food of plant origin products of animal origin and soil can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of dimethomorph. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The toxicological studies are performed with batches where the ratio E/Z isomer is between 43/57 to 45/55. Dimethomorph is rapidly and completely absorbed, more than 90% is eliminated via the bile within 24 hours. Dimethomorph is widely distributed and it is extensively metabolized. It is of low acute toxicity i.e. oral LD50 3900 mg/kg bw, dermal LD50 > 2000 mg/kg bw and inhalation LC50 > 4.24 mg/L. It is neither a skin or an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer. The target organs are the liver, testes and prostate (dog only). The dog was the most sensitive species with a short term NOAEL of 4.9 mg/kg bw/day (one year). There is no mutagenic or genotoxic or carcinogenic potential of dimethomorph. The long term NOAEL is 9 mg/kg bw/day in the rat based on decreased body weight gain and cellular alterations in the liver (females). There was no effect on the reproductive performance. The NOAEL for offspring, as well as reproduction, was 67 mg/kg bw/day. There are developmental effects observed in the rat and rabbit in conjunction to only mild maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity is 60 mg/kg bw/day. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.15 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 applied. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is based on the NOAEL 60 mg/kg bw/day from the rat developmental study rat where embryolethality as well as death of dams was observed at 160 mg/kg bw/day, with safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption value for the representative formulation Forum 15 DC is 20%. The estimated exposure according to the German model is below the AOEL without any personal protective equipment (PPE) for potatoes (31%) but PPE is needed for hops and grapes in order to be below the AOEL. If PPE is not considered, the exposure is 128% and 282% of the AOEL for hops and wines, respectively. Estimated exposure for workers and bystanders are also below the AOEL. The metabolism of dimethomorph in plants when applied as foliar spray is fully elucidated. It proceeds through hydrolysis of the 2 methoxy groups of the dimethoxyphenyl ring, hydrolysis and oxidation of the morpholine ring. None of the metabolites identified is expected to contribute significantly to the toxicological burden the consumer may be exposed to and therefore the residue definition in plant products for monitoring and risk assessment is proposed to be limited to the parent compound. Sufficient information from field studies is present in order to set MRLs and adequately assess the chronic and acute exposures of the consumer. Processing does not affect the nature of the residue and processing factor can be established for wine and beer. No residue of dimethomorph or its metabolites is expected to be present at measurable level in animal commodities as the potential livestock exposure resulting from the consumption of potatoes is very limited. The residue definition for animal commodities is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound. However this definition should be reconsidered for milk and poultry products for which dimethomorph cannot be considered as an appropriate indicator compound, if on the basis of additional uses, beyond the scope of this peer review, animal exposure would be higher. In following crops the presence of low amounts of dimethomorph is possible in some rare occasions. This however does not represent a concern in terms of consumer safety. Proposed MRLs are 2 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg for wine and table grapes, dried hops and potatoes respectively. The supported representative use of dimethomorph on those crops does not represent a risk for the safety of the consumer, at short or long term. The available data demonstrated that in soil dimethomorph is moderately persistent, with aerobic soil metabolism DT50lab ranging from 41 to 96 days in four soils. Microbial metabolism was the primary route of dissipation. No aerobic soil metabolism degradates were identified other than small amounts of 14(CO2) (maximum 31% AR after 120 days). As dimethomorph degraded, most of the radioactivity was not extracted from the soil (accounting for 18-52% AR after 120 days). During the aerobic degradation studies a shift in the E/Z isomers ratio was observed in the extractable dimethomorph; this was explained by a slower degradation of the Z-isomer rather than by isomerisation from E to Z under environmental conditions. A pair of isomers of mono-desmethyl dimethomorph were isolated and identified as primary (< 10% AR) intermediates for the anaerobic studies. Degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions with DT50 values of about 26 days. Dimethomorph exhibited a low to medium mobility in soil and there was no evidence that adsorption changed with variation in soil pH. Dimethomorph did not hydrolyze or photo degraded in the submitted studies. In natural sediment water systems (dark laboratory studies) dimethomorph rapidly partitioned from the water phase into sediment and was fixed as unextractable residues (47-75% AR after 100 days). In sediment, dimethomorph was slowly metabolised to a certain amount to minor polar components. However, degradation appeared to be incomplete, with a mineralisation rate of 1.0-22% AR in around 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment via spray drift considered PECinitial values after the first application, PECactual values after the last application and PECtwa values over various time-frames between 1 and 100 days after the last application for the minimum distances of 3 and 1 m for hops or grapevines and potatoes. Long-term risk assessment was based on PECtwa values over a period of 46 days with specific moving time-window for each crop to ensure that worst-case values were obtained. Run-off route of exposure to surface water should be considered at Member State level and where pertinent additional aquatic risk assessment completed. FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated a low potential for groundwater contamination in vulnerable situations over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions across the EU for the uses assessed in this conclusion (at all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios annual average leachate concentrations of dimethomorph leaving the to 1 m soil layer predicted to be below the parametric legal drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L). Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected. A high first tier acute risk was identified for insectivorous birds in hops, medium herbivorous birds in potatoes, and small herbivorous mammals in hops and vine. The long-term risk to insectivorous birds in hops and to small herbivorous mammals in hops and vine cannot be concluded based on the available information and needs to be further addressed. Since potato leaves are considered unpalatable to birds, and weeds are not that frequent in potato field, it is the EFSA opinion that the acute risk to herbivorous birds in potato is probably low. However, further information is needed to conclude on the risk to insectivorous birds in hops and small herbivorous mammals in hops and vine where relevant decisions are to be based on the assessment according to SANCO/4145/2000. The acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms from the use in potato the is low, while for hops and grapevine risk mitigation measures comparable to buffer zones of 20 and 5 m respectively, are needed. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil macro-organisms, soil microorganisms, non-target plants and methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance methiocarb,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.79r/full,"Methiocarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on methiocarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 March 2004. ollowing a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 15 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 April 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as molluscicide, repellent and insecticide as proposed by the applicant. The use as molluscicide comprises spreading the bait to control slugs and snails in oilseed rape at an application rate of 120 g methiocarb per hectare with maximal 2 applications resulting in a maximum total dose of 240 g/hectare. The use as seed treatment in maize at an application rate of 500 g/dt (= 150 g/ha at a seeding rate of 30 kg/ha) is intended to control frit flys and repel pheasants. Methiocarb can be used as molluscicide, insecticide, repellent and acaricide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Mesurol RB 4"", a bait ready for use (RB) and ""Mesurol FS 500"", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), both are registered in most of the EU Member States. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-ethod like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methiocarb is acutely very toxic by oral route and toxic after inhalation in rats. It is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser. The following classification was therefore proposed: T+ Very toxic, R28 Very toxic if swallowed, R23 Toxic on inhalation. Methiocarb was clastogenic in the chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells but this was not confirmed in cytological analysis in a micronucleus test. There was no evidence of genotoxicity in other in vitro and in vivo studies. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Methiocarb did not affect reproductive and developmental parameters and did not show any potential to cause delayed neurotoxicity. The ADI, ARfD and AOEL of 0.013 mg/kg bw/day were proposed. The operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL for the use of FS formulation (maize seed treatment), while the AOEL is likely to be exceeded when the RB formulation (oilseed rape) is considered. The metabolism of methiocarb was investigated in tomato, lettuce, rice and oilseed rape following a soil application or a seed treatment. In tomato, lettuce, rice methiocarb and methiocarb sulphoxid (M01) were identified as major components. Methiocarb phenol (M03) and methiocarb sulfoxide phenol (M04) could be released at significant levels upon hydrolysis of lettuce extracts. In oilseed rape the metabolic pattern at harvest was different. A major part of the radioactivity was associated with fatty acids in the seeds. Methiocarb sulphoxide phenol (M04) and methiocarb sulphone phenol (M05) and their glucose conjugates were identified as main constituents in rape matrices. These compounds were also present at significant levels in crops planted as succeeding crops. The experts' meeting for residues concluded that there is currently insufficient information available to have a firm view on the plant residue definition and proposed that either all phenol metabolites should be included in the plant residue definition and hence more information on suitable methods and appropriate residue trials is needed or alternatively that the toxicity of the phenol metabolites should be further addressed. Consequently a final consumer risk assessment is currently not possible and MRLs cannot be proposed. Studies were provided on aerobic and anaerobic degradation, photolysis, and adsorption of methiocarb. Data showed that methiocarb is not persistent in soil. Under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, methiocarb is degraded in soil in less than 2 days and the major degradation products are methiocarb sulfoxide, (M01), methiocarb sulfoxide phenol (M04), methiocarb sulfone phenol (M05) and methiocarb methoxy sulfone (M10). Metabolites M01 and M04 can be classified as low persistent and metabolites M05 and M10 as moderate persistent. Under anaerobic conditions, a new metabolite, methiocarb phenol (M03) was observed. As the use as a pellet formulation in winter oilseed rape post-drilling up to GS 16 could result in anaerobic degradation for the active substance, PECsoil for the anaerobic metabolite M03 was calculated. Photodegradation in soil will contribute to the degradation of methiocarb to M01 and M04 under environmental conditions. Methiocarb is low to medium mobile in soil, whereas the major soil metabolites (M01, M04, M05 and M10) can be classified as medium to very high mobile in soil. Methiocarb is considered unstable to hydrolysis. Hydrolytic breakdown may be expected to contribute to the degradation of methiocarb in the environment under alkali or pH neutral conditions. Degradation of methiocarb in natural surface water systems may be influenced by sunlight. Results from a non-radiolabelled water/sediment study, with methiocarb applied as pellet formulation, indicated that the active substance degraded quite fast (DT50 < 10 days) to methiocarb phenol (M03) and methiocarb sulfoxide phenol (M04) in the water phase. Potential risk for surface water contamination was performed considering drainflow as the main route of entry into the water body, and was considered acceptable. However, a comprehensive surface water risk assessment including runoff will be necessary at Member State level to complete the risk assessment of the pellets formulation and the molluscicidal use. For the representative uses, parent methiocarb and its soil metabolites M01, M04, M05 and M10 would not be expected to leach to groundwater above 0.1 mu g/L. Concentration of methiocarb in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. The first tier risk assessment for birds and mammals for the use of ""Mesurol FS 500"" as a seed treatment resulted in a high risk to birds and mammals from uptake of treated maize seeds. Avoidance studies and field studies were conducted to refine the risk to seed-eating birds. The study results suggest that freshly drilled maize fields are not attractive to small seed-eating birds. Due to their inability to ingest whole seeds, small birds may only ingest pieces of methiocarb treated maize seeds. Encounters between small birds and small pieces of treated maize seed on an arable field in spring were considered to be very low. The acceptance studies did not investigate small seed-eating birds but the studies provide some evidence of a general repellency of treated seeds. Therefore the rapporteur Member State considered the risk to small seed eating birds as low. In the avoidance and field studies it was shown that maize treated with ""Mesurol FS 500"" had a strong repellent effect to larger seedeating birds potentially feeding on maize. No treatment related mortalities were observed in the tests even under severe feeding pressure. Therefore it was concluded that the risk to birds from the representative use of ""Mesurol FS 500"" is low. Avoidance studies revealed the repellent effect of ""Mesurol FS 500"" to mammals. The availability of treated maize seeds on the soil surface is low. Furthermore, field studies showed relatively low abundance of small rodents in maize fields. Therefore it was concluded by the rapporteur Member State that the representative use of ""Mesurol FS 500"" poses a low risk to small mammals. The risk to birds from the representative use of ""Mesurol RB4"" as a slug pellet was assessed as high and further data are needed to quantify the risk to key species of farmland birds and predatory birds. Short-term effects were observed for populations of small mammals in fields treated with ""Mesurol RB4"". However populations recovered fast and it was concluded that the risk to wild mammals is low from the representative use in rape. Data/information is needed to address the risk to small earthworm eating mammals such as the common shrew (Sorex araneus). The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low based on entry into surface water via drainflow. The exposure of aquatic organisms from run-off was not assessed but should be considered at Member State level. The risk to other non-target arthropods from the use of ""Mesurol FS 500"" was assessed as low. The in-field risk to certain species of carabid beetles was assessed as high for the representative use of ""Mesurol RB4"". The expert meeting concluded that off-field exposure and inand off-field risk mitigation measures should be considered at Member State level. The risk to earthworms is low for the representative use of ""Mesurol FS 500"". The application of ""Mesurol RB4"" led to a significant reduction in earthworm abundance in a field study on grassland but recovery was observed within one year after application. However, the biomass of large tanylobus earthworm species was still reduced after 12 month. The importance of these species depends on the type of agricultural system (e.g. in low tillage situations). The expert meeting concluded that risk mitigation measures such as restricting the number of applications should be considered at Member State level. The risk to bees, other soil non target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants, biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of methiocarb.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dimethoate,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.84r/full,"Dimethoate is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dimethoate in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 August 2004. The peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant the Dimethoate EU Joint Submission Group consisting of BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Cheminova A/S and ISAGRO S.p.A.. The Dimethoate EU Joint Submission Group which was represented by Scientific Consulting Company (SCC). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide which comprises broadcast spraying to control biting and sucking insects in wheat, olives, sugar beet, tomatoes and lettuce. Dimethoate can be used as acaricide and insecticide. It should be noted that the applicant is supporting only the use as insecticide in the EU review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Dimethoate 400 EC"" (""400 g/L EC""), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only validated single methods for the determination of residues are available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Dimethoate is of moderate acute oral toxicity to rats (LD50 = 245 mg/kg bw) and mice (LD50 = 160 mg/kg bw) (R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" proposed); it is of low toxicity to rats following acute dermal administration (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw). Inhalation LC50 is 1.68 mg/L (R20 ""Harmful by inhalation"" was proposed). Dimethoate is not irritating to skin or eyes; a data requirement for a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) was set due to the inconclusive results of skin sensitisation (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). Dimethoate is genotoxic in vitro but not in vivo; the overall weight of evidence indicated no significant genotoxic potential. Dimethoate did not show any evidence of carcinogenic, reproductive and developmental toxicity potential. The acute neurotoxicity NOAEL is 1 mg/kg bw/day, and the neuro-developmental NOAEL is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day. With the exception of omethoate, all of the metabolites investigated were of lower acute oral toxicity than dimethoate. The ADI and AOEL are 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, while the ARfD is 0.01 mg/kg bw (safety factor of 100). The overall dermal absorption is 0.15% for the concentrate and 2.0% for the dilution. The operator exposure assessment shows levels below the AOEL only for automatic application on lettuce in greenhouses and for sprayer application on wheat (German model, PPE worn). Bystander exposure and exposure for re-entry workers hand harvesting tomato and lettuce are estimated to be below the AOEL. Sufficient information has been provided on the metabolism of dimethoate in cereal, root and leafy crops. Several metabolic pathways have been identified including oxidation, demethylation, hydroxylation and hydrolysis. At PHI relevant for the supported representative uses, the metabolic pattern is consisting of a mixture of parent compound and a wide range of metabolites. Omethoate is the most toxic metabolite identified, but other metabolites (metabolites XX and XII) presenting a lower potential for cholinesterase inhibition may bring a significant contribution to the toxicological burden given their presence in significantly higher amounts, in particular in cereals. Their relative toxicity to the parent compound needs to be clarified on the basis of further appropriate studies. The proposed residue definition for monitoring is dimethoate and omethoate to be determined separately. Metabolites XX, XII (and possibly III, which is a major rat metabolite, depending on its potential for cholinesterase inhibition potential) should be considered for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment, on the basis of the information to be provided on their relative toxicity to parent compound and their possible specific impact on the toxicological burden. A final decision on the appropriate wording of this residue definition is not possible at this stage, as clear differences in the toxicity levels of dimethoate and its metabolites exist but are reflected by scientifically- based toxicity equivalence factors for omethoate only. Supervised residue trials have been provided allowing the establishment of MRLs in olives, tomatoes, lettuce and wheat for both dimethoate and omethoate. It must be noted that for wheat grown in Southern Europe, the latest application should be limited to growth stage BBCH 69 (end of flowering, as for Northern region) as the provided data do not cover adequately later use until growth stage BBCH 75 (milky grain stage). The nature of residues is affected by processing but only to a significant extent when severe conditions such as sterilisation are applied. However, no specific residue definition is needed for processed commodities as the metabolites formed are similar to those observed in raw commodities under environmental conditions. No significant residues are expected in following crops and in products of animal origin. The expected absence of residues in animal commodities should however be confirmed by a feeding study carried out at the expected rate of exposure of ruminants. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure and risk assessments could be carried out, taking into account the combined effect of dimethoate and omethoate, using toxicity equivalence factors of 3 and 6 for chronic and acute exposures respectively, to take into account the higher toxicity of omethoate. Final and robust assessments will be only possible when the required information concerning metabolites XX, XII and III will be available. At this stage, considering that the exposure to the combined residues of dimethoate and omethoate only is already close to the ADI and the ARfD for some specific population sub-groups, it cannot be excluded that the contribution of further metabolites leads to a global exceedence of the toxicological trigger values for those sub-groups depending on which crops are authorised. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that dimethoate exhibits low persistence in soil. The primary route of dissipation appeared to be microbially-mediated hydrolytic and oxidative degradation in aerobic soil, with a half-life ranging from 2.0 to 4.1 days. Low levels of metabolites were found in the laboratory aerobic degradation study, with two individual metabolites being identified. These were O-desmethyl dimethoate being found at maximum 2.0% AR at day 2 and O, O-dimethyl thiophosphoric acid found at maximum 0.7% AR also on day 2. Other metabolites were detected with the maximum level of individual components at any time being 2.0% AR. However, under field conditions representative for Southern European conditions, the metabolite omethoate was found (peak occurrence of 30.6-67.7% w/w compared to the peak dimethoate levels) though it hadn't been detected in laboratory studies. Because of its toxic potential, further environmental fate testing on this compound was performed. In soil omethoate exhibited very low to low persistence. Anaerobic soil metabolism is a route of dissipation for dimethoate, though less important than aerobic soil metabolism. However, given the supported uses proposed, it appears unlikely that applications of dimethoate will occur during or close to periods when soils experience anaerobic conditions. Dimethoate does not photodegrade on soil. Dimethoate is highly soluble in water and it adsorbs very weakly to soil particles (based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies) and therefore it may be subject to leaching. A column leaching study confirmed the high mobility of dimethoate in soil, with 71.8-100.6% AR eluted from the columns, the majority of which was present as dimethoate. However, in a lysimeter study dimethoate itself was not present in leachate, and a large number of metabolites, including omethoate, could be excluded. Groundwater modelling of the proposed GAPs indicates that contamination of groundwater by either dimethoate or omethoate is unlikely to be a concern, with the exception that exceedance of 0.1 mu g/L may be possible with the proposed GAP with olives. Thus, it is demonstrated that safe uses with respect to groundwater contamination exist for the proposed GAPs, although Member States must reassure themselves that actual use at vulnerable sites under their own local conditions will not lead to exceedance of 0.1 mu g/L. Dimethoate will hydrolyze fairly rapidly in highly alkaline waters (half life at pH 9 is 4.4 days at 25 degrees C), forming O-desmethyl dimethoate and O, O-dimethyl thiophosphoric acid. However, in neutral to acidic waters that also have low microbiological activities, dimethoate can be more persistent. Dimethoate is not susceptible to photodegradation in water. In natural sediment water systems (dark aerobic laboratory study) dimethoate dissipated from the water relatively rapid and incorporation into unextracted residues appeared to be the major route of dissipation. In surface water, dimethoate and O-desmethyl dimethoate were present, with dimethoate in sediment. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for dimethoate and metabolites O-desmethyl dimethoate and O, O-dimethyl thiophosphoric acid. However, Member States need to carry out aquatic exposure and risk assessments form the drainage and runoff routes of exposure to surface water as these routes of entry have not been considered in the EU level assessment available. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half life, contamination in air compartment and long transport trough air are not expected. The applicant should provide a clarification that the test material used in the studies in the section on ecotoxicology covers the specification of the technical material regarding impurities. The risk to birds and mammals from the glasshouse use in lettuce is considered to be low. A potential high risk to birds and mammals was identified in the first tier risk assessment for the representative uses outdoors. A revised refined risk assessment is considered necessary. This should include for birds a more detailed justification for e.g. selection of focal species for all representative outdoor crops, refinements of PD and PT, residues decline (residue data should not be pooled, DT50 for omethoate in ground vegetation from the residue trial in citrus), extrapolation of citrus residues data from southern to northern Europe, use of a dehusking factor. If use is to be made of the HD5-approach then full details of all toxicity values must be provided, the dietary endpoints must be expressed as daily dietary doses and further support for any claimed reduction in uncertainty factors must be presented. The revised refined risk assessment for mammals should address the concerns regarding the residue data and include a better justification for the selection of focal species and for the proposed refinements of PD and PT. The risk to aquatic organisms can be considered as low for the representative uses in lettuce, wheat in southern Europe and sugar beet in northern Europe. The risk to aquatic organisms has to be considered as high for the representative uses in wheat in northern Europe, olives, sugar beet in southern Europe and in tomatoes for which risk mitigation measures such as a bufferzone of 5 metres, 20 metres, 5 metres and 10 metres respectively are considered necessary. The risk to bees is considered to be low for the use in lettuce under glasshouse conditions and the use in sugar beet. For the representative uses outdoors a high risk to bees present in the field at the time of application and for short periods after the treatment(s) was observed in the submitted higher tier studies. The experts' meeting recommends risk mitigation measures such as to avoid all contact with bees. The available data are not sufficient to establish precise withholding periods. A high risk to NTA was observed in the standard first tier laboratory data. The available field studies demonstrated a potential for recovery within one year for uses up to 500 g a.s./ha. The applicant needs to further address the in-field risk to NTA from uses above 500 g a.s./ha. The available field studies at low dose rates were considered sufficient to demonstrate that with appropriate risk mitigation measures such as bufferzones the off-field risk is addressed. Bufferzones of 10 m in wheat (SE) and sugar beet (NE), of 15 m in wheat (NE) and sugar beet (SE), of 30 m in tomatoes and of 75 m in olives are proposed based on the lowest NOEC of 1.44 g a.s./ha from the cereal field trial. The risk to earthworms from dimethoate is considered to be low but a long term toxicity study with the soil metabolite omethoate on earthworms is considered necessary for uses with more than 3 applications per year. The risk to soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oxydemeton-methy,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.86r/full,"Oxydemeton-methyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on oxydemeton-methyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 May 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant, the oxydemeton-methyl Task Force which originally consisted of Bayer AG and United Phosphorus Limited. The Task Force membership changed. Bayer AG has transferred the property of oxydemeton-methyl to IRVITA Plant Protection Branch. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises application by orchard air-blast sprayers and by tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers to control aphids in pome fruit and cereals (excluding oats). The maximum total dose for cereals is 0.25 kg oxydemeton-methyl (ODM) per hectare and for pome fruit it is 0.75 kg ODM per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Metasystox 250 EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in pome fruit can be analysed with a multi-method (The German S16 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of oxydemeton - methyl. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Oxydemeton-methyl is toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin and by inhalation. It is irritating to eyes and may cause sensitisation by skin contact. The main acute, short-term or long-term toxic effect is an inhibition of blood and brain cholinesterase activities in all tested mammalian species. Another target organ in rodents is the epididymis, but the mode of action is not fully understood and the relevance for humans is unknown. Oxydemeton-methyl is not teratogenic, not oncogenic in rodents, and shows no evidence of delayed neurotoxicity (in hens). The compound has clear mutagenic and clastogenic properties in vitro but has no genotoxic potential in vivo. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0003 mg/kg bw/day, the agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, and the agreed Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) 0.0015 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The estimated and measured operator exposures are higher than the AOEL for the use on pome fruits and cereals (>70 times the AOEL without PPE in the German model), even with the use of personal protective equipment (>3 times the AOEL in the German model). The worker and bystander exposures exceed the AOEL in the pome fruit scenario. The metabolism of oxydemeton-methyl has been investigated in apples. Initial reactions are the oxidation of the sulphur in the side chain leading to M01(3), demethylation of the ester moieties and hydrolysis of the P-S-bond, followed by further oxidation processes. M01 and metabolite M07(4) have to be considered due to their structural profile as cholinesterase inhibitors. In metabolism studies performed on other crops, another metabolite with the intact organophosphorous structure was identified (metabolite M06(5)). As the metabolic pattern in plant commodities at harvest indicates that metabolites may contribute significantly to the toxicological burden, the residue definition for risk assessment in plant products is proposed to include the parent compound, and metabolites M01, M06 and M07, to allow a reliable assessment of the safety of the consumer to be conducted. The residue definition for monitoring can be restricted to the parent compound and M01, as indicator compounds. A metabolism study on cereals is required for confirmation of the validity of these residue definitions for this crop group. The conducted supervised residue trials analysed only the parent compound and M01 and due to deficiencies are not appropriate for MRL setting. A complete data base of supervised residue trials should be submitted with analysis of residues according to the residue definition for risk assessment. The provided information on processed commodities is very limited and suggests that residues are transferred to apple juice and sauce. However the information is restricted to the levels of the parent compound and its sulfone metabolite, and no balance studies are provided. The need for further information in particular on the effect of processing on the nature of the residues should be examined at Member State level, given the high toxicity of oxydemeton-methyl, and considering the results of the required residue trials. No residues are expected in following crops and no plant-back interval is needed. The animal metabolism was investigated in ruminants and poultry, and different metabolic patterns are observed. In ruminants the major constituents of the residues are the parent compound and M01, while metabolite M07 is clearly the dominant compound in poultry tissues and eggs. The residue definitions for monitoring and risk assessment in animal commodities are proposed to include the parent compound, M01 and metabolite M07 in a conservative approach. No MRL proposal for animal commodities can be made given the lack of information on the actual level of exposure of animals to toxicologically relevant compound. A reliable consumer risk assessment could not be performed at this stage as no reliable information is available on the residue levels in plant commodities. In soil oxydemeton-methyl exhibited very low to low persistence. Significant sinks for the C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic laboratory studies were residue not extracted by methanol or methanol/water (17-20% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 90 days ethane label and 20% AR after 49 days methoxy label) and mineralisation to CO2 (6.6-38% AR after 90 days ethane label & 79% AR after 49 days methoxy label) The breakdown products identified in soil extracts were: M01 (max. 6.3% AR at 3 days), M05(6) (max. 9.5% AR at 4 days), M09(7) (max. 39% AR at 2 days), M10(8) (max. 26.5% AR at 365 days) and DMP9 (max. 45.8% AR at 1 day). These breakdown products all exhibited very low or low persistence with the exception of M05 which exhibited moderate persistence. Under anaerobic conditions in soil laboratory studies the breakdown products M02(10) (max 6.2% AR at 13 days), and M22(11) (max 22% AR at 13 days) not found under aerobic conditions were identified. Oxydemeton-methyl, M01, M09, M10 and M02 exhibited very high soil mobility in guideline batch adsorption studies. M05 would be expected to exhibit very high mobility on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) computer modelling. In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments (22 degrees C), oxydemeton-methyl exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 2.3-3.4 days) primarily as a consequence of biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolites M01 (max. 0.9% AR), M02 (max. 3.4% AR), M06 (max. <9.4%AR) M07 (max. 18%AR), M09 (max. 9.9%AR), M10 (max. 5.1%AR) and M11(12)/M21(13) (max 22.3%AR) were identified and considered to need addressing in the aquatic risk assessment. Partitioning of extractable parent oxydemeton-methyl and the metabolites to sediment was limited, however residues not extracted from sediment by methanol or methanol: water represented a significant sink for the applied radioactivity (45-66%AR at study end, 91 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the ethane-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for 29-31 % AR by 91 days. Investigations with oxydemeton-methyl with a methoxy radiolabel were not available. Therefore it cannot be excluded that DMP may be present in significant amounts in natural water systems. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with the soil metabolites M05, M09 and DMP has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for M05, M09 and DMP from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure to surface water at the national level, should oxydemeton-methyl be included in Annex 1. Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is available for oxydemeton-methyl and its soil metabolites: M01, M09 and M10 for some of the potential applied for representative uses on cereals and the use on apples. Modelling was also available for the soil metabolite M05 but data gaps were identified for further substance properties for this metabolite. Consequently the groundwater exposure estimates available for M05 discussed in this conclusion are preliminary. Based on the groundwater modelling results annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil column (that do not cover all the possible applied for representative uses on cereals) were < 0.1 mu g/L for oxydemeton-methyl, M01 and M09 at all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For 2 of the 9 scenarios concentrations of M10 were predicted to be > 0.1 mu g/L (up to 0.23 mu g/L). Using the available results for M05 that may underestimate leaching potential, the annual average recharge concentrations were > 0.1 mu g/L at all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. (Preliminary values ranged from 0.17-2.86 mu g/L. Therefore non relevance assessments were triggered for M05 and M10. A clarification is needed whether or not the test material used in the section on ecotoxicology covers the specification of the technical material regarding the impurities and furthermore the composition of the tested premix products needs to be clarified. A potential high risk to birds was identified. The experts' meeting accepted the residue data, the residue decline data, the use of a MAF and food in take values (except for yellow wagtail). Further justification of the relevance of focal bird species to southern Member States is required as well as a consideration of the skylark as a focal species in cereals in northern Member States. As regards the other refinements factors, the meeting had reservations and hence further justification is required before these can be incorporated into a refined risk assessment. A PD of 0.764 large insects/0.236 small insects was accepted for yellow wagtail. Also a potential high risk to mammals was identified. As for birds the meeting accepted the new residue data, the residue decline data and the use of a MAF figure. As regards the other refinement options, the meeting had reservations and hence further justification is required before these can be incorporated in a refined risk assessment. Furthermore, the risk to birds and mammals from the metabolite M01 needs to be addressed. Chironomus riparius is the most sensitive aquatic organisms on an acute time-scale when tested with the lead formulation Metasystox R 250 EC. As the EC50 for this species is at least 10 times lower than the EC50 for D. magna, the EFSA considers a chronic study on Chironomus sp. necessary. A high risk to aquatic organisms from oxydemeton-methyl was identified for which risk mitigation measures such as bufferzones of 15 m in cereals and 100 m in orchards are considered necessary. The acute studies on D. magna with oxydemeton-methyl 50% premix and the metabolite M02 should be repeated as the test concentrations were not analytically verified. Based on the available assumption for C. riparius a high risk was identified for M01 and M02 for both representative uses evaluated. The acute risk from M07, M09, M10 and M11 to aquatic organisms can be regarded as low for both representative uses evaluated. The experts' meeting decided that the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates of the metabolites M07, M09 and M11 needs to be addressed. The EFSA considers such a study also necessary for metabolite M10 as this is a major metabolite in groundwater. Studies to address the risk from the metabolites M05, M06, M21 and DMP are considered necessary. A high risk to bees was identified which must be managed at Member State level. The available studies were not sufficient to establish a withholding period. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop. A high risk to non-target arthropods was observed in the laboratory and extended laboratory studies. Further higher tier studies were submitted to address this risk. The EFSA is of the opinion that further data is needed to address the risk to non-target arthropods for both uses evaluated. The risk to earthworms and soil-micro-organisms from oxydemeton-methyl, M01, M09 and M10 can be regarded as low. Further studies to address the risk to earthworms and soil-micro-organisms from the metabolite DMP are considered necessary. M01 and M02 have a comparable insecticidal activity as the parent compound. A further clarification of the tested dose rates in the biological screening data for M07 and M10 is needed to conclude on the biological relevance of these metabolites. A study on the effects of oxydemeton-methyl on non-target plants was still awaited during the EPCO meeting. Biological screening data for the ground water metabolite M05 and DMP are considered necessary. The risk to soil non-target macro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment can be regarded as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance methomyl,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.83r,"Methomyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on methomyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 May 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 June 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main applicant DuPont de Nemours. Makhteshim Agan ICC also submitted a dossier which the rapporteur Member State considered to be substantially incomplete. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide comprise foliar spraying to control biting and sucking insects in cucumber, courgette, tomato and eggplants. Only the use as insecticide was evaluated. It should be noted that the use in grape was withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Methomyl 20 SL"", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methomyl is highly toxic via the oral, ocular and inhalation routes of exposure, but it has a low toxicity via the dermal route. On the basis of the data package available the proposed classification is T+, R26 'ery toxic by inhalation' and R25 'oxic if swallowed'. It is not an eye or skin irritant and does not cause skin sensitisation. The overall short term NOAEL is approximately 10 mg/kg bw/day. Reliable data on effects on cholinesterase activity were not always determined. Based on the available studies, the weight of the evidence indicates that methomyl does not pose a genotoxic, reproductive or developmental concern. There was no evidence of methomyl-induced carcinogenic activity in rats or mice. The NOAEL for acute neurotoxicity is 0.25 mg/kg bw. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD were set at 0.0025 mg/kg bw, based on the acute neurotoxicity NOAEL applying a SF of 100. The operator, worker and bystander risk assessment should be regarded as inconclusive, since the rapporteur Member State recalculated operator, worker and bystander exposure with dermal absorption values slightly different from the ones agreed during the experts' meeting; however, the assessment is not expected to change significantly even with the use of values agreed during the experts' meeting. The operator exposure estimates exceed the AOEL in all scenarios considered. The metabolism of methomyl in fruits is fully elucidated. Four metabolic pathways were identified generally leading to metabolites of no toxicological concern, as formed as a result of hydrolysis of the carbamate ester link and further degradation. However at least 2 metabolites were identified with intact carbamate structure (IN-HUZ57 and IN-G6520) and are considered as toxicologically relevant. In fruits, these metabolites are present at much lower levels than the parent compound and their contribution to the global toxicological burden is expected to be minor. Therefore, only the parent compound is proposed to be included in the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in fruit crops. For other commodities dealt with at member state level, the need for inclusion of these metabolites in the residue definition for risk assessment should be carefully considered as it appears that their ratio to the parent compound may be significant on leafy parts of plants, based on information obtained on grape foliage. A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials were conducted in accordance with the supported representative uses, demonstrating that a MRL of 0.5 mg/kg would be needed for table and wine grapes, while residues in fruiting vegetables are consistently below the Limit Of Quantification (0.02 mg/kg) of the analysis method. In processed commodities (grape juice and wine), residues are lower than in raw grapes, this resulting from a preferential transfer to solid fractions during processing and from a partial degradation of methomyl to methomyl oxime. This degradation product has however no toxicological relevance. On the basis of the supported representative uses dealt with under this peer review, no livestock exposure to methomyl residues is expected. Due to the low persistency of methomyl in soil, no residue of methomyl is expected in following crops. Acute and chronic exposure assessments to methomyl residues were performed. A potential acute risk was identified for all considered population subgroups resulting from the consumption of treated table grapes. Degradation of methomyl under dark aerobic conditions in soil does not produce any major metabolite. Taking into consideration also studies performed with thiodicarb (where methomyl appears as metabolite) methomyl is low or moderate persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. Unextractable residues accounted for up to 32.2 % AR after 30 d and CO2 for 75.4 % AR after 92 d. No new soil metabolites were identified in the soil photolysis study. Acetonitrile was detected as the major volatile metabolite. The meeting of MS experts considered that the potential environmental contamination by acetonitrile derived from the use of methomyl will be insignificant with respect to other anthropogenic sources. Under normal environmental conditions microbial degradation in soil is likely to predominate over the photolytic one. In the available field studies for thiodicarb, field degradation half lives of thiodicarb and methomyl were longer than the ones measured under laboratory conditions. The rapporteur Member State normalized the field dissipation rates for methomyl using the average soil temperatures over the period resulting in corrected half lives in the range of those observed in laboratory studies. Since the half life originally used to calculate PEC in soil was derived from a study finally not considered adequate, new PEC soil were calculated and reported in an addendum. Worst case laboratory half life of 15.2 d was used. Two applications of 450 g/ha with an interval of 14 d were calculated as a worst case representative use. Interception of 60 % (corresponding to leaf development BBCH 50) was assumed for vines and 70 % (corresponding to BBCH 20 onwards for tomatoes) was assumed for vegetables. However, the proposed representative uses do not restrict the application to any particular growing stage. Therefore, EFSA calculated peak PEC soil for tomatoes considering leaf development stages (growing stages BBCH 10-19; 50 % interception) in the updated addendum. Methomyl is very high mobile in soil. A column (3 soils) and an aged column (1 soil) leaching studies are available for methomyl. In the column leaching study methomyl in leachate represented 6.6 - 55 % AR. Methomyl oxime was observed up to 2.2 % AR in soil and 1.7 % AR in leachate. In the aged column study, the major radioactive component in the leachate (5 % AR) co-chromatographed with methomyl. Neither hydrolysis nor photolysis are expected to contribute significantly to the degradation of methomyl in the aqueous environment. Methomyl is not ready biodegradable. In water / sediment systems, methomyl partitions to the sediment to levels up to 11.4 % AR after one day. Degradation occurred with half lives between 2.5 to 4.8 days in the whole systems. Dissipation from the water phase was between 3.5 and 4.5 d. Unextractable residues in the sediment reached a maximum of 20.1 % AR after 14 d declining to 14.7 % AR at the end of the study (102 d). CO2 reached a maximum of 32.1 - 72.3 % AR at the end of the studies. Acetonitrile appears as a major metabolite in some systems both in the sediment and as volatile metabolite. The meeting of MS experts considered that the potential environmental contamination by acetonitrile derived from the use of methomyl will be insignificant with respect to other anthropogenic sources. PECSW / SED values for parent methomyl were calculated based only in spray drift loadings and considering two categories. The first category is 'late grapes and listed tall vegetables' (i.e. tomatoes and grapes post-flowering) and the second category is 'listed low vegetables' (i.e. courgettes and aubergines). For cucumber it is necessary for Member States to consider which category cucumbers fit into under their growing regimes. The values were recalculated for a water phase half life of 4.5 d in the addendum. The potential of ground water contamination by methomyl and its minor soil metabolite methomyl oxime was simulated by the applicant and recalculated by the rapporteur Member State for the representative uses in vines and tomatoes with FOCUS PRZM 2.2.1 and FOCUS PEARL 1.1.1 models for all relevant scenarios. None of the crop / scenario combination exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L on the 80th percentile annual average concentrations neither for methomyl nor for methomyl oxime. Concentration of methomyl in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. Methomyl is intended to be used in cucumber/courgette, tomato/eggplant and grape (table & wine). The use in grapes is not longer supported by the applicant for the EU review process (i.e. with respect to Annex I inclusion). Nevertheless the risk from this originally intended use is reported in the section on ecotoxicology as far as the risk assessment is available. Based on the assessment according to EPPO (1992) the short and long term risk to birds can be regarded as low. The first tier acute risk to insectivorous birds is considered to be high. The applicant should be asked to address the acute risk from methomyl on the same basis as was done by the PPR Panel for pirimicarb. Furthermore the applicant is requested to provide a first tier risk assessment based on SANCO/4145/2000 and the dietary and reproduction endpoints for birds in terms of mg a.s./kg bw/day and a revised risk assessment. Based on the assessment according to EPPO (1992) both the acute and the long term risk to herbivorous mammals in grapes have to be regarded as high. Based on a weight of evidence approach, this long term risk was considered to be addressed. The acute risk from methomyl should be refined by the applicant on the same basis as was done by the PPR Panel for pirimicarb. A low risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in cucumber/ courgette and tomato/eggplant if calculated according to EPPO (1992). The EFSA recalculated the first tier risk to birds and mammals according to SANCO/4145/2000. Based on this risk assessment the short term risk to birds can be regarded as low but a high acute and long term risk was identified as well as a high acute and long term risk to mammals for all representative uses evaluated. Therefore the applicant is requested to submit a refinement of the long term risk to birds and mammals if the risk is assessed according to the latest guidance document (SANCO/4145/2000). For the acute risk to birds and mammals see outstanding data gap discussed above. A risk for birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water was identified which the EFSA proposes to be addressed. A high risk to aquatic organisms was identified for which risk mitigation measures such as a buffer zone of 50 metres for 'late grapes and listed tall vegetables' and a buffer zone of 30 metres for 'listed low vegetables' should be taken into account. A high risk to bees was identified. Risk mitigation measures to avoid all contact with bees are considered necessary. No data to establish a withholding period is available. A high risk to non-target arthropods was identified. The applicant is asked to refine the risk assessment for non-target arthropods for both the in-field and off-field areas. The risk can only be concluded once this data becomes available but risk mitigation measure will possibly be necessary. The acute risk to earthworms is considered to be low. In addition also the long term risk to earthworms can be considered as low for the representative uses in cucumber/courgette and tomato/eggplant for growth stages from BBCH 20 onwards. A long term risk to earthworms in grapes and in fruiting vegetables before growth stage BBCH 20 was identified. It is proposed that the applicant should address this risk. The risk to soil micro-organisms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diazinon,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.85r,"Diazinon is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diazinon in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 8 July 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 9 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6-7 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses in Southern Europe as an insecticide and acaricide as proposed by the applicant with application via orchard air blast sprayers and tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers. Application is made to apples and pears with a maximum total dose of 2.7 kg diazinon per hectare and to sugar beet with a maximum total dose of 0.72 kg diazinon per hectare. It should be noted that the use in apples and pears were withdrawn during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Diazol 60 EC, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. However, it should be noted that full validation of the method of analysis for food commodities is not available as no independent laboratory validation data are available. As well as this further validation data are required for the method of analysis for air. Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding data gaps for the relevant impurities. Acute toxicity during oral exposure is higher than by dermal application or inhalation. Therefore the proposed classification is Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". The main effect observed during short term or long term exposure is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity. Based on this, the relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day in the dog studies. There is no genotoxic potential for diazinon, no carcinogenic effect in rats and mice, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. No delayed neurotoxicity was observed in hens, and the NOAEL in the subchronic neurotoxicity study with rats is the same as the short term NOAEL, based on acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. The groundwater metabolites G 27550(3) and GS 31144(4) are not considered toxicologically significant, having no phosphate group susceptible to produce acetyl cholinesterase inhibition. They were concluded not relevant. The three impurities TEPP5, O, S-TEP6 and S, S-TEPP7 were very toxic in acute oral studies and considered of toxicological concern. Acute and subchronic human studies were submitted, but were either not acceptable, or had scientific deficiencies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.025 mg/kg bw, with the use of the safety factor 100. For the supported use on sugar beets, the estimated operator exposure according to the German or the UK models is largely above the AOEL, with or without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) (2700% of the AOEL with the use of PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) according to the German model). The metabolism of diazinon in plants is clearly elucidated. The degradation pathway proceeds first through hydrolysis of the phosphorothioate ester link, leading to metabolite G 27550, which given its chemical structure has no cholinesterase activity. This compound is further hydroxylated and conjugated to glucose. Diazoxon is not observed. The amount of metabolites in comparison to the parent level is variable from crop to crop, but the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound only for monitoring and risk assessment as no other compound expected to add a contribution to the toxicological effects of diazinon was identified. Supervised residue trials were conducted suggesting the setting of a MRL at 0.5 mg/kg in pome fruits, and indicating that residues in sugar beet roots are below 0.01 mg/kg. No residues are expected in following crops and no plant- back restriction is needed. Processing of apples leads to a clear reduction of the diazinon levels in juice and sauce. However, the formation of a degradation product (desethyl diazinon), identified under specific hydrolysis conditions, was not investigated in practical conditions. This compound is recommended for inclusion in the residue definition for risk assessment in processed commodities. The metabolism of diazinon in livestock has been investigated and parent compound was found to be the major compound of toxicological relevance in animal tissues. Diazinon exhibits a lipophilic behaviour. Two metabolites, diazoxon and a hydroxylated form of diazinon were also present. The residue definition in animal commodities can be restricted to diazinon on the basis of the representative uses considered in this peer-review, leading to a low livestock dietary exposure and non significant transfer of residues to animal tissues, as demonstrated by feeding studies. The short and long term exposure assessments were conducted and indicated potential exceedences of the ADI and ARfD, which in some cases appear to be severe, in particular for infants and toddlers, with high consumption levels of pome fruits. In soil diazinon exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant sinks for the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used in the aerobic laboratory studies were residue not extracted by acetonitrile: water or methanol/water (9-38% of applied radioactivity (AR) after 76-119 days) and mineralisation to CO2 5.8-86% AR at 76-119 days. The major (>10% AR) metabolite in soil extracts was G 27550 accounting for up to 82% AR which exhibited high soil persistence. This metabolite may have the potential to accumulate in soil if applications are made to the same field in successive years. Diazinon exhibited medium to low soil mobility and G 27550 exhibited very high mobility based on the results of guideline batch laboratory adsorption experiments. The minor soil degradation product (max. 4.7% AR) GS 31144 was also characterised as exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) computer modelling. In aerobic laboratory natural sediment water system experiments, diazinon exhibited low persistence (dissipation DT50 in water 3.9-4.7 days) as a consequence of a combination of partitioning to sediment (accounting for up to 77%AR at 0 days) and biodegradation. In the water phase the metabolite G 27550 accounted for a maximum of 47%AR 30 days after application, levels subsequently declined (DT50 in water estimated at 87 days). G 27550 was also present in sediment (maximum 22.7%AR). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile and acetonitrile: water represented 22-49%AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 of the pyridine ring-C-14-radiolabel used accounted for only 4.7-5.1 % AR by 100 days. The available surface water exposure assessment just considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water. The potential exposure of surface water with parent diazinon and the soil metabolite G 27550 via the drainage and runoff routes of entry has not been assessed in the available EU level exposure assessment. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment for diazinon and G 27550 from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level, should diazinon be included in Annex 1. Appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling is not available. This is required. Based on the available FOCUS PEARL modelling that utilised too favourable input parameters, annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil column >0.75 mu g/L are already indicated for G 27550. For GS 31144 these concentrations are indicated to be >0.1 mu g/L. Based on current information it cannot be excluded that these concentrations for GS 31144 may be shown by appropriate modelling to be >0.75 mu g/L. Non relevance assessments are therefore required for both these potential groundwater contaminants. A significant dissipation route of diazinon from plants and soil will be volatilisation to the atmosphere. However calculated relatively rapid photooxidation through reaction with the hydroxyl radicals present in the upper atmosphere, indicate that diazinon is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport. A high acute, short and long term risk for insectivorous birds was identified in the first tier assessment for both evaluated uses. Based on actual measured concentrations of diazinon and degradation of residues in orchards the short and long term risk in apples/pears is considered low. However, the high acute risk remains. For sugar beet no valid residue data are available to refine the assessment. A high long term risk to insectivorous mammals was identified in both sugar beet and orchards. A risk for secondary poisoning was identified for earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in orchards and for earthworm-eating mammals for the use in sugar beet. Diazinon is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures comparable to 30 m buffer zones are required in orchards, and to 5 m in sugar beet. The toxicity to bees is high. Sugar beet is however not attractive to bees and application in orchards is late in the season after flowering. The risk to bees is therefore considered to be low. Non-target arthropods outside the field would be affected from the treatment in orchards. A potential for recolonisation has been shown in an aged residue study. However, a prerequisite for recolonisation from off-field non-target arthropod populations is that off-field populations are not affected. Therefore the risk to off-field non-target arthropods needs to be further addressed for the use in orchards. The acute risk to earthworms from diazinon and the soil metabolites is low and long term studies are not considered necessary. However, the risk to earthworms and other soil macro-organisms from the more persistent metabolite G 27550 needs to be addressed for a full conclusion. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbofuran,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.90r,"Carbofuran is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbofuran in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants FMC Chemical sprl and Dianica S.A.. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects where maize, sugar beet or sunflowers will be grew at an application rate of 0.6 kg carbofuran per hectare. Carbofuran can be used as acaricide, insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were Furadan 5G, a granule (GR) and Diafuran 5G, a micrcogranule (MG). Both are registered in some Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, soil and water. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Carbofuran is rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted in the rat. It is very toxic by ingestion (LD50 7 mg/kg bw) and by inhalation (LC50 0.05 mg/L) whereas toxicity during dermal exposure is moderate. Carbofuran is not a skin irritant or eye irritant or skin sensitizer but mortality was reported after exposure to eyes. The proposed classification is T+ , R28/R26 ""Very toxic if swallowed and via inhalation"", Xn, R21 ""Harmful in contact with skin"" and T, 39/41 ""Danger of very serious irreversible effects"" and Risk for serious damage to eyes"". The critical target is inhibition of brain and RBC acethylcholinesterase. The overall relevant oral short term NOAEL is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog studies. It is genotoxic in vitro but negative in in vivo studies. The relevant long term NOAEL is 0.462 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Carbofuran induced decreased body weight in pups as well as pup survival. Furthermore, results from the open literature demonstrated that carbofuran caused testicular and spermatotoxicity in pups at dose levels of 0.4 mg/kg bw not associated with inducing general toxic effects. The classification of Reproduction Toxic Category 3, R62, is proposed. The metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran and 3-keto carbofuran are toxic (LD50 of 8 and 107 mg/kg bw, respectively), the hydroxy metabolite is genotoxic as well (Ames test). The dermal absorption value for the granular formulations, Diafuran 5G or Furadan 5G, is 10%. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.001 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose is 0.001 mg/kg bw with the safety factor of 100 applied should be regarded as provisional due to the concerns in relation to possible reproduction effects. Thus, the estimated exposure should also be considered as provisional. However, if the AOEL is confirmed, the estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED is below the AOEL i.e. 53% if PPE and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is worn and assuming a maximum work rate of 10 ha/day, see table below. Worker exposure is unlikely to occur, as the formulation is incorporated mechanical means into the soil when sowing. The granular formulation is applied by ground-directed equipment that is nearly dusted free; therefore, the level of bystander exposure to vapour or airborne particles at the time of application is likely to be negligible. At the time of finalisation of this conclusion, it was noted at the EFSA Evaluation meeting in June 2006 that the new study on spermatogenesis in rats had been provided to the rapporteur and also to the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) at Ispra, IT for consideration as part of the classification process (March, 2006). In March 2006, the ECB classification meeting proposed that no classification for reproduction was required. EFSA understands from ECB that this conclusion was reached taking into account the results of the new study, which did not confirm the testicular and spermatotoxicity effects in rats reported in published papers. Thus, this position, reached within the ECB process, would support a confirmation of the reference values i.e. ADI, ARfD and AOEL that was provisionally agreed at the mammalian toxicology experts 'meeting (EPCO 33), and a conclusion that no additional safety factor would be required. However it should be noted that the classification proposal has not been formally adopted by a vote within the ECB process nor have the results of the study been considered or peer reviewed within the risk assessment process under Directive 91/414/EEC. The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbofuran was investigated in various crops and with different methods of application. Moreover, studies with benfuracarb and carbosulfan were considered applicable to address carbofuran metabolism in plants. Based on all submitted data the metabolic pathway of carbofuran in soil applied uses can be considered as sufficiently investigated. Carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, a need to address carbofuran residues in succeeding crops was identified. Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in sugar beet, maize and sunflower seed indicated that residues were low and mostly below the respective LOQ. In livestock animals, carbofuran undergoes an extensive metabolisation. No significant total residues are expected to occur in edible animal matrices taking into account the residue situation for the representative use indicated by the data currently available. Consumer risk was assessed for carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran in the DAR but the assessment was not updated and not agreed on during the peer review process. Based on the initial assessment presented in the DAR the estimated chronic dietary intake of carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran is expected to be below the ADI provisionally agreed by EPCO 33. A slight exceedance of the ARfD noted for toddlers consuming maize in the available estimates is primarily caused by the limited sensitivity of the analytical methods applied in the residue trials. On basis of the laboratory degradation experiments, carbofuran may be from low to high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. In one of the experiments the metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran exceed the 10 % AR. Carbofuran-7-phenol reached the 9 % AR at the end of one of the aerobic experiments and the transformation product 3-OH-carbofuran was identified as a minor metabolite in various experiments (max 1.32 % AR). Additionally, the rapporteur Member State included in the list of end points degradation parameters obtained in the studies performed with benfuracarb and carbosulfan. Only carbofuran-7-phenol was identified as major metabolite in the validated anaerobic study. In this anaerobic study carbofuran is low persistent. In the field studies performed with parent carbofuran in USA (FMC) metabolites 3-OH-carborfuran, 3-keto carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol were analyzed. Results are only reported as total carbamate for some of the trials and it is not possible to know the exact amount of each metabolite. In other trials, 3-OH-carborfuran is found at levels up to the 3 % of the total residue and 3-keto-carbofuran at levels up to approx. 20 % of the total residue. Carbofuran-7-phenol is not found above the LOD in any of the trials. In the field studies performed with parent carbofuran in USA (FMC) metabolites 3-OH-carborfuran, 3-keto carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol were analyzed. Results are only reported as total carbamate for some of the trials and it is not possible to know the exact amount of each metabolite. In other trials, 3-OH-carborfuran is found at levels up to the 3 % of the total residue and 3-ketocarbofuran at levels up to approx. 20 % of the total residue. Carbofuran-7-phenol is not found above the LOD in any of the trials. Summaries of some field studies performed carbosulfan (EU, reported in the carbosulfan DAR) as parent compound were provided by one applicant (FMC). Addendum including the data from these studies has been provided by the rapporteur Member State in April 2006; however the complete assessment of the studies is still missing in this addendum. Half life of carbofuran in the EU trials (where it appears as metabolite of carbosulfan) ranges between 1.3 to 71.9 d. Half life of carbofuran in the USA sites (where it is applied as parent compound), assessed as relevant for the EU climatic conditions by the rapporteur Member State, ranges between 5 and 121 d. However, only the carbosulfan field studies performed in EU were used by the rapporteur Member State in the risk assessment of carbofuran. The meeting of the experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper from the applicants is available (June 2005) but has not been assessed and peer reviewed. Also the meeting of experts agreed that it is necessary to determine whether the studies from the USA are acceptable for the EU risk assessment. Based on the available information, carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil. No information on the degradation rate of metabolites is available in the DAR. Rate of degradation in soil should be estimated for the metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, 3-keto-carbofuran, carbofuran-7phenol to complete the FOCUS-GW calculations required. PEC soil presented in the DAR are based on the worst case EU field half life (DT50 = 71.9 d) determined for carbofuran in the carbosulfan field studies. Evaluation meeting agreed that the appropriateness of using this value need to be discussed by the experts meeting. The meeting of experts was not able to conclude on this due to the lack of relevant information for the field studies in the DAR. An addendum from the rapporteur Member State assessing the position paper of the applicants and providing further details on the field studies is awaited. In case dissipation half life of 71.9 d is found to be inappropriate, PECS will need to be recalculated. Carbofuran may be classified as very high mobile compound. A data gap for further batch adsorption/desorption studies on carbofuran soil metabolites are necessary to complete the FOCUS-GW calculations. An aged column leaching study shows that carbofuran and its metabolites (3-keto-carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol) are mobile and may leach under the conditions of the experiments. No lysimeter studies were available for carbofuran. One of the applicants (FMC) presented two lysimeter studies not provided in the original dossier (June 2005). These studies have not been assessed and peer reviewed. In aqueous buffer solutions, carbofuran is stable at pH 4 and degrades with half lives of 28 - 45.7 d at pH 7 and 0.1 d at pH 9. Carbofuran-7-phenol was the major hydrolysis product identified. Photolysis may contribute only slightly to the degradation of carbofuran in water. Carbofuran is not readily biodegradable according the available study. Dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 41 d. Mineralization was low and bound residue reached a maximum of level of 32.8 % AR. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 5.3-6.9 d and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 7.8 - 11.6 d. The only major metabolite found in the water phase was carbofuran-7-phenol. Only carbofuran reached levels above 10 % AR in the sediment. Bound residues reached maximum of 74 - 78 % AR at the end of the study ( 102 d). These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems. The two applicants proposed different approaches to estimate the potential contamination of surface water. None of these approaches follows FOCUS SW scheme. Since the input parameters selected to calculate PECSW and the assumptions made were not fully justified, the rapporteur Member State considered that more appropriate PECSW calculations were necessary to finalize the assessment of the EU representative uses and proposed the use of FOCUS SW scheme. Available FOCUS GW modelling shows that trigger of 0.1 mu g/L was exceeded for four of the eight maize relevant scenarios, four of the nine sugar beet scenarios and one of the two relevant sunflower scenarios. However, this calculation does not take into account the data from the other applicant, which shows that carbofuran may be significantly more persistent in soil. In the case of sugar beet and sunflower the product was assumed to be applied only every three or two years respectively, this limitation is not indicated in the table of representative uses proposed by the applicants. The meeting of the experts identified a new data gap for new FOCUS PECGW taking into account all the information available on the rate of degradation of carbofuran and to address the potential groundwater contamination by carbofuran soil metabolites. Carbofuran is not expected to be prone to long range transport through the air compartment. An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided the 18th of May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Therefore, studies submitted by the applicant after the DAR was submitted are considered neither evaluated nor peer-reviewed in this conclusion. Substantial data requirements to address the risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules, ingestion of treated seedlings and contaminated earthworms were identified in the DAR by the rapporteur Member State. The aquatic risk assessment based on PECsw from drainage resulted in a high acute and chronic risk to aquatic invertebrates. New studies and a refined risk assessment were submitted. The risk to bees for the use in sugar beets is considered to be low because no exposure is expected. Exposure of bees via pollen and nectar is possible for the use in maize and sunflowers. A risk to bees cannot be excluded for the representative uses in maize and sunflowers on the basis of the peer reviewed data. Further studies on the oral toxicity to bees were submitted The risk to non-target arthropods was not sufficiently addressed. The experts 'meeting on ecotoxicology confirmed the data requirement and identified also the need for studies with soil dwelling non-target macro organisms. A high long-term risk to earthworms cannot be excluded from the peer reviewed data. New information was submitted by the applicants. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms was considered to be low on the basis of data submitted by FMC. A data requirement was set for the applicants to address the risk to other non-target organisms. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. An addendum to the chapter on ecotoxicology has been provided on the 18th of May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfop-P (haloxyfop-R) finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.87r,"Although, in general, the Commission is using the ISO common names for the active substances, in this case the synonym haloxyfop-R (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) is used, which is in common use, but has no official status. However, to minimise confusion and misunderstandings the name haloxyfop-R is used in the EFSA conclusion, being aware that this is not in compliance with the general approach of the Commission. Haloxyfop-R is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-R in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-R in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet at a maximum application rate up to 0.104 kg haloxyfop-R per hectare. Only the use as herbicide was evaluated during the EU peer review process. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""EF-1400"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Whether or not sufficient enforcement methods are available for monitoring purposes depends on the final residue definitions. The reason is that none of the submitted method is enantio selective. The residues are determined as a sum parameter of both, the R- and the S-isomer. This means that for the determination of haloxyfop-R no specific enforcement method would be available. Furthermore, it should be noted that with the available analytical methods for food, soil and water it is not possible to differentiate between residue of the acid and its salts, esters and conjugates. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (>98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-R methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-R. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-R. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i.e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-R methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-R methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day. There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-R. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation. No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f(1a) pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for maternal effects is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the first study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the second study. No specific studies are available for the metabolites. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw/day, with the safety factor of 100 applied. The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model. The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL. To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-R in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop R-isomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used. Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R,S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R,S) again. Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R,S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R,S) in either form, free and conjugated. Due to the lacking isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S- to the R-isomer. A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-R methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-R methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-R methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed. The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure. Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-R methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-R-3 (maxima concentrations ranged from 53 to 91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridinol(4) (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(5) and DE-535 phenol(6), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-R can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent and DE-535 pyridinone as high persistent. Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-R, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-R and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-R methyl ester and all its metabolites. Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-R, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil. The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-R methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50=43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. Because a final conclusion on the ecotoxicological and toxicological relevance of this metabolite can not be drawn, the aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan needs to be addressed. Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-R methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-R, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8 - 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-R) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-R methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-R ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase). The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-R methyl ester, haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling indicated that there is a high potential of groundwater contamination from the metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) under vulnerable situations for all the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However, the DT50 values used in the modelling were derived with a method not compatible with the method assumed by the PELMO model as recommended by the FOCUS group. Therefore, the values presented in this conclusion should be taken with caution and should be confirmed by an appropriate FOCUS groundwater modelling. Pending the outcome, an evaluation of the relevance of the metabolites following the guidance document on relevant metabolites has to be completed. In the case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L or 0.75 mu g/L is exceeded there is a need to provide information on the toxicological properties and possibly consumer risk assessment. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected. The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The MS experts did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values are foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals needs to be further addressed. Haloxyfop-R methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-R and DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be low, except for sediment dwelling organisms for which a reproduction study with Chironomus riparius using DE-535 pyridinol is required before a full conclusion can be drawn. No information on the toxicity of the photolysis metabolite DE-535 furan is available. If an assumption of ten times higher toxicity compared to haloxyfop-R methyl ester were applied, the resulting TER value would be below the Annex VI acute trigger. Thus data to address the toxicity of this metabolite to aquatic organism is considered necessary. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. A conclusion regarding the relevance of DE-535 pyridinone can only be drawn once available studies have been evaluated. The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-R methyl ester and haloxyfop-R is considered to be low. However, the risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol needs to be addressed. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. No evaluated studies are available to conclude on the risk to non-target plants.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metribuzin,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.88r,"Metribuzin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metribuzin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 3 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants Bayer CropScience and Feinchemie Schwebda. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicants which comprises broadcast spraying to control some grasses and broad-leaved weeds in potatoes. The maximum total dose is 1.05 kg metribuzin per hectare. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were Sencor and Mistral both are water dispersible granule formulations (WG) containing 700 g/kg metribuzin. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of metribuzin in soil water and air. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Metribuzin has a moderate acute oral toxicity and low dermal and inhalation toxicity. It is neither a skin and eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser. The classification as R22 (Harmful if swallowed) has been proposed. The meeting considered that metribuzin potentially reached the requirement for classification as [R22/48] since in a number of studies, serious adverse effects were noted at doses of >50 mg/kg bw/day. The issue was flagged to ISPRA for consideration. Metribuzin did not exhibit a genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. A possible classification as R62/63 was considered and forwarded to ISPRA based on delays in skeletal ossification, considered to be related to decreased bodyweight, rather than developmental toxicity, and alterations in kidneys and ureter, together with the increased pup mortality in the multigeneration study. The ADI for metribuzin was established at 0.013 mg/kg bw/day, based on the NOAEL of 1.3 mg/kg bw/day from the chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in rats, with an assessment factor of 100. The AOEL and ARfD are 0.02 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day and on the acute neurotoxicity, respectively, with an assessment factor of 100. The operator risk assessment is inconclusive since the re-calculations provided by the rapporteur Member State lack of transparency and were not made available for peer review in due time. The metabolism of metribuzin has been investigated in potatoes, soybeans and wheat. Similar metabolic pathways were identified but different residue-amounts of parent and metabolites, depending on the crop, were observed. In potatoes about 60 % of the total residues were identified, with 20 % of the total residue being metribuzin. Three metabolites were present representing a global toxicological burden expected to be similar to that of the parent compound. Residue definitions are proposed for potatoes only. For monitoring purposes metribuzin and for risk assessment the sum of metribuzin, desamino-metribuzin, diketo-metribuzin and desaminodiketo-metribuzin, expressed as metribuzin. Residue definitions for other commodities should be dealt with at Member State level, taking into account the specific residue pattern of these commodities. Supervised residue trials according to the representative use demonstrate that residues are below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg for the parent compound and its metabolites. No residues are expected in rotational or succeeding crops. Human and animal exposure to residues of metribuzin and its metabolites is therefore minimal and below the trigger toxicological end points. Metribuzin is low to moderate persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. It forms the major metabolites diketo-metribuzin and desamino-diketo-metribuzin. Bound residues amounted up to 65.3 % AR after 71 d and CO2 up to 38.9 % AR at the end of the study after 126 d. Desamino-diketo-metribuzin is low to moderate persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. Metabolite diketo-metribuzin metabolite seems to be moderately persistent in soil under aerobic conditions (DT50 = 29.9 - 48.6 d). However, fitting procedures, kinetic employed and goodness of fitting are not reported and assessed in the DAR. Therefore, values for this metabolite should be taken with caution. Metribuzin is highly persistent in soil under anaerobic conditions. Four metabolites: desamino-metribuzin (max. 21.5 % AR), polar I (max 4.6 % AR), apolar I (max. 8.4 % AR) and apolar II (max. 5.3 % AR) reached the maximum at the end of the study of photolysis in soil (13 d). Major soil photolysis metabolite desamino-metribuzin needs to be addressed with respect of soil and ground water compartments. PEC in soil of metribuzin, diketo-metribuzin and desamino-diketo-metribuzin were calculated by the rapporteur Member State for the worst case GAP and 90th percentile half lives. Metribuzin may be classified as high to very high mobile in soil. Desamino-diketo-metribuzin is high mobile in soil. The experimentally derived K-oc for metabolite diketo-metribuzin is necessary to finalise the ground water assessment. Metribuzin is stable to hydrolysis in buffer solutions (pH 5, 6, 7 and 9) at 25 degrees C. Photolysis may strongly contribute to the dissipation of metribuzin in water with half lives shorter than one day. Main photolysis metabolite is desamino-metribuzin (max. 83.8 % AR after 6 h). Metribuzin is proposed not to be ready biodegradable for classification purposes. In water / sediment systems metribuzin was adsorbed to the sediment up to 13.6 -26 % AR and it dissipated from water phases with half lives of 31.1 to 52.6. In the whole systems it degrades with half lives of 47 - 50 d. Desamino-metribuzin was a major metabolite both in water (14.5 - 28.7 % AR) and sediment (12.1 - 22.1 %). In one study a half life of 93 d in the whole system was proposed for this metabolite. In another study, half lives were estimated as 135.4 -284.1 d in the water and 87.6 - 90.6 d in the sediment. Mineralization was very low and non extractable radioactivity increased up to 38 % AR after 100 d. The rapporteur Member State calculated PECSW for metribuzin and desaminometribuzin based on spray drift loadings only. Run off and drain flow may need to be considered for the risk assessment, since from the calculations presented by one of the applicants these routes of entry to surface water may be as relevant or more than spray drift. For PECSED, the rapporteur Member State accepted the approach presented by one of the applicants. This calculation does not cover the worst case application rate of 1050 g / ha but PECSED are actually not needed to finalize the aquatic risk assessment (driven by toxicity to Lemna and PECSW) The rapporteur Member State produced new FOCUS GW calculations for metribuzin, diketo-metribuzin and desamino-diketo-metribuzin taking into consideration all available data from both applicants. In this calculation diketo-metribuzin exceeds the trigger 0.1 mu g / L in one scenario and desamino-diketo-metribuzin in three scenarios of the nine FOCUS GW scenarios simulated. The meeting of MS experts identified a new data gap with respect to metabolite diketo-metribuzin for the necessary information (including experimentally derived Koc) to produce revised FOCUS GW assessment. Major soil photolysis metabolite desamino-metribuzin needs also to be addressed. Relevance assessment for metabolite desamino-diketo-metribuzin and diketo-metribuzin may be then necessary. One of the applicants (Bayer) submitted a lysimeter study where leaching was investigated after application of 5-C-13/C-14-metribuzin (applied at 500 g a.s / ha as WG 70 formulation). Metribuzin and diketo-metribuzin were below 0.01 mu g / L. However, desamino-diketo-metribuzin amounted for 0.14 - 0.23 mu g / L the first year and 0.09-0.14 mu g / L the second year. Two other metabolites were found in the leachate: 4-methyl-desamino-diketo-metribuzin (M17) and desmethylthio-metribuzin (U1). The meeting of MS experts identified a new data gap for the necessary information on metabolites 4-methyl-desamino-diketo-metribuzin and desmethylthio-metribuzin to undertake the FOCUS GW assessment and for the relevance assessment of metabolite desamino-diketo-metribuzin. Due to its properties, long range transport of metribuzin in the atmosphere is not expected. A first tier high acute risk was identified for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds and herbivorous mammals. The risk assessment for birds was refined by choosing the yellow hammer (Emberiza citronella) as representative of insectivorous birds and the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) as representative of herbivorous birds. Based on these refinements the risk to birds was considered to be low. It is noted by the EFSA that also the acute risk assessment was refined. For other active substances where a use in potato fields has been proposed the yellow wagtail (Montacilla flava) has often been chosen as a focal species for insectivorous birds. In the PPR Panel opinion on metamidophos(3) it was concluded that yellow wagtails nest in potato fields and that some individuals may obtain close to 100% of their food within the treated field. It is therefore proposed by the EFSA that for a full assessment of the acute risk to birds also other bird species that might be relevant are considered at Member State level. The assessment of long-term risk to mammals was refined based on estimated DT50 in green plant material and the risk was concluded to be low. Metribuzin is very toxic to green algae and aquatic plants. For the most sensitive species, Lemna gibba, risk mitigation measures comparable to buffer zones of 15 m are required to meet the Annex VI trigger of 10. The risk to bees is low. An in-field risk to other non-target arthropods was identified. However, considering that the species of concern are leaf dwellers, that residues of metribuzin can be expected to disappear within a week and that the off-field risk is low, it was concluded that there is a potential for recovery within an ecologically relevant time period. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro-organism, soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered low. Risk mitigation comparable to a 5 m buffer zone is required to protect non-target plants outside the treated field.",NA
NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benfuracarb finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.89r,"Benfuracarb is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfuracarb in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 2 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Otsuka Chemical Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 7 March 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (pre-plantation) to control soil and foliar insects, where brassica will be grown. Benfuracarb can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Oncol 8.6G"", a granule (GR), registered in France and Spain. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin and surface water. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Benfuracarb is rapidly and nearly completed absorbed reaching in the rat. The main metabolite of benfuracarb is carbofuran (approximately 30%). The acute inhalatory toxicity is high, whereas the oral toxicity moderate. The toxicity via dermal route was low. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer, proposed risk phrases are: T, R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" and R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" The critical effects are cholinesterase inhibition. Effects on reproduction parameters were observed such as, decreased male fertility, number of live pups and pup weight was decreased, even the entire second generation was lost The appropriate classification for reproduction toxicity could not be agreed and the question should be forwarded to ECB, R62 is high lighted. ECB has concluded R62 but not voted. The main metabolite of benfuracarb is the active ingredient carbofuran which is more toxic than benfuracarb. The relevant impurity 1,2 dichloroethane, is classified as toxic, Carcinogenic Category 2 (T; R45). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. The default value of 100% was agreed on for the granular formulation Oncol 8.6 G as no studies were provided. The estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED model is below (86%) the AOEL only if personal protective equipment as well as respiratory equipment is used. The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of benfuracarb was investigated in various crops with different methods of application and at different timings. Based on studies involving a foliar treatment or stem injection a metabolic pathway of benfuracarb in directly treated plants could be established. Currently, benfuracarb, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. Whether this will be fully applicable to all crops and regardless the mode of application still needs to be confirmed by further data, since the available data on soil applied uses didnt sufficiently identify potentially relevant metabolites for the supported brassica uses. Moreover a need to address residues of carbofuran in succeeding crops following application of benfuracarb was identified. Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage indicated that no residues above the respective LOQ are anticipated, however the validity of the results needs to be confirmed by further data. Moreover the residue trial database for brassicas needs to be completed. With the current knowledge and limited data available and with the provisionally agreed toxicological reference values for carbofuran it is only possible to asses consumer risk preliminary. Consumer risk has been separately assessed by the rapporteur Member State for benfuracarb residues and for carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran residues. The estimated chronic dietary intake of benfuracarb and its metabolites carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran was found to be below the ADI of benfuracarb and carbofuran, respectively. A potential acute exposure concern noted for adults and toddlers (up to 370% of carbofuran ARfD) consuming head and flowering brassicas, is primarily caused by the limited sensitivity of the analytical methods applied in the residue trials. In the acute and chronic consumer risk assessment the possible intake of carbofuran through drinking water derived from groundwater was not considered although a significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected. Benfuracarb is rapidly degraded in soil under laboratory dark aerobic conditions yielding carbofuran (maximum 84.6 % AR after 2 d) as major metabolite. This metabolite is low to moderate persistent in soil according the studies presented in the benfuracarb dossier, but may be high persistent according some studies presented by a different applicant in the carbofuran dossier. Relevance of carbofuran data for the assessment of benfuracarb may need further consideration. Other minor metabolites were detected (maximum sum of them: 34.9 % AR after 0.24 d) that individually did not reached the 10 % AR. Mineralization was high at the end of the study (CO2 = 27.7 % AR - 66.6 % AR). Amount of unextractable residues reached a maximum = 74.1 % at the end of the study in one of the soils. Experts meeting agreed that 3-ketocarbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran (minor carbofuran metabolites containing the carbamate moiety) need to be addressed, as potential benfuracarb soil metabolites, for ground water contamination. The applicant was required to address the degradation of benfuracarb in alkaline soils. A position paper and a new study are available but are still neither evaluated nor peer reviewed. No soil photolysis study has been provided for benfuracarb. Carbofuran is photolytically stable on soil surface, according the data available in carbofuran dossier. Degradation of carbofuran seems to be very dependent of the temperature. The rapporteur Member State informed that the applicant had submitted a position paper and a new study to address the degradation of carbofuran at low temperatures but these reports have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Worst case laboratory half lives were used to calculate PEC soil of benfuracarb. Data from a different applicant in carbosulfan dossier show that field worst case half life for carbofuran is 71.9 d in EU sites. Therefore, carbofuran PECs soil were calculated by the rapporteur Member State with this half life. According the conclusion for carbofuran, reliability of this value needs to be further assessed and confirmed. It was estimated, by the HPLC method, that benfuracarb may be classified as immobile in soil (K-oc = 9100 mL / g). Carbofuran may be classified as very high mobile compound (K-oc = 17 - 28 mL / g). No data is available with respect the adsorption desorption properties of minor relevant soil metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran and 3-keto-carbofuran. A lysimeter study is available where two different lysimeters are investigated. Benfuracarb was found at maximum amounts of 0.25 mu g / L and carbofuran at maximum amounts of 0.16 mu g / L. A new lysimeter study was required by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the new FOCUS GW modelling required can substitute the requirement for a new lysimeter at this stage. Hydrolysis of benfuracarb is pH dependent with half lives between less than half hour (pH 4) and 26.9 d (pH 9). In the natural water experiment (pH approximate to 7-8) photolysis seems not to contribute significantly to the aqueous degradation of benfuracarb. However, irradiation seems to enhance the degradation of the metabolite carbofuran to carbofuran-7-phenol. Benfuracarb is not readily biodegradable. A study with two water sediment systems is available. Both systems are in the alkaline range (pH (water) 7.8-8.4). Main compounds found in the water phase are benfuracarb and carbofuran (maximum = 58.26 % AR after 2d). Main compounds found in the sediment phase are carbofuran (maximum = 25.31 % after 14 d) and carbofuran-7-phenol (maximum = 13.6 %). The cumulative amounts of CO2 at the end of the study accounted for 13.6 % AR and 16.7 % AR. Most of the radioactivity was present as bounded residue to the sediment by the end of the study (73.8 % AR = 75.9 % AR). Benfuracarb dissipates rapidly in water phase with a half life between 6 h to 15 h. Main dissipation process is transformation to carbofuran. Carbofuran dissipates from water phase with half life between 8.2 d to 27.2 d. Main dissipation process is partitioning into sediment. Whole system and sediment phase half lives had not been calculated. A report with the estimation of the whole system half life is available but not evaluated and peer reviewed. Also the half life in the sediment for carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol needs to be assessed. In the carbofuran dossier, dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 41 d. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 5.3-6.9 d and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 7.8 - 11.6 d. These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems. PECSW of carbofuran has been calculated for a limited number of FOCUS sw scenarios. Calculation of PECSW, for parent benfuracarb and PECSED for benfuracarb, carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol, need to be performed. Updated FOCUS PECSW / (SED) are available but have still not been evaluated and peer reviewed. PEC gw have been calculated for benfuracarb and carbofuran. Annual average 80th percentiles of benfuracarb were < 0.001 mu g / L for all calculated scenarios (7 cabbage spring, 5 cabbage summer). Carbofuran exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger in 4 of the 7 spring scenarios and in three of the five summer scenarios. In one of the summer scenarios (Hamburg) an 80th percentile annual average of 1.212 mu g / L was reached. The applicant was required to address the potential for ground water contamination by the metabolite 3-keto carbofuran. New calculations to address potential groundwater contamination by metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, carbofuran-7-phenol and 3-keto-carbofuran are available but neither evaluated nor peer reviewed. However, it is noted that these calculations do not take into consideration the longer half lives observed for carbofuran from the data of the second carbofuran applicant. Concentrations of benfuracarb in the air compartment are expected to be negligible, due to short persistence in the atmosphere. An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided the 18th of May 2006. The information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Substantial data requirements to address the risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules, ingestion of treated seedlings and contaminated earthworms were identified by the rapporteur Member State. Further studies were submitted by the applicant. The aquatic risk assessment based on PECsw from drainage resulted in a high acute and chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates in 2 out of 3 scenarios. Based on the peer-reviewed data a high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded. However the new data need to be evaluated before drawing a final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to bees from exposure to residues in cabbage was assessed as low since cabbage has no flower in the production crop. The potential risk to bees from residues in flowering weeds should be assessed at Member State level taking into account the agricultural practice (management of weeds in cabbage fields). Data requirements were identified in the DAR to address the risk to ground dwelling arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and other non-target organisms. New data/information was submitted by the applicant. An addendum to the chapter on ecotoxicology has been provided on the 18th of May 2006.

NA,Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substancecarbosulfan finalised: 28 July 2006,2006,EFSA JOURNAL,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2006.91r,"Carbosulfan is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbosulfan in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects, where maize and sugar beet will be grew. The application rate is 0.75 kg carbosulfan per hectare. Carbosulfan can be used as insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Marshal 10G"", a granule (GR), registered in some Member States of the EU. It should be noted that the applicant no longer supports the second formulation, presented in the dossier and DAR (""Marshal 25CS""). Consequently the uses on citrus and cotton are no longer supported. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, soil and water. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Carbosulfan is toxic if swallowed and should be classified as T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". It is of low toxicity via dermal route and toxic via inhalation (classification as T, R23 is proposed). Carbosulfan is not a skin or eye irritant but is a skin sensitiser and should be classified R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Carbosulfan gave negative results in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and did not show any carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, the level of impurities in batches used for toxicological studies remains a concern. In the three-generation rat study, the relevant maternal and reproductive NOAEL was 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw/d. Carbosulfan displayed no potential for induced delayed neurotoxicity. The provisional reference values are as follows: ADI and ARfD are 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; AOEL is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. The risk assessment for operators has to be considered as inconclusive until the AOEL is confirmed. However, it can be assumed that bystander and worker exposure is likely to be negligible under the supported conditions of use. The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbosulfan was investigated in various crops with different methods of application. Based on these studies the metabolic pathway of carbosulfan in plants can be considered as sufficiently investigated. At the time being, carbosulfan, carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, the metabolite dibutylamine is still under discussion concerning its possible genotoxicity and ought to be therefore considered a potential candidate to include in the residue definition, too. Moreover a need to address residues of dibutylamine but also carbofuran and its metabolites in succeeding crops following application of carbosulfan was identified. Based on the currently proposed residue definition, supervised residue trials in sugar beet and maize indicated that residues were low and mostly below the respective LOQ. However, the available residue trials have to be reconsidered for their validity and sufficiency. With regard to the metabolite dibuytlamine no residue data have been reported. Further residue data in cotton seed and citrus will be needed if foliar uses are reinstated in the future. Since the assessment of plant residues still needs to be finalized and due to the lack of peer reviewed evaluation of relevant data and information it is not possible to conclude on whether or not significant residues may occur in edible animal matrices. The consumer risk assessment should be considered as inconclusive due to the uncertainties caused by lacking data identified during the evaluation. In soil under laboratory aerobic conditions, carbosulfan yields carbofuran (max. 48.7 % - 69.3 % AR after 7 d). Also 3-keto-carbofuran is produced in significant amounts (max. 5.3 % - 6.6 %) and needs to be further assessed as it contains the active carbamate moiety. The mineralization was very limited and bounded residues increased up to maximum of 90 % AR after 100 d. In a study performed with 14C-dibutylamine labelled carbosulfan, dibutylamine was found as a major aerobic soil metabolite. No valid degradation study of carbosulfan in soil under anaerobic conditions is available. Also photolysis in soil was not investigated. Metabolite carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil in its DAR. Evaluation meeting agreed that a re-evaluation of the degradation kinetic in degradation studies had to be performed. Reassessment is available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Therefore, end points for laboratory soil degradation of carbosulfan have not been established. Summaries of some field dissipation studies in EU are available. Half life of carbosulfan in these trials ranges between 0.35 to 31.3 d and half life of carbofuran is between 1.3 to 71.9 d. EFSA notes that, in the context of the carbofuran discussion, the meeting of MS experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper is available (June 2005) but has still not been assessed and peer reviewed. PEC in soil were calculated in the DAR for carbosulfan and carbofuran based on the field worst case half lives and the representative uses in maize, sugar beet, citrus and cotton. Evaluation meeting agreed that half life and PEC soil of dibutylamine need to be determined. A position paper is already available but has not been evaluated and peer reviewed. The rapporteur Member State concluded that the soil adsorption / desorption study is of limited quality. The meeting of MS experts agreed that the study was not valid and identified a data gap for a valid study for carbosulfan and dibutylamine. For the metabolite carbofuran an additional study (from a different notifier Dianica) is available in its dossier as active substance. A lysimeter study is available. However, annual average concentrations and detailed characterization of the residue are missing. Evaluation meeting agreed that levels of dibutylamine need to be determined in the leachate samples and that the two new lysimeters performed with carbofuran should be submitted and assessed. These studies and a position paper are already available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Carbosulfan hydrolyses with half lives lower than 1 d at pH 5 and 7 and of 7 d at pH 9. Main products are carbofuran and dibutylamine. Carbofuran degrades to carbofuran-7-phenol. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of carbosulfan in water. Two regions of polar degradation products (66.7 % AR) were found but not characterized. Their environmental relevance is uncertain and was not examined by the meeting of MS experts since the study was still not evaluated. Carbosulfan is not readily biodegradable. Carbosulfan was low persistent in aerobic water / sediment systems. Main metabolites formed were carbofuran (max. 34.7 % AR in water; max. 20.1 % AR in sediment) and carbofuran-7-phenol (max. 11.6 % AR in water; max. 3.21 % AR in sediment). A non characterized metabolite (Unknown 3) appears at levels above 10 % AR in the sediment of some systems (max. 20.11 % AR after 7 d). This compound has been tentatively identified as a structure that contains the carbamate moiety and may be expected to produce carbofuran when degraded. The amount of bound residues increased steadily up to 30.5 - 43.0 % AR at the end of the experiments (102 d). No half lives are reported in carbosulfan DAR for metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol in the water / sediment systems. From water / sediment studies summarized in the carbofuran DAR, carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a first order half life of approximately 41 d. Available water sediment studies under alkaline conditions (from carbofuran applicant Dianica) show a faster degradation of carbofuran and the formation of carbofuran-7-phenol at high levels. PECSW/SED were calculated by the applicant based on an ad hoc modelling exercise. Evaluation Meeting confirmed the rapporteur Member State data requirement for FOCUS SW PECSW/SED and agreed that PECSW for dibutylamine need to be calculated. FOCUS SW calculations and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. The applicant presented an estimation of the potential for ground water contamination based on the FOCUS GW scheme (PRZM). The rapporteur Member State considered that half life and Koc employed for carbofuran in the calculation were not justified and proposed a data requirement for new PECGW. This data requirement was confirmed by the Evaluation Meeting that additionally required calculation of PECGW for metabolite dibutylamine. New FOCUS GW calculations for carbofuran and a position paper for dibutylamine are available but have not been evaluated and peer reviewed. Additionally, experts meeting indicated that potential ground water contamination by soil metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran should be addressed. It is not expected that neither carbosulfan nor its transformation product carbofuran (from data in carbofuran dossier) may contaminate the air compartment or be prone to long range transport through air. An addendum to the fate and behaviour chapter has been provided on 18 May 2006. When reported, the information in the addendum has been summarized too briefly to draw any conclusion on its reliability. Studies or reports presumably submitted by the applicant are not adequately referenced. Therefore studies submitted by the applicant after the DAR was submitted are considered neither evaluated nor peer-reviewed in this conclusion. The first tier risk assessment based on generic species identified a potential risk to insectivorous birds in citrus and cotton, to medium herbivorous birds in cotton and to small herbivorous mammals in citrus from foliar application of carbosulfan. Only a small number of granules have to be ingested by a small bird to reach the acute LD50 or the LC50, hence the risk of ingestion of granules should be further addressed. The number of granules that have to be ingested by a small mammal to reach the LD50 is relatively high and since granules are not attractive to mammals the acute risk is considered to be low. Few granules are however needed to reach the NOAEL for mammals and the long-term risk needs to be further addressed. Also the risk from ingestion of treated seedlings, contaminated earthworms, fish and drinking water needs to be evaluated. Carbosulfan and the metabolite carbofuran are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. For citrus and cotton the risk assessment indicates acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms even with 50 m buffer zones based on contamination by spray drift only. Based on available data for PECsw, a long-term risk is indicated for all representative uses evaluated from exposure to the metabolite carbofuran via drainage to surface water. The assessment needs to be refined based on FOCUS modelling of PECsw. Carbosulfan is toxic to bees. For the representative uses in citrus and cotton the risk needs to be further addressed by semi-field or field tests. Since sugar beet crop is not flowering the risk from the use in sugar beet is considered low. The risk to bees from exposure to carbosulfan/carbofuran in nectar and pollen following granular application was not assessed due to non evaluated data on oral toxicity for carbofuran. Laboratory studies confirm that carbosulfan is toxic to arthropods. Further semi-field or field studies are required to evaluate the risk. The risk to earthworms from the use of MARCHAL 25 CS is considered as low. For the granular formulation further clarification is needed on whether the field study with MARCHAL 25 CS can be used for the assessment. No evaluation of the risk to soil micro-organisms and non-target plants is available. For biological methods of sewage treatment the risk is considered to be low.",NA

RovabioTM PHY AP/LC is a feed additive with 3-phytase as its declared activity. It is produced by fermentation of the fungus Penicillium funiculosum 4.05b, which is genetically modified by introducing two genes, i.e. the gene encoding 3-phytase from P. funiculosum MW 163 and the selectable marker gene tubl* from P. funiculosum IM1134756 that confers resistance to the fungicide benomyl. Multiple copies of the genes are randomly integrated into the fungal genome. No antibiotic resistance marker sequences are present in the final producer strain. The final enzyme preparation contains no cultivable producer organism and the level of newly introduced DNA is below the detection limit. Rovabio (TM) PHY LC/AP is intended to be used in chickens for fattening, laying hens, weaned piglets, and pigs for fattening. The minimum proposed dose for incorporation in feeds is 300 RPU (for laying hens) and 350 RPU (for chickens and pigs for fattening and weaned piglets) for both forms. The maximum recommended dose for all species/categories is 500 RPU kg(-1). There is a significant loss of phytase activity after incorporation of RovabioTM PHY in premixtures or feeds at temperatures above 20 degrees C. There is a concern that this low stability could lead to a significant under-dosing of the animals, despite the warnings included in the proposed product label. Although most of the studies for efficacy and tolerance have been performed with the liquid formulation, these are considered to apply to both forms of the product. Evidence of efficacy of Rovabio (TM) PHY has been provided at a minimum dose of 300 RPU kg(-l) for laying hens, 350 RPU kg(-1) feed for chickens for fattening and pigs for fattening and 250 RPU kg(-1) feed for piglets. Rovabio (TM) PHY is tolerated at seven times (chickens for fattening, laying hens), eight times (piglets) and five times (pigs for fattening) the maximum recommended dose. Safety for pigs for fattening is further reassured by the safety demonstrated at eight times the maximum recommended dose in piglets. Therefore, it is concluded that Rovabio (TM) PHY is safe for the target species when used at the recommended dose range. Phytase as present in Rovabio (TM) PHY LC/AP is not mutagenic and did not show a toxic response of consumer relevance in a sub-chronic toxicity study. It was demonstrated to be slightly irritant for the eye and a potential sensitizer. The active substance is a 3-phytase which can be considered essentially similar to naturally occurring phytases, and therefore no risk for the environment is foreseen. Therefore, RovabioTM PHY LC/AP is considered safe for the target species, the consumer, the user and the environment, when used under the conditions of use proposed by the applicant.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance spiromesifen,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.105r,"Spiromesifen is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 United Kingdom received an application from Bayer CropScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/105/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on spiromesifen, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 20 February 2004. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 16 April 2004. The peer review was initiated on 16 April 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in November 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the applicant that comprises broadcast spraying to cucumber, courgette, pepper, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), French bean, melon, strawberry and ornamentals in permanent greenhouse only. Full details of the representative uses evaluated can be found in the attached list of endpoints. It should be note that this active also has acaricidal properties but only its use as an insecticide have been considered in the DAR and in this conclusion. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Oberon SC 240 (BSN 2060 SC 240"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Insufficient methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues of spiromesifen in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated) however, no method is currently available for spiromesifen-enol which forms part of the residue definition in plants. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of spiromesifen and spiromesifen-enol in soil and water and spiromesifen in air. However, it should be noted that the LOQ for air is not sufficient. Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is no method available for the relevant impurity in the plant protection product. Spiromesifen has a low acute oral, dermal and inhalational toxicity in rats. It is not a skin or eye irritant. It is a skin sensitiser (the risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed). Histological findings in adrenals due to decreased plasma cholesterol levels were seen in short-term and long-term studies in rodents, together with induction of microsomal hepatic enzymes, also present in dogs. Spiromesifen did not show any genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant repeat dose NOAEL is 3 mg/kg bw/day. Spiromesifen was tested in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies showing effects only as a consequence of maternal toxicity (reduced oestrus cycling frequency, increased number of ovarian primordial follicles, slightly delayed maturation of external sexual organs in weanlings and slightly more advanced ossification of phalangeal and skull bones). The parental and offspring NOAEL is 30 ppm (about 3.3 mg/kg bw/day), while the reproductive NOAEL is 120 ppm (equal to 14.2 mg/kg bw/day). The maternal and developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. Spiromesifen did not raise any concern for neurotoxic effects. The Acceptable Daily Intake was established to be 0.03 mg/kg bw/day, based on the relevant long term toxicity NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/day (short term and long term toxicity in mouse) applying a safety factor of 100; an Acute Reference Dose of 2 mg/kg bw is proposed based on applying a 100fold uncertainty factor to the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg bw/day from an acute neurotoxicity study in rats. An Acceptable Operator Exposure Level of 0.015 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/day, using an assessment factor of 100 and correction for incomplete oral absorption (50%). Levels of systemic exposure for operators applying spiromesifen are estimated to be below the AOEL for operators wearing protective gloves when mixing and loading and a protective coverall and protective gloves during application. The estimated worker exposure is 45% and 25% of the AOEL for vegetables and ornamentals, respectively. Bystanders are unlikely to be exposed to spiromesifen for applications in greenhouses. Metabolism of spiromesifen was investigated in tomato, lettuce and cotton. The picture of metabolism was similar across the tested crops. A significant reaction in spiromesifen metabolism is the cleavage of the ester bond forming spiromesifen- enol (M013). The available data on rotational crop metabolism show a similar profile of metabolism compared to the primary crop. However, the metabolite M024 and its conjugates are present in higher proportions in the rotational crop compared to the primary crops and are the most abundant residues in rotated crops. Currently only rotation of soil grown fruiting vegetables with fruiting vegetables has been assessed, and therefore further data are necessary to address the potential for uptake of residues in other crops that are realistically expected to occur in crop rotations, depending on individual MS practices. A sufficient number of valid residues trials are available to support the consumer risk assessment and MRL proposals for all notified representative uses except for the use in peppers, as these trials were not conducted at the appropriate application rate. Investigation of metabolism and residue levels in livestock and food of animal origin respectively is currently not required as none of the crops concerned by the notified representative uses in greenhouses (primary as well as rotational crops) are usually fed to livestock. The consumer exposure through residues from crops treated with spiromesifen according to the notified GAP is expected to be well below the toxicological reference values for spiromesifen (ADI, ARfD) for the considered consumer groups adults, children and toddlers. Assessment on fate and behaviour in the environment was based on representative uses for glasshouse, assuming a permanent glasshouse that stays after the harvest at least until residues of parent and metabolites in soil are below the LOQ. Spiromesifen is low to moderately persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 C. It is hydrolysed to form the major soil metabolite M01 (max 85 % AR after 14 d) that oxidises to major metabolite M095 (max 14.1 % AR after 90 d). Both metabolites were shown to be of low to high persistence in soil. Photolysis does not seem to contribute to the environmental degradation of spiromesifen in soil but may accelerate the degradation of its metabolite M01. PEC soil were calculated based on worst case laboratory half lives and maximum formation of metabolites M01 and M09. The HPLC method following draft OCDE guideline 121 was used to estimate the Koc value for spiromesifen. According to this test spiromesifen should be classified as immobile in soil. RMS proposed that, were the applicant to consider outdoor uses, a standard adsorption / desorption study at neutral conditions should be provided. According to the equilibrium batch adsorption/desorption studies, metabolites M01 and M09 were very high mobile in soil. Hydrolysis of spiromesifen is pH dependent being faster at alkaline pH and produces the major metabolite M01 that does not hydrolyse further. Photolytic half life of spiromesifen in water was 1.7 d in the laboratory conditions. Two major aqueous photolysis metabolites were identified. The experts' meeting agreed that in the case of spiromesifen adsorption to sediment seems to be the dominant route of dissipation from the water phase. Therefore, no further data were required on these metabolites. M01 was found to be stable to photolysis in water. The experts' meeting agreed to propose that spiromesifen is classified as not readily biodegradable. No risk assessment was conducted for earthworms, other soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms because exposure was considered as negligible for uses in glasshouses which are permanent structures. The ecotoxicological risk assessment was conducted for the use in a permanent glasshouse where exposure of wildlife is considered negligible. Member states where non-permanent structures are used should take this into consideration.In the two dark aerobic water/sediment experiments with alkaline water phase, spiromesifen degraded in the whole systems with half lives of 4.1 d and 7.8 d. The only major metabolite identified in both water and sediment was M01 (max. water 89.7 % AR after 63 d; max. sed. 38 % after 90 d) that is relatively stable in the whole system. Mineralization was practically negligible and unextractable residue in the sediment amounted to 3 - 16 % AR after 120 d. PECSW were calculated using the Dutch assumption of 0.1 % loss of the active substance for the parent and metabolite M01. In the case of metabolite M01, it was assumed that no degradation occurred between applications. Worst case PECSED were calculated based on the same model assuming in this case no degradation between applications neither for the parent nor for the metabolite M01. Potential ground water contamination by spiromesifen and soil metabolites M01 and M09 were produced by the applicant with FOCUS-PELMO and modified scenarios to represent glasshouse conditions. In this exercise, the trigger of 0.1 ae g /L was not exceeded for any of the substances of concern. Spiromesifen is not considered prone to cause contamination through atmospheric long range transport. Spiromesifen is of low acute, short-term and chronic toxicity to birds and mammals. Direct exposure via contaminated food items is considered negligible. A risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals based on the PECsw calculated by the Dutch model and the reproductive NOECs indicated a low risk from secondary poisoning. Spiromesifen is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The risk to fish, algae and sediment dwelling insects was assessed as low based on the Dutch exposure model. However the long-term TER for daphnids was below the trigger of 10. The expert meeting concluded that the risk to aquatic invertebrates is not addressed on the basis of the Dutch exposure model and further risk refinement is required. The risk of the major metabolite in the water phase M01 and the soil metabolite M09 to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. Adverse effects on bumblebees were observed at an exposure of 0.72 mg/bee/week. Exposure of naturally occurring bee and bumblebee species is considered to be low because of negligible exposure. If bumblebees are used as pollinators in glasshouse the observed effects should be considered further. High mortality (> 30%) of non-target arthropods was observed at application rates much lower than the recommended rate of 216 g spiromesifen/ha. Exposure of naturally occurring populations of nontarget arthropods is considered to be low and hence the risk is expected to be low. If biological control is used in glasshouse then the observed effects on Coccinella septempunctata and Typhlodromus pyri need to be considered further. The risk to non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. No risk assessment was conducted for earthworms, other soil non-target macro-and micro-organisms because exposure was considered as negligible for uses in glasshouses which are permanent structures. The ecotoxicological risk assessment was conducted for the use in a permanent glasshouse where exposure of wildlife is considered negligible. Member states where non-permanent structures are used should take this into consideration.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.103r,"Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251 is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 Belgium received an application from Prophyta for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/305/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State Belgium made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on P. lilacinus strain 251, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 8 December 2004. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 9 November 2004. The peer review was initiated on 9 November 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses on potato, tomato, tobacco, lettuce, celery, cucurbits, carrots, grapes and ornamentals for the control of nematodes. The formulation is usually applied as a soil drench but can also be used as a dip for young plants. Full details of the application rate and timings can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was BioAct WG a wettable granule formulation (WG). As the available data indicate the organism is not competitive in the environment unless the host species are present, it is not pathogenic to humans, toxic or infective and does not produce any known toxicologically significant secondary metabolites, methods of analysis for monitoring are not required. However, it should be noted that some methods for soil and water are given in the DAR. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In acute toxicity studies, P. lilacinus strain 251 did not induce signs of toxicity, pathogenicity and infectivity. Literature shows that fungal infection by P. lilacinus occurs rarely, mainly in immunodepressed subjects. Several investigators have described P. lilacinus endophthalmitis, in some cases with severe morbidity. Dermatologic infections constitute a large group of published reports. An epidemic with P. lilacinus was described with direct inoculation of the microorganism onto the skin with secondary haematogenous spread in one case. Infection manifested as cutaneous lesions without evidence of dissemination. Skin lesions erupted insidiously without fever and varied greatly. Additional accounts of P. lilacinus infection include reports of chronic maxillary sinusitis and a report of pulmonary mycosis. There is no evidence for any infection, toxicity and pathogenicity of this strain in manufacturing workers. The formulation Bioact was found positive in a Buhler assay. The classification as Xn, R43 (""May cause sensitisation by skin contact) was proposed, together with classification as R42 (""May cause sensitisation by inhalation""). P. lilacinus extract of strain 251 does not have any clastogenic effect under experimental conditions. No ADI is proposed ( the strain 251 has been shown not to produce any paecylotoxin and the formulated product contains purified spores). The AOEL is not deemed necessary since the microrganisms is not pathogenic or infective and does not produce toxins. No exposure assessment is therefore needed. P. lilacinus strain 251 does not colonise the root surface and thus the micro-organism is considered not likely to grow and multiply on plant material. Dietary exposure from use P. lilacinus strain 251 is likely to be minimal. Moreover, any potentially occurring residual deposits on the treated crops are not relevant as a human health concern due to the toxicological profile of this strain. The available data indicated that the only component that required an environmental exposure and risk assessment was colony forming units of P. lilacinus Strain 251. Data on competitiveness and persistence of added P. lilacinus Strain 251 to soil and natural surface water, indicated that the organism was not very competitive and that following addition of P. lilacinus Strain 251 to the soil environment or spray drift exposure to surface water levels would be expected to decline. As a consequence of the method of application (incorporation in the soil or watering in or transplant drench) the organism would not be expected to move significantly out of the target treated area (upper soil layers). Consequently groundwater exposure to P. lilacinus Strain 251 would not be expected. P. lilacinus strain 251 does not grow above 33 degrees C and it does not produce toxic metabolites. In the DAR it was explained that the product PBP-01001-I is applied as a pre-planting soil treatment followed by incorporation in soil and/or transplant drench. These use patterns suggest low likelihood of direct exposure and a low risk to birds and mammals. However the GAP table lists also uses with treatments all over the growing season and all sprayer types. For this uses direct exposure via contaminated food items is likely to occur. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals from direct exposure and some uncertainty remains on the risk to bird and mammals for uses where direct exposure occurs. A study on the persistence and survival of conidia in pond water showed that the potential of proliferation of P. lilacinus in surface water is low. Toxicity studies showed that the formulated product has no adverse effects up to the highest tested dose of 100 mg/L. Effects on algal growth were observed in the high test concentrations. The cause of the effects was not clear but if the endpoint from the study is compared to maximum PECsw the resulting TER of >10 indicates a low risk to algae. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms is low. Tests with non-target arthropods showed that the leaf dwelling species Aphidius rhopalosiphi reacted more sensitive than the other species tested (e.g. Typhlodromus pyri and the soil dwelling species Poecilus cupreus) indicating a potential high risk to leaf dwelling arthropods. The risk to non-target arthropods was discussed in the PRAPeR experts' meeting. It was concluded that the risk needs to be addressed further for uses where exposure of leaf dwelling arthropods is likely. For these uses risk mitigation measures should be applied like irrigating the plants, placing the sprayer nozzles close to the ground and using nozzles producing big droplets. Tests with beneficial nematodes gave some indication that non-target species related to the group of the target organisms would not be efficiently parasitized by P. lilacinus. However the reliability of test results is uncertain since no positive control or a susceptible nematode species were included in the tests. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants was considered as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.111r,"Prothioconazole is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC' United Kingdom received an application from Bayer CropScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/35/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on prothioconazole, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 18 October 2004. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 21 October 2004. The peer review was initiated on 21 October 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure in January 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar application to wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oats and oilseed rape and as a seed treatment to the same crops excluding oilseed rape. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. There are two representative formulated products evaluated Proline an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation and Redigo a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) formulation. Methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for food of plant origin, water, soil and air. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi method (The German S19 method has been validated for prothioconazole-desthio). Only single methods are available to determine residues of prothioconazole-desthio, in products of animal origin and prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio in soil water and air. A method is not available to monitor the glucuronide conjugate in products of animal origin. Also if the active is classified as toxic then methods for body fluids and tissues would need to be considered. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methods for the relevant impurities in the formulation are not available. Prothioconazole is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity; it does not show any eye and skin irritation or sensitising potential. The relevant short term oral NOAEL is 25 mg/kg bw/day and the chronic NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day (the liver being the main target organ with increases in hepatic enzyme activity, increased liver weights and hepatocellular hypertrophy were consistent with hepatic enzyme induction). Prothioconazole does not show in vivo genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant reproductive NOAEL is 95.6 mg/kg bw/day, while the developmental NOAEL is 20 mg/kg bw/day. In rats, an increased incidence of microphthalmia was observed at the high dose level. The increased incidence of rudimentary supernumerary ribs at the high dose level was also considered to be treatment related. Hence, prothioconazole was proposed to be classified as Repro cat 3, R 63 (Repro cat 2?), based on the increased incidences of microphthalmia (at 1000 mg/kg, maternal toxic dose) in one out of two rat strains tested. Prothioconazole did not show toxicity to the nervous system. The proposed ADI for prothioconazole is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, and the ARM and AOEL are 0.2 mg/kg bw. The estimated operator exposure to the 250 EC formulation is below the AOEL when PPE is worn for mechanical spraying in cereals, using the UK-POEM and the German model. The exposure of operators working at the treatment of seeds with the prothioconazole FS formulation accounts for about 45% of the AOEL for operators performing mixing/loading/calibration/cleaning and bagging. For sowing, the estimated exposure is about 2% of the AOEL. The exposure of workers after spraying in cereals is about 45% of the AOEL. Estimated exposure of bystanders is negligible The main metabolite prothioconazole-desthio, M04, is considered relevant. An ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/day (liver histopathology and reduced weight gain in the rat carcinogenicity study), applying a 100 fold assessment factor. The ARM was discussed in the experts' meeting: the experts agreed on the NOAEL from the rat developmental study (1 mg/kg bw/day), based on an increase in supernumerary ribs at 3 mg/kg bw/day, with a SF 100. The same value of 0.01 mg/kg bw was considered as an AOEL. M04 was toxic for the development in rats and rabbits and the classification Repro.cat.2, R61 was proposed by the experts. The metabolism of prothioconazole has been fully investigated in cereals, oilseeds, rotational crops as well as in livestock and mainly proceeds through oxidative reactions. In most plant parts and animal tissues, the major compound of the metabolic pattern is prothioconazole-desthio, which is more toxic than the parent compound. Given the complex plant and animal metabolic pattern and to reflect adequately the toxicological burden the consumer is exposed to, the residue definition for risk assessment in all commodities is the sum of prothioconazole-desthio and all metabolites containing the 2-(1-chlorocyclopropy1)-3-(2-chloropheny1)-2-hydroxypropyl-2H-1,2,4-triazole moiety, expressed as prothioconazole-desthio. This residue definition for risk assessment is however provisional as beside the metabolites which are structurally related to the parent compound, cereal grains, oilseeds, rotational crops and animal products are expected to contain significant amounts of non specific triazole derivative metabolites. These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007. The monitoring of plant and animal commodities can be targeted on prothioconazole-desthio, but in animal tissue, its glucuronide conjugate needs to be included in the analysis. A sufficient amount of data has been submitted in order to set MRLs. Chronic and acute consumer exposures are well below the respective toxicological trigger values allocated to prothioconazole-desthio. This assessment was conducted on the basis of the provisional residue definition for risk assessment and does not cover the triazole derivative metabolites. A robust conclusion on the risk for the consumer cannot be finalised at this stage. Information on the actual level of those derivatives in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is lacking. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class whose degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring. The available studies on the environmental fate and behaviour of prothioconazole indicated that there is no potential for persistence or accumulation of prothioconazole and its degradation products in the environmental compartments. Prothioconazole is of low persistence in soil in both laboratory and field studies (lab DT50 = 0.07-1.27 days; field DT50 = 1.3-2.8 days, median = 1.6 day). The major metabolites formed in soil, i.e. prothioconazole-desthio (M04, max. 49.4% AR) and prothioconazoleS-methyl (M01, max. 14.6% AR), are more persistent (in laboratory studies DT50 for MO1 = 5.9-46.0 days, and DT50 for M04 = 7.0-34.0 days). Under field conditions, the dissipation time for prothioconazole-desthio was estimated to be in the range of 16.3-72.3 days. In all field trials no residues of prothioconazole or of its metabolites were detected below 20 cm depth of soils. These findings confirmed the results obtained from different laboratory mobility studies, which showed that prothioconazole is of low mobility (K0. = 1765 mLig, determined in aged column leaching study), as well as prothioconazole-S-methyl and prothioconazole-desthio (Kf0. = 1974 - 2995 mL/g and 523 625 mLig, respectively). Exposure assessment with FOCUS-PELMO model indicated that no concerns related to groundwater contamination by prothioconazole or its metabolite prothioconazoledesthio (M04) and prothioconazole-S-methyl (M01) are to be expected. From soil photolysis studies, there appeared to be no significant influence of light on the rate of degradation of prothioconazole. Prothioconazole is considered stable to hydrolysis and hydrolytic breakdown will not contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole in the aquatic environment. Whenever surface water will be contaminated by the parent compound, solar radiation may contribute to the degradation of prothioconazole via phototransformation reactions (predicted environmental half-life under June solar summer conditions of 11 days in Athens, Greece). Prothioconazole-desthio (M04) was identified as the main photolytic degradation product (max. 56% AR). Other two major degradation products were identified as prothioconazole-thiazocine (M12) at 14% AR and 1,2,4-triazole (M13) at 12% AR. Taking into account the fast dissipation of prothioconazole from the water phase (DT5owater = 0.8-1.0 days at 20 degrees C in the dark) observed in a water/sediment study, it is unlikely that prothioconazolethiazocine (M12) will be formed at >10% in natural surface water systems under realistic environmental conditions. 1,2,4-triazole (M13) shows no light adsorption above 290 nm and is regarded as stable to photolytic degradation in water. Prothioconazole rapidly disappeared from two aerobic natural water/sediment systems, with a calculated half-life of 1.6-2.8 days referring to the whole system. A proportion of prothioconazole partitioned quite rapidly into the sediment (max 22.623.4% AR in the sediment on day 1), but there is also rapid degradation to prothioconazole-desthio (M04), which can also partition into sediment (max 26.9% AR). Another metabolite exceeding 10% of the applied radioactivity in the water layer was identified as L2,4-triazole (M13, max. 37.2% AR). No DT50 values for metabolites were available. Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsw) and sediment (PECsed) were estimated for prothioconazole, prothioconazole-desthio (M04) and 1,2,4-triazole (no PECsed calculations provided as not being a major metabolite in sediment) assuming spray drift from the maximum three recommended foliar applications. Based on the results concerning vapour pressure, Henry Law constant and photo oxidative stability in ambient air, it can be concluded that neither emission of prothioconazole into the air, nor accumulation and contamination by wet or dry deposition are to be expected for the parent compound and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio (M04). The risk to birds and mammals from the use of prothioconazole as a foliar application in cereals and oilseed rape is considered to be low. The assessment of long-term risk for birds and mammals from the use as cereal seed treatment indicates a high risk based on the available and peer reviewed data and information. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input comparable to 5 m spray free buffer zones are required to protect the aquatic environment based on the currently evaluated data and information. EFSA recommends that the available full life cycle study with the metabolite prothioconazole-desthio is evaluated before a final conclusion on the risk to fish is drawn. Furthermore, bioconcentration of prothioconazole-S-methyl should be considered at Member State level should MS surface water exposure assessment show that this metabolite may contaminate surface water from drainage and/or run-off. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non -target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clomazone,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.109r,"Clomazone is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clomazone in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 16 March 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 11 July 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in June July 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 June 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on oilseed rape, for full details of the GAP please see the attached endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Centium 36 CS"", a capsule suspension (CS). Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For air there is a single method available that analysed for clomazone. Soil and water methods were provided however, they appear to contain a hydrolysis step and will therefore not be specific to clomazone. Several methods were provided for soil and water metabolites however, no conclusion was made on the acceptability of the validation data during the peer review process. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Clomazone has a moderate acute toxicity by inhalation and if swallowed, it is not irritating to skin and eyes, and is not a skin sensitiser. In repeat dose studies, the liver was the target organ for all the species. The compound is not genotoxic, not carcinogenic, and has no reproductive or developmental effect. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level are both 0.133 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, and the acute reference dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The 100% default value for the dermal absorption was used, resulting in operator exposure estimates below the AOEL when gloves are used during mixing/loading and application. Metabolism studies with pre-emergence treatment were conducted in tobacco, sweet potatoes and soy bean. In addition, there are two studies on cotton and alfalfa with post-emergence application, covering different plant parts. The metabolism is considered to be similar in the evaluated crops. It would therefore be possible, to propose a general residue definition for all plant products. However, the most abundant plant metabolite, 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol, was not found in rat metabolism, and it could not be demonstrated that it is of lower toxicity than clomazone. The latter was almost completely degraded and, if present, only at low levels. At current, i.e. with respect to the representative uses evaluated, the amount of neither, clomazone and 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol, will be significant in food and feed items (i.e. below the trigger values). Therefore, with respect to the representative uses the relevant residue should be defined by default as clomazone. Further data and information on 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol will be needed in order to render possible a generally applicable plant residue definition. Metabolism studies in livestock animals are not necessary since residues in potential feedstuff is <0.1 mg/kg. Studies in succeeding crops or rotational crops are not required. Based on the currently available information it was assessed that no residues in rotational crops are expected after treatment of the primary crops according to critical GAP. A sufficient number of valid residue trials covering the relevant European growing areas allow for an MRL proposal for potato tubers and rape seed. Independently of the model used, the chronic consumer intake form the representative uses is estimated to be well below the ADI. (<1%). No ARfD is proposed and therefore an acute risk to consumers is not expected. Under laboratory aerobic conditions clomazone is moderate to high persistent in soil. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 31.5% AR and unextracted soil residues accounted for 15.2% AR. No major metabolite exceeding 10% of the applied radioactivity was detected in the laboratory soil metabolism studies. Under anaerobic conditions, the major metabolite N-R2-chlorobenzy01-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl propanamide was detected. In a laboratory soil batch adsorption/desorption study clomazone exhibited low to high mobility in soil. The aquatic degradation of clomazone was studied in two water/sediment studies and was shown to degrade relatively slowly in both systems. Two major metabolites FMC 65317 (N-R2-chlorobenzy013-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl propanamide) and FMC 55657 (N-[(2-chlorobenzyl)]-2-methyl propanamide were found in the water phase. The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift, runoff and drainage routes of entry for clomazone. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling is based on the longest degradation rate in soil as the recommended input value by FOCUS GW scenario guidance for PEC calculations with a number of 3 values for the parent compound. For the representative field uses applied for, the potential for groundwater exposure by clomazone above the drinking water limit of 0.1[Ig/L is low, except for regions with geoclimatic conditions represented by the Piacenza and Okehampton FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Studies were available to asses the risk to non-target organisms. The risk to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil macro- and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was concluded to be low. Risk mitigation comparable to a 5 m buffer zone is required to protect non-target plants outside the treated field.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benthiavalicarb,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.107r,"Benthiavalicarb is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 Belgium received an application from Kumiai Chemicals Industry Co Ltd for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision2. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State Belgium made available the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on benthiavalicarb, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), which was received by EFSA on 13 April 2004. The peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 16 December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 24 April 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the use as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprise foliar spraying to control Phytophthora infestans and Plasmopara viticola in grapes, tomatoes and potatoes. Due to the fact that the isopropyl ester, a variant of benthiavalicarb, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant benthiavalicarb-isopropyl, unless otherwise specified. Only the use of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl as a fungicide was evaluated. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""KIF-230 15% WG"" and ""KIF230/Mancozeb 17.5/700 WG"", both are water dispersible granules (WG). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. None of them are enantioselective. The methods determine all 4 possible isomers, but the pairs of enantiomers only as a sum. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Benthiavalicarb-isopropyl has a low acute toxicity after oral, dermal and inhalatory exposure. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant, while it is a skin sensitiser, therefore the classification as R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed. Overall, benthiavalicarb-isopropyl is not genotoxic both in-vivo and in-vitro assays. Benthiavalicarb-isopropyl is proposed for classification as Carc. Cat. 3 R40, due to the occurrence of uterine tumours in rats. The relevant NOAEL is 9.9 mg/kg bw/day either for general toxicity or for carcinogenicity (LOAEL 250 mg/kg bw/day). Benthiavalicarbisopropyl does not show reproductive toxicity potential: The relevant parental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, the pup NOAEL is 67.2 mg/kg bw/day and the reproductive toxicity NOAEL is 702.5 mg/kg bw/day (highest dose tested).The lowest relevant developmental NOAEL is established at 20 mg/kg bw/day, based upon the increased ossification delay and the increased dwarfism incidence at the top dose in rats. The findings were both considered associated with treatment. During the written procedure, EFSA considered that the proposal for R63 might be justified due to the maternal NOAEL > 20 mg/kg bw/day. The ADI is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2 year study in rats with an assessment factor of 100; the AOEL is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day derived from the rat teratogenicity study and an assessment factor of 100. The allocation of the ARfD was not deemed necessary based on the toxicological profile of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl. The operator exposure assessment shows estimated exposure levels below the AOEL (German model), even without the use of PPE; the estimated worker and bystander exposure for the worst case scenario represents about 48% and 1% of the AOEL, respectively. The metabolism of benthiavalicarb was investigated in grapes, tomatoes and potatoes after a foliar treatment with radio -labelled benthiavalicarb-isopropyl. Potato metabolism was also studied after a soil treatment. In all crops investigated, benthiavalicarb-isopropyl was the major component of the terminal residue. A pH induced isomerisation of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl into the diastereomer KIF230 S-L was observed in the tomato study. In general, only minor amounts of metabolites of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl were generated; and they were partially present as free metabolites but mainly conjugated with glucose. None of the metabolites identified in primary crops was found to be of a particular toxicological concern. A cleavage of the amide bond, as occurring in soil, was not observed in primary crop metabolism studies. However, no sufficient data are currently available to address the concern about a potential selective uptake of toxicologically relevant metabolites from soil. Given the residue situation in crops that are relevant as animal feed items, no significant residues in livestock diet are expected. However, this assessment may have to be reviewed upon receipt of further data on investigation of residues in rotational crops potentially used as feed items. Assessment of the safety of different consumers groups indicates that the intake of residues of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl (including potentially present residues of KIF230 S -D, KIF 230 S -L and KiF 230 R -D) resulting from the supported representative uses is well below the toxicological reference value for chronic exposure (ADI) for benthiavalicarb-isopropyl. Potential contribution from animal commodities and succeeding crops were not included in the calculations. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that for the uses with a combi-formulation (grapevines, tomatoes, potatoes) containing besides benthiavalicarb-isopropyl also mancozeb, the consumer risk assessment could not be completed, since no assessment with regard to mancozeb residues was carried out. Benthiavalicarb-isopropyl is moderately persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. In the experiments performed with the 14C-phenyl-benthiavalicarb-isopropyl four major soil transformation products were identified: Ml; M3; M4 and M5. Bound residues reached a maximum of 58.2 % AR and mineralization was between 3.6 11.7 % AR at 120 d. No isomeric conversion of the active substance was observed in any of the experiments. Data from the parent study M5 was shown to be moderately persistent. The degradation of the transformation products Ml, M3 and M4 was investigated in separated studies with three soils. M1 was shown to be low to moderately persistent, M3 low persistent and M4 very low persistent to moderate persistent in soil. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 C benthiavalicarb-isopropyl was slightly more persistent than in aerobic ones. Transformation product M8 was found in higher amounts in anaerobic conditions and should be considered as a major soil anaerobic metabolite with respect to the ground water exposure assessment. In the experiment performed with the 14C-valyl-benthiavalicarb-isopropyl labelled experiment no metabolites were identified. Photolysis is not expected to contribute to the degradation of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl in soil. PEC soil were calculated by the RMS based on the worst case laboratory half life of 19.1 d and the representative uses with 50 % interception. Applicant provided a PEC soil calculation assuming no degradation between application and resulting in a more worse case with respect to the RMS proposal. Maximum amount observed of metabolites was applied to this worst case PEC soil for the parent to calculate maximum PEC soil of metabolites. Batch adsorption / desorption studies show that benthiavalicarb-isopropyl is high to medium mobile, Ml, M3 and M4 are medium mobile and M5 is medium to low mobile in soil. Benthiavalicarbisopropyl may be considered stable to hydrolysis under most common environmental conditions. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of benthiavalicarb-isopropyl in acidic waters (pH 5: DT50 = 6.8 d). Benthiavalicarb-isopropyl is not readily biodegradable according the available study. In water / sediment systems, benthiavalicarb-isopropyl partitions to the sediment where it breaks down to the metabolites M3, M4 and M5. No major metabolites were identified in the water phase.",NA

The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Switch 62.5 WG"", a water dispersible granule (WG), and ""Celest 025 FS"", a suspension concentrate for seed treatment (FS). The dispersible granule formulation contains also cyprodinil as active substance. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Fludioxonil is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal and inhalation route (LD50>5000 mg/kg/bw, LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and LC50 >2.6 mg/L, respectively). It is not a skin and eye irritant. Fludioxonil is not a skin sensitiser. Target organs after repeated oral administration are liver in rats, mice and dogs (increased weight, hepatocyte hypertrophy, bile duct proliferation) and kidneys in rats and mice (increased weight, nephropathy). The relevant oral NOAEL is 58.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in dog. The NOAEL from the repeated dose dermal study in rats is 200 mg/kg bw/day. Fludioxonil does not show any genotoxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant NOAEL for chronic toxicity is 37 mg/kg bw/day. The ADI of fludioxonil is 0.37 mg/kg bw/day from the relevant long term/carcinogenicity NOAEL applying a safety factor of 100. The proposed AOEL is 0.59 mg/kg bw/day from the NOAEL of the 90-day study in dogs with a safety factor of 100. The allocation of an ARfD was not considered necessary. Fludioxonil is intended to be used on wine and table grapes (WG formulation) and on wheat (FS formulation). The systemic exposure of operators, workers and bystanders to fludioxonil formulated as WG was estimated to be below the established AOEL, as well as for the FS formulation. The behaviour of fludioxonil residues applied according to the representative uses is fully understood and no further data is necessary. The plant metabolism of the compound proceeds through oxidative processes of the pyrrole ring. The metabolic pattern is clearly dominated by the parent compound after foliar application. Seed treatment of cereals leads to extremely low residue levels in straw and grains. The proposed residue definition for monitoring is fludioxonil. For risk assessment the residue definition should include all metabolites containing the 2,2-difluoro-benzo[1,3]dioxole-4-carboxylic moiety, to cover potential uses of fludioxonil in other commodities not addressed during the peer review. MRLs can be proposed to be set at 3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg and 0.05* mg/kg in wine grapes, table grapes and wheat respectively. The transfer of residues from soil to rotational crops and from feeding stuffs to livestock is very low and does not result in detectable or quantifiable levels in food items. The expected chronic consumer exposure is far below the ADI. Photolysis plays a major role for the degradation pathway and degradation rate of fludioxonil in soil. Major metabolites are formed in light but not in the dark. As the intended uses of fludioxonil is both foliar spray and seed treatment the pronounced role of photolysis on degradation of fludioxonil and formation of metabolites results in major differences in the fate and behaviour for the two different intended uses. Aerobic degradation in the laboratory studies in the dark resulted in the formation of CO2 and bound residues. Only few fractions of metabolites in small amounts were detected. In field soil dissipation studies without light exposure no significant amounts of metabolites was found. Fludioxonil is rated as highly to very highly persistent in laboratory studies in the dark, with first order half-life under",NA
[Anonymous],` Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenoxaprop-P,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.121r,"Fenoxaprop-P is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenoxaprop-P in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 2 May 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 22 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August-September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying to spring and winter-sown varieties of wheat, durum wheat, rye, triticale, spring and winter barley, at rates up to a maximum of 83 ga.s./ha for the control of annual grass weeds, in Northern and Southern Europe, either one application in autumn or one in spring or one application in autumn and one in spring. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Puma S 69EW"", an emulsion oil in water (EW), containing fenoxaprop-P-ethyl as the active substance and mefenpyr-diethyl as safener, registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The analytical methods to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition for plants are non enantio-selective and are not specific to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. Due to a similar toxicological profile in acute, short term, genotoxicity and developmental studies, the long term and reproductive studies performed with fenoxaprop-ethyl were considered sufficiently representative to be used for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl was rapidly and extensively absorbed, and of low acute toxicity. Nevertheless, the classification with R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact was proposed. In repeat dose studies, the target organs were the liver and the kidneys. Negative results were obtained in mutagenicity tests, and no evidence of carcinogenic properties was observed in rats, mice or dogs. No effects on the reproductive parameters were noted, but there was some indication of teratogenicity in the rat developmental studies leading to the proposal Toxic to Repr. cat. 3, R63?. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.014 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The estimated operator exposure level is below the AOEL with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and spraying, and coverall during spraying (according to the German model). The metabolism of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl in cereals is clearly elucidated. Shortly after application the parent compound is hydrolysed to the acid form which is still biologically active. Fenoxaprop-P acid is further degraded by ether cleavage with formation of chlorobenzoxazolone and phenoxypropionic acid moieties, each undergoing conjugation processes. Very early, these moieties represent the major part of the residual content and it is therefore proposed to adopt as residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment the sum of the parent compound and all metabolites containing the chlorobenzoxazolone moiety. The plant residue pattern is covered by the toxicological studies conducted with the parent compound. Resulting from the early stage of application and of the absence of any translocation potential, residues in grains and straw are expected to be low in mature cereals and supervised residue trials actually demonstrate that they do not exceed analytical limits of quantification (0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg in grains and straw respectively). The MRL in cereals is therefore proposed to be set at the LOQ level. Due to the absence of residues in straw livestock exposure is very low and there is no need to establish a residue definition and MRLs for animal commodities. It must however be noted that if fenoxaprop-P-ethyl is applied later than the latest growth stage of application supported as representative use, significant residues may be present in straw and in this case the transfer of residues to animal products should be reconsidered. The effect of processing on the residues was not investigated given the low residues in raw grains. The transfer of soil residues to rotational crops was investigated and concluded to be negligible. Chronic and acute consumer exposure assessments were conducted and found to be far below the respective toxicological reference values. In soil under dark aerobic conditions, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl or fenoxaprop-ethyl was rapidly hydrolysed to the active fenoxaprop-P or fenoxaprop. The only major metabolite identified in the route studies was the chlorobenzoxazolone. Also under anaerobic conditions fenoxaprop-P or fenoxaprop was rapidly produced. Under these conditions a major metabolite hydroxy phenoxy propionic acid (HOPP-acid, AE F020686) was identified. Under anaerobic conditions, fenoxaprop-P was moderate persistent, metabolite chlorobenzoxazolone was moderate persistent and anaerobic metabolite hydroxy phenoxy propionic acid was very high persistent under anaerobic conditions. After the experts' meeting, EFSA identified a data gap for the information necessary to address the major anaerobic metabolite HOPP-acid in soil and ground water to address situations were anaerobic conditions are prevalent. Contribution of photolysis to the degradation of fenoxaprop-ethyl in soil was relevant but limited when compared with degradation under aerobic conditions. PEC soil for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, fenoxaprop-P and chlorobenzoxazolone were calculated for the representative use. From the results of batch soil adsorption /desorption studies fenoxaprop-P-ethyl may be classified as immobile in soil, fenoxaprop-P as medium to low mobile and chlorobenzoxazolone as medium to low mobile. Hydrolysis of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl at 25 degrees C is pH dependent (DT50 (pH 4) = 2.8 d; DT50 (pH 5) = 19.2 d; DT50 (pH 7) = 23.2 d; DT50 pH 9 = 0.6 d). Hydrolysis of fenoxaprop-P at 25 degrees C is also pH dependent being practically stable at neutral pH (DT50 pH 5 = 26.8 d; DT50 pH 7 = 182.7 d; DT50 pH 9 = 33 d). Main hydrolysis product of fenoxaprop-P is chlrobenzoxazolone (max 37.7 % AR). Chlorobenzoxazolone is hydrolytically stable (DT50 > 1 yr). Aqueous photolysis fenoxaprop-P-ethyl was investigated at 25 degrees C in natural surface water (pH 9), and two sterile systems (pH 5 and 6.8). Main photolysis metabolite (not observed in the dark control) was observed at pH 9: AE 0316854 (6-hydroxy-2,3-dyhydro-benzoxazol-2-one, max 27.4 % AR). In the other experiments metabolites found were common to the ones found in the dark control. Half lives calculated assuming 12 h sunshine were between 7.1 d (natural system, pH 9) and 127.8 d (distilled water, pH 6.8). Aqueous photolysis of soil aerobic metabolite chlorobenzoxazolone was also investigated at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. A photolysis half life of 1.42 d was observed that could be translated to environmental half lives of 7.4 d to 50.6 d depending on the latitude and season. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and fenoxaprop-P are considered not to be readily biodegradable. In the two dark aerobic water /sediment systems investigated fenoxaprop-P-ethyl was rapidly hydrolysed to fenoxaprop-P that is subsequently adsorbed to sediment and transformed (DT50 total system = 8.3 - 46.3 d) to HOPP-acid (AE F 096918) and chlorobenzoxazolone (AE F054014). HOPP-acid is subsequently degraded. At the end of the studies (118 199 d), the vast majority of the radioactivity was transformed into unextractable residues (27.4-69.1 % AR) and CO2 (max. 16.9-45.9 % AR). PECSW were calculated for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, fenoxaprop-P, chlorobenzoxazolone and HOPP-acid following the FOCUS SW scheme up to Step 2. For the representative uses proposed none of the calculated concentrations of the potential residue components exceeds the trigger values of 0.1 mu g / L. Long term transport of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and fenoxaprop-P through the atmosphre is not expected based on their physical and chemical properties. The risk to birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. The acute TER values for earthworms were well above the Annex VI trigger for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and the soil metabolites fenoxaprop-P and chlorobenzoxazolone. No long-term risk assessment was triggered since the DT90 in soil is < 100 days and the product is applied only once per year. The RMS pointed out that particular attention should be paid to potential long-term effects if fenoxaprop-Pethyl is applied in regions with lower temperatures where fenoxaprop-P is more persistent. The same applies if fenoxaprop-P-ethyl is used where anaerobic conditions occur. Under anaerobic conditions the metabolites fenoxaprop-P, chlorobenzoxazolone and the HOPP-acid (AE F020686) are assumed to be persistent. The TER for non-target plants in the off-field area was below the trigger of 5 and risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres are required.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance quinoclamine,2007,EFSA JOURNAL,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.117r,"Quinoclamine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on quinoclamine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 June 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Agro-Kanesho Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October-November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide/algaecide on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants as proposed by the applicant, full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mogeton"", a wettable powder (WP) containing 250 g/kg of active substance. Methods are not required for food of plant or animal origin as the use is on ornamentals, turf, lawns and nursery stock plants. Adequate methods are available to monitor quinoclamine in soil, drinking water and air. A confirmatory method for surface water was identified as a data gap in the meeting of experts. A confirmatory method for surface water has been provided by the applicant but it has not been evaluated and therefore is not peer reviewed. Some analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, a method of analysis for the relevant impurity dichlone (2,3-dichloro-1,4naphthoquinone) is not available. The acute oral toxicity of quinoclamine is moderate (R22 Harmful if swallowed) but the acute toxicity by inhalation or dermal application is low. The substance is irritating to the eyes (R36 Irritant to eyes) but not to the skin, and has sensitizing properties (R43 May cause sensitization by skin contact). Indications of haemolytic anaemia are observed in the short term studies in rats and dogs. Quinoclamine does not show a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential, but some teratogenic effects were observed and lead to the proposed classification Repro cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.002 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.03 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw. The dermal absorption values are 6.52% for the concentrate and the low dilution, and 10% for the high dilution. The operator exposure estimates in field or greenhouse are below the AOEL only when personal protective equipment is used. Preliminary estimates of children exposure show that the AOEL might be exceeded when the exposure occurs on the day of treatment. Very high residue levels are present on grass directly after application of quinoclamine. A metabolism study demonstrated that parent compound is the main constituent of the residue on grass up to 2 weeks after application. Therefore only quinoclamine needs to be considered for risk assessment related to humans and terrestrial vertebrates in contact with treated lawn and turf. One decline study demonstrated that residues decrease rapidly in favourable condition of grass growth. Also grass clipping results in low residues in regrown grass. Nevertheless it cannot be excluded that the decline of residues in grass may be significantly slower when growth rate of grass due to environmental conditions is weak. The need for further studies should therefore be considered at national level. As a risk-mitigation measure related to human and wildlife exposure, label should give the user clear recommendations to apply the product in strong growing conditions of grass, and practical instructions to irrigate efficiently the treated area in case of low precipitation level, in accordance with the biological efficiency of the product. Quinoclamine is moderately persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C and produces a number of minor metabolites (< 5 % AR). Quinoclamine ultimately degrades to non extractable residues and mineralizes to CO2. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine is low persistent and yields two main metabolites: AN and DHN. Light may enhance the degradation of quinoclamine but its contribution to overall degradation in soil is deemed low due to the rapid microbiological degradation. A field study is available where Mogeton 25WP (15 Kg /ha; 3.75 Kg a. s. /ha) was applied in four sites (two in spring and two in autumn) in Germany on bare soil. Only data from the spring trials was found relevant for the representative uses applied at EU level (spring application). PEC soil were calculated based on the field worst case spring application half life (DT50 = 29 d). The expert's meeting agreed that for uses in autumn longer dissipation pattern observed in autumn field trials would need to be considered. In that case, new kinetic analysis of the two autumn field studies would be necessary. Quinoclamine may be considered low mobile in soil according the batch adsorption/desorption studies available. According the available study quinoclamine is expected to be stable to hydrolysis under environmental conditions (pH 4-9, 20 degrees C). According the aqueous photolysis study available in the original dossier quinoclamine has a short half life in water under irradiated conditions (2.2 d, corresponding to 4.2 d with 12 h irradiation per day in UK). A data gap was identified during the peer review for further information on non identified photolysis metabolites. In a new study, photolysis was slower. Two major photolysis metabolites were identified: phthalic acid and 2-carboxybenzaldehide. The two major photolysis metabolites were considered by the RMS in the updated risk assessment presented in the addendum. According the available study quinoclamine is not ready biodegradable. In dark water /sediment at 20 degrees C, quinoclamine partitioned to the sediment and degraded in whole system with a first order half life of 14-15 d. Metabolite AN reached levels above 10 % AR in the sediment. For the assessment of the representative use in lawns/turf, PECSW were calculated with the FOCUS SW scheme up to Step 3 using whole water /sediment degradation half lives. Only global maximum PECSW have been used in the risk assessment. Based on this PECSW calculation a risk for aquatic organisms was identified. The FOCUS SW Step 4 calculations presented by the notifier were not found acceptable because input parameters employed deviated from those recommended by the RMS and agreed by the peer review and/or due to the implementation of additional mitigation by VFS or by spray shields. Also the experts in the meeting agreed that for uses on turf (particularly golf courses and other sport facilities) drainage should be considered a potential route of entry to surface water. However, the meeting agreed that available Step 4 calculations give an indication that significant mitigation regarding run off and spray drift will be necessary to mitigate risk to aquatic environment for the proposed representative use in turf /lawn. Applicant proposed that potential surface water contamination due to use in ornamental plants in pots may be managed in a way that contamination of surface water will be negligible. RMS calculated spray drift PECSW for the use on pots outdoor. During the experts meeting, it was indicated that in the case of pots standing in a hard surface high potential of surface water contamination as a consequence of run off is also possible. As there is not agreed way of dealing with run off from hard surfaces at EU level, it was agreed that this issue would have to be addressed a MS level. Potential contamination of ground water for the use in turf was addressed following the FOCUS GW scheme with FOCUS PRZM (v 3.2.1. b). The resulting 80th percentile annual average concentrations of quinoclamine at 1m depth were below 0.001 mu g / L in all the FOCUS GW scenarios. Due to the low potential of volatilization and the estimated rapid photochemical transformation, the environmental concentrations in air and the transport through air are considered negligible. The representative uses of quinoclamine are against algae and mosses in lawns/turf, ornamentals (outdoors) and nursery stock plants (out-and indoor). The risk assessment was focussed on the use in lawns and turf. Exposure of birds and mammals from the outdoor use in ornamentals was considered as negligible. The first-tier TERs for large herbivorous and small insectivorous birds were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The risk refinements based on residue decline in grass was accepted by the experts. However other suggested refinements were rejected and further data are required to refine the short-term risk to herbivorous birds, the short-term and long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The acute and long-term TERs for herbivorous mammals were below the triggers of 10 and 5. The refined long-term TER based on residue decline was calculated as 5.8. However the acute risk to mammals needs to be addressed further. Fish and daphnids were the most sensitive aquatic organisms triggering the acute and long-term risk assessment. No-spray buffer zones of up to 100 m are not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers for the use in lawns/turf. The TER calculation of the RMS for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants indicated that a distance of 20m is not sufficient to mitigate the risk. However no agreed exposure scenario exists for the outdoor use in ornamentals and nursery stock plants. Therefore it was agreed that a risk assessment should be conducted at Member state level. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance acequinocyl,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.125r,"Acequinocyl is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC1 the Netherlands received an application from Agro- Kanesho for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/636/EC2. Following the agreement between the EU- Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State the Netherlands made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on acequinocyl, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 8 March 2005. This draft assessment report was distributed for consultation to the Member States and the notifier on 15 March 2005. The peer review was initiated on 15 March 2005 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in November 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 15 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying to control spider mite in ornamentals, apples and pears. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Kanemite"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 164 g/L acequinocyl, provisionally registered in Austria and Germany as Kanemite and in the Netherlands as Cantack. The technical specification is still open for formal reasons. A new specification was submitted and presented in an addendum to vol. 4 according to the requirements of the expert meeting PRAPeR6, however, this final specification was not peer reviewed. Adequate methods are available to monitor the compounds given in the respective residue definitions Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Regarding the mammalian metabolism, there are distinct indications for sizeable biliary first pass elimination. However, based on the critical effect of acequinocyl, the extent of oral absorption was considered to represent 28% of the administered dose. Twenty-four hours after dosing, the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in the gastro-intestinal tract and its contents; excretion occurs predominantly via faeces and no potential for accumulation was seen. Acequinocyl is extensively metabolized with 0-2.5% parent compound found in urine, bile or faeces. Acequinocyl has low acute toxicity and is not a skin or eye irritant; however classification is required for skin sensitization based on a Maximisation test. In repeated dose studies, acequinocyl caused haematological effects (increased platelet levels and blood clotting time) in rats, mice and dogs; in addition, ocular effects were observed in the rats and hepatotoxicity in mice. The relevant short term NOAEL was the dose level of 5 mg/kg bw/day derived from the 52-week dog study, and the long term relevant NOAEL was the dose level of 2.3 mg/kg bw/day derived from the 2-year rat study. No genotoxic or carcinogenic potential was observed. Acequinocyl showed no effect on fertility parameters and produced effects on the reproductive or developmental parameters in rats or rabbits only at parental toxic doses. No potential for neurotoxicity was evidenced. Four acute studies in rats and monkey were submitted to investigate the effects of acequinocyl on the blood clotting system resulting in an overall NOAEL of 8 mg/kg bw for prolongation of blood clotting time in rats. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.023 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) at 0.08 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is set at 0.014 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 357 (correction of 28% for oral absorption). Dermal absorption is 3.6% when handling the concentrate formulation and 16.7% when handling the spray dilution. Considering the representative uses of Kanemite SC outdoor (apple/pear and ornamentals), the estimated operator exposure exceeds the AOEL according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure is below the AOEL when the use of PPE as protective gloves during mixing/loading and gloves, protective garment and sturdy footwear during application is considered. According to the Dutch model for greenhouse applications (ornamentals), the exposure of operators was calculated to represent twice the AOEL when using a reduction factor of 10% for the use of PPE. Worker exposure after outdoor applications on apple and pear (mechanical upward spraying) is estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of PPE, but for downward application on ornamentals, outdoor and in greenhouses, the use of gloves is required to obtain a level of exposure lower than the AOEL. Exposure of bystanders is estimated to be below the AOEL. The metabolism of acequinocyl in fruit crops is clearly elucidated. For PHIs up to 30 days, the parent compound is the major constituent of the residue and no metabolite was found in amounts suggesting a significant contribution to the toxicological burden. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment can therefore be restricted to acequinocyl. Supervised residue trials were performed in Northern and Southern Europe and form a sufficient basis for proposing an MRL to be set at 0.05 mg/kg in apples and pears. Considering this low residue level, no study on the effect of processing was estimated necessary. No information has been provided on the potential transfer of soil residues to rotational or succeeding crops considering that cultivation of edible agricultural or horticultural crops in rotation with the representative uses does not normally occurs in practice. In case this should be possible practice at national level, Member States should consider the opportunity of label restriction. A metabolism study in lactating goat was submitted although not required given that livestock exposure through consumption of apple pomace is extremely low. This study was considered but not used for proposing a residue definition. Consumer chronic and acute exposures are well below the toxicological reference values and no dietary risk is expected resulting from the use of acequinocyl following the supported representative uses. In soil under aerobic conditions acequinocyl exhibits very low to low persistence. The major metabolite was R13 (max 33.8% AR after 2 days) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. A second major metabolite was identified as AKM-184 (max 21.9% AR after 2 days), which showed low persistence in soil. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 15.0-57.7 % AR after 120/180 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 46.3% AR after 120 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions no novel breakdown products were identified. Acequinocyl and its major metabolites can be classified as immobile in soil and have a very low potential for leaching in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acequinocyl or metabolites R1 and AKM-18 was pH dependant. Hydrolysis is pH dependant with more rapid hydrolysis under alkaline conditions. The water/sediment test showed that acequinocyl dissipated rapidly from the water phase by partitioning to sediment (max 26.4% AR after 1d). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink for radioactivity, representing 59.7-62.0% R after 30-60 days. Metabolites R1 and CBAA5 were detected as major metabolites in the water phase, metabolite AKM-18 is a major metabolite in the sediment phase. Predicted environmental concentrations in surface water to be used in the risk assessment for the representative uses form the spray drift route of exposure have been calculated for acequinocyl (actual and TWA PECsw) and metabolites R1 and CBAA (maximum PECsw). The runoff and drainage routes of exposure to surface water bodies should be taken into account by MS when these routes of exposure are relevant and the pertinent risk assessments to aquatic organisms should be completed by MS. For the representative uses proposed by the applicant, the potential for contamination of vulnerable groundwater by acequinocyl and its soil breakdown products above the drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is considered minimal. The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals was assessed as low in the firsttier risk assessment. A refined long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals was required. The suggested refinement steps were rejected in the experts meeting. The long-term TER of 4.3 for insectivorous birds in orchards was below the trigger of 5 but considered as sufficient to conclude on a low risk since the available information on residue decline in insects suggest a rapid decline with a DT50 of < 3 days. A data gap was identified to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds for the use in ornamentals. The PT values proposed to refine the long-term risk to mammals were rejected because no supporting data were made available. Acequinocyl is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. In the meeting of experts it was agreed that the aquatic risk assessment should be based on the NOEC (population effects) of 3 mu g acequinocyl/L derived from a microcosm study together with an assessment factor of 3-5. No spray buffer zones of 30 m (orchards late application and ornamentals > 50 cm high) and 10 m (ornamentals < 50 cm high) are required to achieve TERs of > 5. In order to reach a TER of > 3 for the early use in orchards a no spray buffer zone of 30 m is required and the buffer zone needs to be extended to 50 m to achieve a TER of > 5. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-and microorganisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fuberidazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.118r,"Fuberidazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fuberidazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 5 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 20 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises seed treatment to winter-sown varieties of wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale against Fusarium spp., bunt, smut in Northern Europe at rates up to a maximum of 34.5 g a. s./tonne seed in wheat, oats, rye and triticale and 45.0 g a. s./tonne seed in winter barley. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Baytan FS-094, a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing fuberidazole, triadimenol and imazalil. Fuberidazole is used only in mixtures. In other mixed formulations fuberidazole is co-formulated with bitertanol, or with bitertanol, triazoxide and triadimenol. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Fuberidazole is harmful if swallowed; it is not acutely toxic via skin and inhalation routes (dermal LD50>5000 mg/kg bw and LC50 >0.4 mg/L) It is not a skin or eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser. Dogs were the more sensitive species. In the 90 day dog study focal fibrosis of the left ventricular fibrillary muscles was observed and the weights of some endocrine organs were increased by treatment in males and uterine weights in females. The relevant short term NOAEL was 0.72 mg/kg bw/day from the 1 year study in dog. With regard to the heart fibrosis in dogs the classification: T, R48/25? or Xn; R48/22? was proposed to be flagged to ECB. Overall, it was agreed that fuberidazole has no genotoxic potential. The relevant long term oral NOAEL in rats is 4.6 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of hepatocellular hypertrophy in males at 400 ppm (23 and 29 mg/kg bw/day in males and females, respectively) which represents the NOAEL for neoplastic effects, due to the occurrence of uterine and thyroid tumours in females at 155 mg/kg bw/day. Due to these uncertainties the meeting proposed to highlight this issue to ECB for final decision indicating "" R40?"" for discussion. The relevant parental NOAEL was established to be 25 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive and offspring NOAELs were set at 4 mg/kg bw/day, based on reduced viability index. Thus fuberidazole was proposed for classification as R 62?"", because of effects occurring without any parental toxicity. Fuberidazole was not teratogenic either in rats or rabbits. The ADI is 0.0072 mg/kg bw/day, based on the NOAEL of 1 year dog study with a SF of 100; the AOEL was set at 0.0036mg/kg bw/day, based on the same study and correcting by a factor of 0.5 because of biliary excretion. An acute reference dose of 0.08 mg/kg bw/day is set based on the developmental NOAEL of 8 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100. The operator exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL (31% and 17% for seed dressing and seed loading, respectively). No re-entry or bystander exposure is expected). The main metabolic pathways of fuberidazole in wheat are similar to those observed in rats. Residues of the parent compound and its metabolites in wheat straw and grains are below limits of quantification of methods of analysis. Fuberidazole is proposed as residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring and MRLs for cereals are proposed to be set at 0.05* mg/kg (limit of quantification). No transfer of residues from soil to rotational crop is expected. As livestock exposure is extremely low, MRLs for animal products do not need to be set. Consumer exposure is minimal and far below toxicological reference values. The data available are considered sufficient to elucidate the likely route of degradation of fuberidazole in soil. The metabolites M01(2) and M11(3) will be formed (M01 up to 15.4% AR at 120 days and M11 at a maximum of 5.9% AR at day 62) but these subsequently degrade, mineralising to CO2. Mineralisation of fuberidazole to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.1-16.1% AR after 90 days. Dissipation to unextracted residues (40.5-53% AR at day 90) will also be a route of dissipation in the soil environment. In a laboratory soil photolysis study degradation was faster than in the dark control and the novel metabolite oxobutanal benzimidazole (M15(4)) was identified at up to 9.4% AR. However, for the proposed use as a seed treatment, the process of drilling seed will exclude light, so under the notified intended use conditions, photolytic breakdown at the soil surface will not occur. Fuberidazole exhibited moderate to medium persistence in soil. Dissipation was best characterised by a biphasic first order pattern with transition between initial relatively rapid dissipation to slower dissipation at 14-15 days after treatment. Metabolite M01 showed low to moderate persistence in soil. Fuberidazole exhibited low to medium mobility in soil and metabolite M01 exhibited medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either fuberidazole or M01 was pH dependant. Under sterile conditions fuberidazole was relatively rapidly photolysed in water, producing 2-carboxybenzimidazole (M01; max. 11.1% AR) and two novel breakdown products: cis-oxobutenoic acid (M16(5), max. 46.3% AR) and trans-oxobutenoic acid, (M17(6); max. 22.1% AR). In natural sediment water systems parent fuberidazole dissipated rapidly from water by partitioning to the sediment. In the sediment it degraded to the minor metabolites 2-carboxybenzimidazole (M01) (formed at up to 7% AR) and 2-acetylbenzimidazole (M11) (formed at up to 6.2% AR). Unextracted residues were the major sink accounting for 53.5-70.1% AR at study end (100 days). Mineralisation to CO2 also occurred, accounting for 9.4-23.5% AR at study end (100 days). The rapid partitioning to sediment seen for parent fuberidazole would minimise the possibility of significant amounts of photodegradation products being formed under actual use conditions in small edge of field water bodies. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fuberidazole and its major metabolite M01 at steps 1-2. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent fuberidazole and its major soil metabolite 2carboxybenzimidazole (M01), was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute risk to birds and mammals was considered to be low. The long-term TER value for birds was below the Annex VI trigger but since exposure will be outside of breeding season, and of short duration due to seed germination, the risk for reproductive effects was nevertheless considered to be low. The long-term risk assessment for mammals in the DAR was based on a NOAEL of 117.7 mg a. s./kg bw/day (1250 mg a.s./kg diet) derived from a 2-generation study with rat. However lactation index was partly affected at the next lower dose of (250 mg a. s./kg diet) and a reduction in viability (15-30 % reduced survival within the first 5 days after birth) was observed in F2B generations at dose levels of 25 and 117.7 mg a.s./kg bw/day. The setting of the endpoint was discussed in the expert meeting taking into account also effects observed in developmental studies with rats and rabbits. NOELs of 8 mg/kg bw/day (skeletal effects) and 30 mg/kg bw/day (reduced foetal weights) were derived for exposure periods of day 6 to day 18 (and 19) of pregnancy. The RMS considers these developmental effects as not relevant for the long-term risk assessment of mammals. However the results indicate that relatively short exposure during critical life stages can lead to adverse developmental effects at dose rates below the originally suggested NOAEL of 117.7 mg a. s./kg bw/d. The experts on toxicology regarded the reduced viability index as a relevant effect for human risk assessment and suggest a NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/day. Taking all the information available into consideration EFSA proposes a precautionary approach using the endpoint of 4 mg/kg bw/day in the long-term risk assessment. The resulting TERlt would be 0.4 indicating a potential high long-term risk to mammals and the need for refinement of the exposure assessment.. Also the risk to aquatic organisms, bees, other non-target arthropods, soil organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was considered to be low from exposure to fuberidazole. Since the representative formulated product contains two additional active substances, the risk from combined toxicity needs to be addressed for birds, mammals, aquatic organisms, the standard non-target arthropods Typhlodromus pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi, earthworms and soil micro-organisms at product authorisation.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance amidosulfuron,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.116r,"Amidosulfuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on amidosulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 3 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in a written procedure in September 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant on cereals, linseed, meadows and pasture. For full details of the GAP see the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Gratil"", a water dispersible granule formulation (WG) containing 750 g/kg amidosulfuron. Methods are available to monitor for amidosulfuron in plants, soil, water and air. There are no acceptable methods available for products of animal origin and it is not concluded if MRLs will be set or not. For water the residue definition for ground water is not concluded on and therefore further methods may be required. For surface water a data gap for a method of analysis for AEF101630 has been identified. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multiresidue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The acute toxicity of amidosulfuron is low. In short term studies, the dog is the most sensitive species with effects observed in clinical chemical parameters and urinalysis. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential was observed. The reproductive parameters and foetal/offspring development were not affected. No evidence of neurotoxicity was shown. The identified groundwater metabolites were considered not relevant, and the plant metabolites of lower or equal toxicity than amidosulfuron. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.2 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 1.4 mg/kg bw/day, and no acute reference dose (ARfD) was considered needed. The default dermal absorption value is 100%. The operator, worker and bystander exposure assessments are below the AOEL, even without the use of personal protective equipment. Amidosulfuron is extensively metabolised in cereals and oilseeds. A main metabolite ( AEF1016302) has been identified in immature plants shortly after application. Due the use of the active substance at early growth stages of wheat and linseed no residue of compounds structurally related to the parent compound is expected in mature wheat grains and straw as well as in linseed. The proposed residue definition for monitoring of cereals and oilseeds is per default restricted to the parent compound. The absence of residues of amidosulfuron and its main plant metabolite AEF101630 in mature plant commodities has been confirmed by field supervised residue trials. MRLs for amidosulfuron are therefore proposed to be set at the LOQ level in cereal grains and linseed. The residue definition in plant products for risk assessment is however proposed to be the sum of the parent compound and metabolite AEF101630. This is resulting from the specific residue pattern observed in pasture, at the time ruminants may re-enter in the treated area. Seven to 14 days after application residues in the order of magnitude of 1 mg/kg of both parent compound and metabolite AEF101630 can be present in grass. This leads to a significant exposure of livestock, and a metabolism study in lactating goat suggests that for this exposure rate, low, but measurable residues of the parent compound could be present in milk and kidneys. The metabolism of metabolite AEF101630 in livestock has not been investigated, but the animal metabolic behaviour of this compound is expected to be similar to that of the parent compound. Considering this, the residue definition in products of animal origin for both monitoring and risk assessment is proposed to include the parent compound and metabolite AEF101630. In order to obtain appropriate information for MRL setting a feeding study in lactating cows should be conducted, preferably with simultaneous administration of amidosulfuron and metabolite AEF101630 at a 1 to 1 ratio, reflecting the exposure resulting from consumption of grass or hay under worst case conditions. No residues of compounds structurally related to amidosulfuron are expected in rotational crops. Even in the absence of the requested feeding study in ruminants, it can be concluded that the representative uses of amidosulfuron in wheat, linseed and pasture, do not involve any risk for the consumer. In soil under aerobic conditions amidosulfuron exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites AEF101630 (accounting for up to 50% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence, AEF1288703 (up to 39% AR) and AE15693094 (up to 12.1% AR) both of which exhibit moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of the pyrimidinyl ring radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 3-47 % AR after ca. 100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 19-46 % AR after ca. 100 days. In soil under anaerobic conditions amidosulfuron degraded more slowly than under aerobic conditions and formed the major soil metabolite AEF0942065 (10.9% AR) which exhibited high persistence under anaerobic conditions. Amidosulfuron exhibits very high to high mobility in soil, with the metabolites AEF101630, AEF128870, AE1569309, AEF094206 unidentified 'C' and unidentified 'D' characterised as exhibiting very high soil mobility on the basis of the available data. There was no indication that adsorption of amidosulfuron was pH dependant. Whilst there was some indication of pH dependant adsorption for metabolites, as adsorption of these was already identified as very low the experts agreed this did not need to be taken into account in the exposure assessments in this case. In dark natural sediment water systems amidosulfuron remained primarily in the water phase and degraded exhibiting moderate to medium persistence to the major metabolites AEF101630 (12.3% AR) and AEF94206 (17.1% AR) in water. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 8.5 % AR (pyrimidinyl radiolabel) at 98days. Unextracted sediment residues were a major sink representing 11-63 % AR at 98 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for amidosulfuron at steps 1-3. For the metabolites AEF101630, [ AEF128870 and AEF1569309 that may leach from soil to surface water] appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. For AEF094206 it was agreed appropriate to use the values calculated for amidosulfuron. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure, from the applied for intended use on meadows and pasture by amidosulfuron and the soil metabolites that trigger an assessment above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the intended use of spring applications to winter cereals the potential for groundwater exposure of amidosulfuron, AEF101630 and unidentified 'C' is low at all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolites AEF128870, AE1569309, AEF094206 and unidentified 'D' contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit cannot be excluded. Agreed metabolite non relevance assessments are available for AEF128870, AE1569309, AEF094206 and AEF101630 that concluded none of these metabolites are relevant for groundwater. However due to the fact that 'D' is unidentified, the peer review could not conclude on the non relevance of 'D'. With the available relatively uncertain groundwater exposure assessment for 'D' concentrations of 'D' are calculated to be in the range 0.098-0.38 mu g/L with no FOCUS groundwater scenarios having concentrations < 0.1 mu g/L in PEARL simulations and only the Porto Scenario in PELMO simulation giving a concentration just below 0.1 mu g/L. Further information on the identity of unknown 'D' and consequent assessments in relation to groundwater for this use are therefore necessary. For the intended uses of spring applications to spring cereals and linseed, potential for groundwater exposure has not been adequately addressed. The risk to all groups of non-target organisms was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated except for aquatic higher plants. Risk mitigation measures are required to protect aquatic macrophytes in Member States where geoclimatic conditions prevail which are represented by FOCUS scenarios D1 and D2.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenpropidin,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.124r,"Fenpropidin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropidin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 24 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 23 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in January - February 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals full details of the gap can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Tern 750 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate formulation (EC). Fenpropidin is a racemic mixture. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised. Adequate methods are available to monitor fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) in products of plant origin, soil water and air and fenpropidin (and its salts expressed as fenpropidin) and CGA 2892672 in products of animal origin. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is an outstanding data requirement for a sprayability study to address the poor emulsion stability of the formulation. In mammalian toxicity testing, fenpropidin is acutely toxic via ingestion and inhalation (LD50 1452 mg/kg bw and LC50 1.22 mg/L). It is not acutely toxic via dermal route. It is irritant to skin and eyes but not corrosive. It is a skin sensitiser in both the Buehler and Maximization tests. Classification with Xn R20/22 (harmful by inhalation and if swallowed), Xi R38 (irritating to skin), R41 (risk of serious damage to eyes) and R43 (may cause sensitisation by skin contact) is proposed. According to a 28-day inhalation study showing irritating effects to the respiratory system, classification of fenpropidin as R37 (""irritating to the respiratory system"") is warranted. The relevant NOAEL for short term toxicity in rats is 1.14 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in dogs is 2 mg/kg bw/day, based irritative effects and liver effects, respectively. Fenpropidin does not show any potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and potential toxicity. The relevant long term NOAEL is 2.27 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight; maternal and offspring NOAELs are 8 and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 9 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs are 90 and 12 mg/kg bw/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. Fenpropidin showed a neurotoxic potential in the repeated dose studies, expressed as spinal chord demyelination at the maximum doses tested in a 90-day rat and 1-year dog study. The NOAELs were 5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs and 10.1 mg/kg bw/day in rats. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD are 0.02 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100). The operator exposure of fenpropidin in field crop scenario with a tractor mounted hydraulic boom sprayer shows exposure levels below the AOEL when appropriate PPE is worn (gloves during mixing/loading and sturdy footwear and coveralls during application). Workers and bystanders show exposure levels below the AOEL under worst case assessments (67% with PPE and 4.5%, respectively). The metabolic pathway of fenpropidin in cereals has been elucidated. Several routes of metabolism have been identified but the metabolic pattern in wheat grain and straw at plant maturity is clearly dominated by the parent compound. Therefore the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring in cereals is restricted to fenpropidin. Supervised residue trials conducted in Northern Europe support the setting of MRLs of 0.1 mg/kg in wheat, rye and triticale and of 0.3 mg/kg in barley and oats. High residue levels were found in straw. Under processing the nature of fenpropidin residues is not affected and residues are preferentially transferred to bran during the milling process. The transfer factor from barley to beer could not be determined exactly but is below 0.4. A transfer of soil residues to rotational crops after cereal use is not expected. A significant exposure of livestock mainly resulting from consumption of straw is expected. Animal metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens show that fenpropidin is extensively metabolised in livestock and a complex residue pattern is found in edible tissues. The residue definition for monitoring animal commodities consists in the sum of fenpropidin and one of its major animal metabolites (CGA 289267). For risk assessment, further major metabolites need to be considered and conversion factors between both definitions have been proposed. A feeding study in dairy cows has been conducted and can be used for MRL setting in animal products. Chronic and acute consumer exposure assessments were conducted and, under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to, did not show any indication of dietary risk. In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropidin exhibits moderate to high persistence and has the potential to accumulate when used in successive years. When it degrades it forms the major soil metabolite CGA 289267 (accounting for a maximum 10.6% of applied radioactivity (AR) at 8 degrees C) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the benzylic bridge radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 16-32% AR after 90-92 days (22 degrees C). The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 9-19 % AR after 90-92 days. Fenpropidin is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, CGA 289267 exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either fenpropidin or CGA 289267 was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropidin degraded exhibiting moderate to medium persistence to the metabolite CGA 289267 found primarily in the water of the system (maximum 1314% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for 11-60 % AR at 84 days (study end, benzylic bridge radiolabel). Unextracted sediment residues a minor sink representing around 8 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropidin at steps 3 & 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite CGA 289267 appropriate FOCUS step 3 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. There is the potential for short range atmospheric deposition to surface water from fenpropidin that may volatilise at the time of application and from plant surfaces for around 24 hours after application. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropidin and its soil metabolite CGA 289267 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in TERs below the Annex VI trigger for the acute scenario in the Northern European GAP and in the long-term scenarios in the Northern and Southern European GAPs. Measured residue values and the focal skylark (Alauda arvensis) and yellowhammer (Motacilla flava) were agreed by the experts to be used in the refined risk assessment but not the suggested PT values. The acute TER for herbivorous birds was > 10 based on maximum initial measured residues. The meeting agreed to take into account in the long-term risk assessment that cereals would become not attractive as a food source for herbivorous birds and mammals soon after the first application when stem elongation starts. The reduction of residues in insects based on general considerations of growth of insect populations was not accepted since it was not based on measured residues. A more detailed consideration of insect populations in the relevant crop would be required before a scientifically sound and robust estimation of residue decline could be made. The FOCUS based interception factor of 0.5 for residues on weed seeds was rejected since weeds may have a similar or larger height as the crop during early cereal growth stages and extrapolation from deposition on soil surface was considered as not correct. A data gap was identified to refine the longterm risk assessment for herbivorous birds and insectivorous birds (Northern and Southern European uses). The Annex VI trigger was met for insectivorous mammals but breached in the first-tier acute and long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The suggest PT to refine the risk was not sufficiently supported by data and hence rejected. However based on accepted measured residue values the refined risk assessment resulted in TERs above the trigger indicating a low risk from the representative uses evaluated. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low. The acute TERs for exposure to contaminated drinking water based on the 5-fold dilution of the sprayed solution resulted in TERs < 10 for birds. Further information on the drinking behaviour of birds was not submitted leaving some uncertainty via this route of exposure. However the application is to cereals and hence the formation of leaf puddles is unlikely. Algae were the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms driving the aquatic risk assessment. The risk assessment was based on an endpoint from a mesocosm study. The proposed NOEAEC of 6.8 mu g fenpropin/L was not agreed because long-lasting effects on Chlorophyceae were observed at a concentration of 1.4 mu g fenpropidin/L. The meeting agreed on a NOEC of 0.39 mu g fenpropidin/L (based on mean measured initial concentrations). It was suggested by the meeting of experts that an assessment factor of 1-3 should be applied at Member State level depending on the representativeness of the mesocosm to the local environmental conditions in the agricultural landscape. In the updated addendum of September 2007 (not peer-reviewed) the RMS recalculated the TERs based on FOCUS step 4 PECsw. With a no-spray buffer zone of 50 metres the TERs were above 1 in all drainage scenarios out of 6 but below 1 in all run-off scenarios. No full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs > 3. The risk from metabolite CGA 289267 to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. Predatory mites were the most sensititve group of non-target terrestrial arthropods tested. Extended laboratory studies indicated a high in-field risk but also a potential of recolonisation due to rapid residue decline. The available studies did not cover the off-field exposure rates for Phytoseilus persimilis. An in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres is required to achieve a rate low enough to conclude on a low risk to predatory mites based on the available studies. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. The long-term TER for the Northern European use was calculated as 4.6. Since the TER value is not far below the trigger of 5 and the TER is based on very conservative PECsoil calculations (accumulation for 20 years) the experts agreed that the longterm risk to earthworms is low. The risk from the major soil metabolite CGA 289267 was assessed as low. The risk to bees, other soil non-target macro-organisms (collembola), soil non-target microorganisms, biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance nicosulfuron,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.120r,"Nicosulfuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/ 20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on nicosulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/ 2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 12 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISK Biosciences Europe S. A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in February - March 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 26 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to control perennial grass weed species and a range of annual grass weed and broad-leaved weed species in grain and fodder maize up to the BBCH 12-18 leaf stage, in Northern and Southern Europe, at a single application at a maximum rate of 60 g as/ ha. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""SL-950 4% SC"", an oil dispersion (OD), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor nicosulfuron residues in grain and fodder maize, soil water and air. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Nicosulfuron is absorbed rapidly but only to a limited extent (about 40%) in the rat following oral administration. It is widely and uniformly distributed in the body and is excreted largely unchanged via bile and urine. The compound is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal, inhalational and intraperitoneal route. It is non-irritant to skin, slightly irritant to the eye and showed weak sensitisation potential in a Guinea pig maximisation test. Nicosulfuron was of low toxicity also in the short term studies in rat, mouse and dog, showing mild hepatotoxicity in the rat at very high dose levels. No genotoxicity was observed in vitro and in vivo, and no evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in the rat. Increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma were seen in male mice at the top dose level but not considered to be of relevance to the risk assessment. No effects on reproduction were seen in a two-generation study with rats. No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit. There is no proposal for a classification for effects on human health. None of the groundwater metabolites (ASDM, ADMP, AUSN, UCSN, MU466, HMUD) was considered to be relevant according to the current EU guidance document on relevance of metabolites. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 2 mg/kg bw/day, derived from a chronic rat study, and applying a safety factor of 100. Subchronic dog studies (28-day, 90-day and 1-year) support this value. Due to the low acute toxicity of nicosulfuron, it was agreed that an acute reference dose (ARfD) is not required. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.8 mg/kg bw/day, based on the subchronic dog studies applying a safety factor of 100 and correcting for oral absorption of 40%. The exposure estimates for operators were 4% and 27% of the AOEL wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) with the German model, and with the UK POEM respectively. When no PPE is worn values rise to 10% and 39% respectively. Estimated exposures both for bystanders and re-entry workers were estimated to be well below the AOEL. Metabolism of nicosulfuron was studied in maize. A few hours after application to the plants, a considerable amount of metabolism had already occurred. Nevertheless, 60 days after application nicosulfuron was still the most significant residue (41-52% TRR). Major metabolites identified were AUSN and ASDM (individually around 20% TRR), indicating that a cleavage of the ring structures had occurred. At harvest (102 days after application) the residue profile was very similar to that observed at the 60 days interval. The total residue upon application according to the notified GAP was very low and no significant residues of nicosulfuron or its metabolites are expected in maize at harvest. This was confirmed by the results of supervised residue trials. Also in following crops no significant residue levels are expected, since due to phytotoxic effects other crops than cereals could not be grown until nicosulfuron and metabolites have decreased to <0.001 mg/kg in the soil. No significant uptake of residues from soil was found in the cereal crops analysed for total residues in lysimeter studies. Therefore it was concluded that based on the data submitted to support the use in maize, the residue definition in this crop could be limited to nicosulfuron for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. Intakes of nicosulfuron by domestic animals will not be significant and livestock studies were not necessary. Some data is available for future reference, however at this time it is not possible to propose residue definitions in animal products. In a chronic consumer risk assessment all residue intakes from maize were significantly less than 1 % of the ADI and it can therefore be concluded that the chronic risk to the consumer is low. The consumer may be also exposed to soil metabolites leaching into ground water used as drinking water but the additional exposure from this source does most likely not exceed 0.05% of the ADI of nicosulfuron. An acute risk assessment was not necessary as nicosulfuron has been shown to have a very low acute toxicity profile and no ARfD was allocated to this substance. In soil under aerobic conditions nicosulfuron exhibits very low to low persistence. Degradation produced five metabolites, the maximum amounts seen in the route of degradation studies were: 14.4% AR for HMUD, 7.2% AR for ADMP, 21.5% AR for ASDM, 26.8% AR for AUSN and 11% AR for UCSN. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for a maximum of 16.8 % AR after 112 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink accounting for 35.2-45.9 % AR after 112 days. Under anaerobic soil conditions degradation was slower than under aerobic conditions but no novel breakdown products were identified. Aerobic degradation studies with metabolites indicated that ADMP is low to moderate persistent, HMUD is moderate persistent, AUSN and ASDM are medium to high persistent and UCSN is high persistent in soil. Degradation of nicosulfuron is not considered dependent on the pH conditions of the soil. Nicosulfuron and ADMP exhibit high to very high mobility in soil, HMUD, AUSN, UCSN, ASDM and MU-466 (a metabolite identified in the lysimeter studies) exhibit very high mobility. Chemical hydrolysis may contribute to the overall degradation of nicosulfuron in acidic water, but it is unlikely to be a significant route of degradation under neutral or alkaline conditions. Aqueous photolysis is not expected to be a major route of dissipation in surface water. In a dark sediment/water study, nicosulfuron was predominantly found in the water phase, with partitioning to sediment being relatively low (maximum 18-24% AR at 14d). One major metabolite (HMUD) and three minor metabolites (AUSN, UCSN and ASDM) were present in both the water and sediment phases, although their concentrations were generally lower in the sediment phase. Mineralisation reached a maximum of 1.4% AR. The PEC for surface water and sediment for nicosulfuron used a FOCUS Step 4 assessment with a 5 metre buffer zone. Step 1 and Step 2 calculations were performed for metabolites HMUD, AUSN, UCSN and ASDM. The PEC groundwater used FOCUS PELMO and this model produced one scenario where nicosulfuron is predicted to be above 0.1 mu g/L. ADMP and MU- 466 were not predicted to be exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in any scenario. AUSN, UCSN and ASDM are predicted to be above 0.75 mu g/L in 6 out of 8 scenarios, but less than 2.5 mu g/L and HMUD is predicted to be above 0.1 mu g/L in five scenarios but all are less than 0.75 mu g/L. On the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data, it was concluded that none of the groundwater metabolites was considered to be relevant according to the current EU guidance document on relevance of metabolites. Nicosulfuron is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and potential for long range transport may be considered negligible. The risk to all groups of non-target organisms was assessed as low for the representative use of nicosulfuron in maize except for aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial non-target plants. Lemna gibba was the most sensitive aquatic organism tested. A no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres is required achieve a TER of > 10 in the 4 FOCUS step4 drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D5, D6) but only in one run-off part scenario (R1 pond) out of 4 run-off scenarios the TER was > 10. No-spray buffer zones are not sufficient as a risk mitigation measure under geoclimatic conditions where run-off is the dominant route of entry into surface water and further risk mitigation measures have to be considered at Member States level. 23 different plant species (predominantly dicotyl and monocotyl crop species) was tested. In the original risk assessment it was suggested to use the lowest endpoint and to reduce the safety factor from 5 to 1. The trigger of 1 was exceeded if an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres is applied. The original risk assessment was not accepted in the peer-review and it was suggested to use an HC5 approach as outlined in the terrestrial guidance document. Such a risk assessment was submitted by the applicant and assessed by the RMS in a not peer-reviewed addendum 4 from July 2007. The HC5 is similar to the lowest endpoint and hence also requiring a 5 meter in-field no-spray buffer zone to mitigate the risk to non-target plants in the off-field area.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.122r,"Diflufenican is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diflufenican in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 1 August 2005. The peer review was initiated on 3 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as pre- and post emergence herbicide as proposed by the main notifier, which comprises spraying applications, up to crop growth stage BBCH 10-13, to control annual broad-leaved weeds and annual grasses in winter wheat, winter barley and winter rye at a single application at a maximum rate of 120 g diflufenican/ha. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Herold SC 600"", an aqueous suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names containing diflufenican and flufenacet. The main notifier submitted two representative uses and formulations, however the RMS and the main notifier agreed to evaluate only ""Herold SC 600"". Adequate methods are available to monitor diflufenican residues in plants, foodstuff of plant and animal origin, soil, water and air. Residues in food of plant and animal origin can be determined with the German multi-residue method DFG S19. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of diflufenican. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Concerning the mammalian toxicology assessment, diflufenican has a low acute toxicity, is not irritant and has no skin sensitisation potential. In repeat dose studies, the main adverse effects were on the body weight gain and in the liver. No concern was raised about the genotoxic properties of diflufenican, and no carcinogenic potential was demonstrated. In the multigeneration study, incidences of dystocia were observed at the high dose but were concomitant with systemic toxicity and did not lead to classification. No teratogenic activity was shown in the developmental studies. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.2 mg/kg bw/day and the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.11 mg/kg bw/day, both with the use of a safety factor 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not required. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The metabolism of diflufenican was investigated in wheat upon pre- and post-emergence application. The application rate and timing used in the plant metabolism study correspond to the notified GAP criteria. In the wheat grains, diflufenican could be detected but an extensive identification of metabolites was difficult due to the low residue levels. In straw, again diflufenican was identified; however the major part of the total residue consisted of different metabolites that, with one exception, were not identified since individually not present above the trigger value of 0.01 mg/kg. The meeting of experts noted that for future cereal uses that deviate from the assessed GAP additional metabolism data may be required in order to refine the residues definition, currently proposed as diflufenican. The metabolism and distribution of diflufenican in rotational crops was investigated in wheat, cabbage and sugar beet. Two metabolites, AE 0542291(2) and AE B107137(3) could be identified since they presented a substantial part of the total residue in the tested crops. Eventually, the two metabolites were not considered to be of concern for the consumer. The experts concluded that for the particular notified use and GAP it is not expected to get residue levels in rotational crops exceeding the trigger value of 0.01 mg/kg. A very limited number of residue trials support the notified GAP. In addition, residue trials are available with an increased latest time of application, and it was proposed to use these trials to support the notified GAP. The data allow for an MRL proposal for cereal grains on LOQ level. Based on the residue trial data livestock exposure is possible through straw used in animal diet, in particular in ruminant diet. No exposure of poultry is expected. However, the metabolism and distribution in animals was investigated in lactating cows and chickens. As for the assessed representative use it was concluded that no residues of diflufenican above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are likely to occur in edible animal matrices and thus no feeding studies and no MRLs for animal products are considered necessary. The chronic dietary risk assessment for consumers showed that exposure to residues of diflufenican from the notified use is well below the allocated ADI. As no ARfD was derived an acute risk assessment is not required. Under dark aerobic conditions at 20 - 22 degrees C, diflufenican was moderate to high persistent in soil. Two major soil aerobic metabolites were identified, AE 0542291 and AE B107137 that are moderately persistent in soil. Mineralization was from 3.85 % AR after 120 d to a maximum of 51.2 % AR after 52 d depending on the study and the labelling position. Unextractable residues range from 3.04 % AR after 120 d to 18.5 % AR after 54 d depending on the study and the labelling position. Diflufenican is medium to very high persistent under anaerobic conditions. Volatile transformation product 2,4-difluroaniline (AE C522392) was identified as a major anaerobic metabolite. Degradation of AE B107137 was also investigated under anaerobic conditions. Diflufenican is shown to be stable to the photolysis in soil. Field studies in six German sites and six sites in different European locations (UK, FR, DE, NL, ES and IT) show that diflufenican was high to very high persistent under field conditions. A kinetic analysis of the two field studies to obtain field normalized half lives is also available. In a five years accumulation study conducted at six sites in south-east England (Maycey and Savage, 1991a) a clear tendency to accumulation of diflufenican residues was observed. Since soil concentration derived from the field accumulation study was higher than the obtained from standard calculation this value was used for the ecotoxicological risk assessment and the calculation of the potential maximum concentration of the metabolites. Diflufenican is slight mobile to immobile in soil, AE B107137 is very highly mobile and AE 0542291 is medium to highly mobile. Diflufenican and its metabolite AE B107137 were stable to hydrolysis. Diflufenican was also stable to aqueous photolysis and non ready biodegradable. Degradation of diflufenican in dark water sediment was investigated in a total of four systems. The application rate used in these studies is significantly above of the solubility limit. Diflufenican was medium to very high persistent in these systems and was slowly transformed to the metabolite AE B107137. In all the water sediment systems available mineralization was negligible (< 4 % A R after 120 d). Data from these studies were analyzed in a separated study by multicompartmental kinetic models. Whereas these fitting exercises are able to describe the system as a whole the individual degradation rates for the water phase should be taken with caution. The values obtained from this kinetic analysis were employed in the FOCUS SW modelling presented in the DAR. In a sediment monitoring study performed in UK winter cereal areas with history of repeated use of diflufenican at rates below 100 g / ha variable results were obtained. Different FOCUS PECSW/SED are available in the DAR and in the Addendum, none of them produced with the input parameters agreed by the expert's meeting. However, the expert's meeting decided to retain the PECSW / SED values presented in the DAR for the EU risk assessment. Examination of the modelling results and the ecotoxicological risk assessment showed that Step 4 calculation with a 5 m buffer for spray drift only resulted in a complete scenario with acceptable TERs for aquatic risk assessment (D3). After the expert meeting, EFSA identified a data GAP for new FOCUS PECSW calculations using a plant uptake factor of zero and the input parameters agree for the meeting (mean whole systems half life for SW and 1000 d for sediment, with only spray drift buffer strip mitigation in order to confirm the proposed risk assessment and to make it consistent with the risk assessments performed for other substances of this peer review phase. Potential ground water contamination by diflufenican and the soil metabolites AE B107137 and AE 0542291 was evaluated by FOCUS PELMO (v. 3.3.2). The 80th percentile annual average concentrations in leachates below 1 m were predicted to be less than 0.001 mu g/L for all compounds in the nine European scenarios. Diflufenican may be considered slightly volatile. However, based on the negligible potential for volatilization from plant and soil surface it is considered that exposure to air and therefore long range transport thought air is insignificant for diflufenican. During expert's meeting soil anaerobic metabolite 2,4-difluroaniline was found to be very volatile and may need to be assessed for the air compartment and for transport through air when anaerobic conditions are expected to occur. The Annex VI triggers were met in the acute and long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals taking into consideration only exposure to diflufenican. However the lead formulation Herold SC 600 contains flufenacet as a second active substance. The toxicity and exposure to the second active substance was not taken into account in the risk assessment. The long-term TER for herbivorous mammals of 5.3 is close to the trigger of 5. It is likely that the TER would be below the trigger if exposure to the second active substance is considered in the risk assessment. A risk assessment taking into consideration also exposure to flufenacet is required before a conclusion can be drawn on the risk to birds and mammals from the representative use of diflufenican formulated as Herold SC 600. Green algae were the most sensitive organisms driving the aquatic risk assessment. Only the FOCUS step4 part scenario D5 pond reached a TER of > 10 including a no-spray buffer zone of 5 metres indicating a high risk to aquatic organisms for the majority of geoclimatic conditions in Europe presented by the FOCUS scenarios. However the risk to aquatic organisms is addressed for the full FOCUS step 4 scenario D3 (ditch) if the approach is followed which was agreed in the meeting of experts on ecotoxicology. It may be possible to identify further scenarios with acceptable risk if recovery is taken into account as suggested in the addendum from April 2007 or if larger no-spray buffer zones are introduced in the PECsw calculations. The RMS stated in the not peer-reviewed addendum from August 2007 that a new risk assessment was submitted by the applicant but the risk assessment was not summarised and evaluated in the addendum. The aquatic risk assessment was based on exposure to diflufenican alone. However tests with the formulation Herold SC 600 suggest lower toxicity to green algae (the most sensitive group of aquatic organisms tested) compared to technical diflufenican. Therefore it was agreed in the expert meeting that the risk from the formulation would be covered by the risk assessment for diflufenican. The in-field and off-field HQ values for Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri were below the trigger of 2 based on studies with formulations different from Herold SC 600. Studies with the formulation Herold SC 600 indicated a high risk to T. pyri. No studies with the lead formulation and non-target arthropods other than T. pyri were made available. The risk to non-target arthropods was not sufficiently addressed for the suggested representative use. Consequently a data gap was identified by the experts to address the risk to non-target arthropods from the formulation Herold SC 600. The risk to non-target plants from pre-emergence and post-emergence exposure to diflufenican was assessed as high and risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 10 meters is required. The risk to bees, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.119r,"Bifenox is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 25 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Feinchemie Schwebda. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 25 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant on winter wheat and barley, full details of the gap can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Milan"", a suspension concentrate (SC), the formulation also contains another active substance pyraflufen-ethyl. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition where these could be set. Residues in cereals can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bifenox in soil and air and bifenox and aminobifenox acid(2) in water. The ground water residue definition is not finalised and further methods for bifenox acid may be required. Also it is not yet clear if methods will be required for products of animal origin. Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The technical specification can not be agreed on at this time as the analytical data do not support the proposed values. In mammalian metabolism studies oral absorption of bifenox occurred in the first 48 hours after dosing and is sex and dose dependent. Bioavailability reached 29% and 53% in male and female rats respectively, after a single oral low dose. When the dose was increased, urinary excretion was reduced suggesting saturation of absorption. Based on urinary excretion, oral absorption is estimated to be 25%. No potential for accumulation was observed. Metabolism occurred by nitro-reduction and O-demethylation. Acute oral toxicity of bifenox is low in rats, however, classification with Xn, R22-Harmful if swallowed, is required based on the oral LD50 found in mice (1540 and 1780 mg/kg bw in males and females respectively). No classification is required for dermal or inhalation toxicity; bifenox is not a skin or eye irritant and is not a skin sensitizer. Animals exposed to bifenox developed mild signs of porphyria as suggested by small-altered blood parameters (in rats and dogs), kidney toxicity (rat), and some altered clinical chemistry, which could suggest hepatotoxicity (rat and dog). Bifenox showed no potential for genotoxicity. Upon long-term exposure, no clear toxic effects were demonstrated in either rats or mice, which was found a limitation factor by the experts of PRAPeR 19 to conclude on the carcinogenic potential of bifenox; according to the available results, no carcinogenic potential was observed. Bifenox produced no adverse effects on fertility, slight/marginal effects on reproduction/development were observed at parental toxic doses, and no teratogenic effects were seen. No potential for neurotoxicity was evidenced. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) at 0.5 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.125 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 400 (correction of 25% for oral absorption). Dermal absorption was 1% when handling the concentrate representative formulation ( Milan) and 4% when handling an in-use field dilution. According to the representative uses of Milan, and considering only the bifenox component of the formulation, the estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves during mixing/loading and application are used according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure was below the AOEL even without the use of PPE. Exposure of workers and bystanders was estimated to be also below the AOEL. The metabolism of bifenox was investigated in winter wheat. Upon an early application (BBCH 13) bifenox was extensively and completely metabolised through hydroxylation into bifenox acid(3) and the major metabolite hydroxybifenox acid(4) followed by conjugation with glucose. Identification of metabolites was based on residues in straw as the residues in grains were very low. The results of supervised residue trials indicated that, when bifenox is applied at a later growth stage (BBCH 29), unchanged bifenox is still a significant residue in straw. As the notified GAP allows for applications between BBCH 13 and 29, a significant variation in the composition of the residues may occur. Hydroxybifenox acid was not found in the rat and therefore it could not be concluded whether it needs to be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. The experts of PRAPeR 20 concluded that the levels of hydroxybifenox acid residues that could be expected in cereal crops having received an early application were not sufficiently addressed by residue trial data and further trials are needed. In a rotational crop study significant residue levels were found in edible crops parts. However, the study had some draw backs that didn't allow finalising the assessment of whether these residues are relevant for consumer and livestock exposure and therefore further data are required. Significant residue may also occur in the diet of ruminants; however no livestock metabolism data were submitted that would address the nature of potentially occurring residues in food of animal origin. In an available feeding study with goats, only milk was analysed for residues of bifenox, but residue levels and the potential of accumulation in tissues and organs was not investigated. Bifenox is considered a fat soluble compound. Therefore further data are required to address residues in food of animal origin. The consumer dietary intake and risk assessment cannot be finalised pending data submission to address the identified data gaps. While the consumer exposure to residues of bifenox in grains (all below the LOQ) is expected to be insignificant (< 1% of the ADI and ARfD respectively), the exposure to residues in food of animal origin and rotated crops cannot be assessed due to lack of data. In soil under aerobic conditions bifenox exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolite bifenox acid (accounting for up to 79% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and nitrophenyl rings to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 3.8-8% AR after 90-92 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 28-41 % AR after 90-92 days. Bifenox is immobile or exhibits low mobility in soil, bifenox acid exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenox or bifenox acid was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems bifenox degraded exhibiting low persistence in both water and sediment to the metabolite aminobifenox(5) in sediment which exhibited moderate persistence and to aminobifenox acid in water. In mesocosm studies (light exposed) low levels of 2,4-dichlorophenol were produced which exhibited low persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.9 % AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 60-64 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenox at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites aminobifenox, aminobifenox acid, 2,4-dichlorophenol and [ bifenox acid that may leach from soil to surface water] appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by bifenox above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolite bifenox acid, in geoclimatic regions represented by the Okehampton and Piacenza FOCUS groundwater scenarios contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit cannot be excluded and a metabolite non relevance assessment was triggered for this metabolite. The conclusion of this assessment using the available toxicological information was that bifenox acid was not relevant with respect to groundwater. However information on pesticidal activity of bifenox acid against target weeds is required before the groundwater non relevance assessment can be finalised. The acute and long-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals were assessed as low in the first tier-risk assessment. The long-term risk to mammals needed refinement. The suggested refinement based on wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) as a focal species and the PD and measured residues were accepted by the meeting of experts but not the suggested PT values. The long-term TER of 5 is not met without PT refinement. Therefore, a data gap for submission of further data to refine the risk was identified in the experts' meeting. Bifenox is very toxic to aquatic organisms with algae driving the risk assessment. No TER met the Annex VI trigger based on FOCUS step3 PECsw. A mesocosm study was submitted. A NOAEC of 4 mu g bifenox/L and a safety factor of 2-3 was agreed in the meeting of experts. Risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 10 m is required to achieve a TER of > 3 and a no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to achieve TERs > 2 for all FOCUS step4 scenarios. A range of non-target arthropods was tested. Typhlodromus pyri reacted very sensitive in the standard glass-plate test. In an extended laboratory study it was shown that adverse effects in the off-field area are <50%. Hence the risk to predatory mites was considered to be sufficiently addressed. A long-term/reproduction study with bifenox and earthworms was not considered necessary since the DT90 values were in the range of 28-107 days and only one application per year is proposed. However a chronic study with another formulation containing additionally two other active substances was submitted by the applicant. No effects were observed at the highest tested application rate which is about 5 times the suggested field rate. No long-term/reproduction study with earthworms was submitted for the metabolite bifenox acid for which DT90 values ranged from 80-517 days. It is very likely that bifenox-acid was formed in the long-term test with the formulation but it is uncertain if it reached amounts comparable to the PECsoil. Taking into account that no effects were observed in the long-term study at an application rate of up to 5 times the suggested field rate and that no acute effects were observed in the study with bifenox-acid no further studies with earthworms are considered necessary. No studies with bifenox and other soil non-target micro-organisms were triggered. The need for studies with bifenox-acid was discussed in the experts' meeting. It was agreed that no study is required if the long-term risk to earthworms is sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.",NA

In the course of the revision it became apparent that the task embraced several risk management issues that are not within EFSA's and the PPR Panel's remit. Therefore, the PPR Panel has adopted a two-stage approach and first has prepared the present 'Scientific Opinion on the Science behind the Guidance Document (GD) on risk assessment for birds and mammals' using a modular approach. In the second stage, a joint working group of representatives from EFSA, the European Commission and Member States will consider the risk management issues and finalise the revised/new Guidance Document. However, this opinion will remain unchanged and hence be a reference document giving the full scientific background to the risk assessment for birds and mammals. The opinion addresses approaches to risk assessment for birds and mammals. In both cases, a tiered approach is used to assess the risk of mortality and reproductive effects. The PPR Panel has developed a first-tier assessment procedure for a large range of scenarios including different crops and different types of pesticide uses (e.g. granules, seed treatment, and sprays). Each scenario is a combination of the ecological characteristics of exposed species and other factors relevant to exposure, e.g. the type and structure of crop, and the type of formulation of the pesticide product. The Panel has used the best available data to define each scenario. In most cases the assessment results in a toxicity-exposure-ratio (TER) as a measure of risk. However, in the case of acute risks to birds from sprayed pesticides, the PPR Panel has also offered an alternative approach based on the number of lethal doses applied per square meter (LD50/m(2)). The PPR Panel evaluated the level of protection provided by each first-tier procedure, taking account of the conservatism of the assumptions used, uncertainties arising from factors omitted from the assessment (e.g. dermal exposure) and, where available, evidence on actual effects in field studies or from incident monitoring. The PPR Panel provides guidance on the range of options available for higher-tier risk assessment, e.g. refined dietary exposure assessments using realistic data on the ecology of relevant species; or field studies in order to get better residue data, better ecological data, or to measure effects. The PPR Panel also presents guidance on how to combine different types of evidence from higher-tier risk assessment to form an overall judgement on the level of risk, giving appropriate weight to the strengths and uncertainties of each type of evidence. More detailed guidance on specific aspects of higher risk assessment is given in a series of Appendices to the opinion. Further Appendices provide detailed scientific background and underlying data for the first-tier assessment procedures. The Panel has also submitted worked examples for the reproductive risk assessment and compared the outcome of the proposed new assessment procedures with the existing risk assessment scheme.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metazachlor,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.145r,"Metazachlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metazachlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 30 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 6 October 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the two applicants BASF and Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in July August 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November December 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide on winter and spring oilseed rape and ornamentals for the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Butisan S"" (BASF) and ""Fuego"" (MAK), both suspension concentrates (SC) containing 500 g/1 metazachlor. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices, however subject to the final agreement on the hazard classification of metazachlor, additional analytical methods for groundwater monitoring would be required. As for mammalian toxicology, metazachlor acute toxicity is low via oral, dermal and inhalation routes (LD50>2000 mg/kg and LC50>34.5 mg/1). Metazachlor is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. Metazachlor was proposed to be classified as skin sensitiser R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The relevant NOAELs for subacute and subchronic exposure in rats are 110 mg/kg bw/day and 21 mg/kg bw/day (BASF and FSG, LOAELs 330 and 137 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Metazachlor did not show any genotoxic potential. Liver adenomas and thyroid tumours occurred in the rat, while the mouse showed slight increases in bladder transitional cell tumours at high dose levels. Since there was no genotoxicity and clear no effect levels for tumour development were seen in all tests, it was apparent that tumour development could be considered to involve a threshold mechanism. A classification as Care. Cat. 3 R40 (""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") was proposed. The parental NOAEL for the BASF study (limited validity) is 1000 ppm as well as the reproductive and the offspring NOAELs. The parental and the reproductive NOAELs of the FSG study are 151 and 192 mg/kg bw/day (2000 ppm), respectively. For the offspring the NOAEL is 20 mg/kg bw/day (200 ppm) based on reduced pup weight and survival in the F3 generation. No evidence of teratogenicity was seen in developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit. The relevant maternal NOAELs are 50 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbit (BASF) and 30 and 250 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit and rat, respectively (FSG); the relevant developmental NOAELs are 250 and 450 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit and rat, respectively (BASF) and 120 and 250 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit and rat, respectively (FSG). Metazachlor did not show any potential for acute, repeated dose or delayed neurotoxicity. An ADI of 0.08 mg/kg bw/day was derived for metazachlor, based on the NOAEL of 8.5 mg/kg bw/day; an ARfD of 0.5 mg/kg bw was derived, based on the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the developmental study in rats, and the AOEL was set at 0.2 mg/kg bw/day, based on the relevant short term toxicity NOAEL 21 mg/kg bw/day in rat. The safety factor applied is 100. The operator exposure is below the AOEL for Butisan only with the use of gloves when handling the concentrate, coveralls and gloves during application (German model); for Fuego the exposure is below the AOEL even without PPE for field application estimated with the German model, with use of gloves during mixing/loading (tractor application, UK POEM) and with the use of gloves when handling the concentrate, coveralls and gloves during application (knapsack spraying, UK POEM). The re-entry exposure is estimated to be above the AOEL for both Butisan and below the AOEL for Fuego. Bystander exposure is below the AOEL for both plant protection products. The metabolism of metazachlor in plant and livestock is extensive and the parent compound does not participate to the toxicological burden the consumer is exposed to. The residue definition for monitoring is proposed to include all residual compounds containing the 2,6-dimethylaniline moiety. For monitoring of plant products, 3 metabolites have been identified as valid indicator compounds: metabolites 479M04, 479M08 and 479M16. A possible transfer of soil residues to rotational crops has been identified, but under usual rotation practices with rape seed no measurable residue level above the analytical limit of quantification is expected in food commodities from rotational crops. There is a low exposure of livestock to residues present in feeding stuff but their transfer to edible animal commodities is not expected to reach analytically measurable levels. No risk for the consumer has been identified resulting from short or long term dietary exposure to residues in food commodities and to metabolites contaminating groundwater resulting from the representative use of metazachlor in rape seed. The available data on the aerobic degradation in soil indicated that the metabolic pathway of metazachlor under aerobic conditions is complex. Two metabolites were found in soil at concentrations of greater than 10% applied radioactivity (AR), these were the metazachlor acid 479M04 (max. 16.2% AR at 91d) and the sulfonic acid derivative 479M08 (max. 21.6 at 181d). Two further metabolites, 479M09 and 479M11 were detected in smaller amounts, with 479M11 measured at levels > 5% AR on 3 consecutive time points. All metabolites identified contained both ring systems, (both the phenyl and the pyrazol rings). Cleavage of either of the ring systems is not a significant route of breakdown. Under anaerobic conditions, also 479M06 occurred in amounts greater than 10% AR. But it appeared in higher amounts only after longer incubation times under anaerobic conditions and therefore not considered to be of environmental relevance. Metazachlor degraded in soil under laboratory conditions fast with a mean first order DT50 value of 10.8 days (at 20 C and pF2) and under field conditions even faster, with a geometric mean value of 6.8 days (normalised to 20 degrees C). The degradation rates (first order DT5 degrees arc, pF2) of the major soil metabolites 479M04 and 479M08 in soil under laboratory conditions were 89.9 days and 123.2 day, respectively. Under field conditions the geometric mean value of the DT50 200c was 56.4 days for 479M04 and 71.1 days for 479M08. Metazachlor is adsorbing moderately to soil with Kfoc values between 53.8 and 220 mL/g. The adsorption of the metabolites 479M04, 479M06 and 479M08 is even weaker (Kfoc 1-94 mL/g, 44-62 mL/g and 4-78.5 mL/g, respectively). Therefore, lysimeter studies with metazachlor were performed on oilseed rape. There was no substantial leaching of metazachlor to groundwater. However, some metabolites were found in the lysimeter leachates, the most important were 479M04 (max annual average concentrations 6.33-21.39 g/L) and 479M08 (max concentrations in 2 leachate samples: 5.8-12 g/L). These results were confirmed by the results of FOCUS groundwater modelling. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent metazachlor is concluded to be low. As for 479M04 and 479M08, FOCUS modelling results indicated that these metabolites are expected to exceed 0.75 mu g/L in all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios where it is defined that oilseed rape is grown. For soil metabolites 479M09, 479M11 and 479M12 the PECgw values could not be calculated using the FOCUS groundwater models. The PECgw, values were instead estimated for these metabolites on the basis of transfer factors derived from the comparison of simulated and measured concentrations of the metabolites BH479-4 and BH479-8, for which lysimeter and modelling results are available. Estimated PECgw values for FOCUS scenarios were in the range 0.31-1.72 mu g/L, 0.24-1.30 mu g/L and 0.34-1.88 mu g/L for BH479-9, BH479-11 and BH479-12 respectively. The classification as Carc. Cat. 3 R40 (""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") proposed by the expert meeting on mammalian toxicology has implications for the relevance of the metabolites with the potential to contaminate groundwater. Should the proposed classification of the parent, Carc. Cat.3 R40 be confirmed in the context of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) programme for classification and labelling under Directive 67/548/EEC this would, in line, with the guidance document on groundwater metabolites, require that, for those metabolites with the potential to contaminate groundwater, convincing evidence must be provided that the metabolites will not lead to the risk of carcinogenicity. Metazachlor is hydrolytically stable at pH 5, pH 7 and pH 9. It is also photolytically stable under the influence of light and it is not readily biodegradable. In water/sediment studies metazachlor disappeared from the water phase relatively rapidly and reached moderate (10.9-19.8% AR after 3-15 days) amounts in the sediment. The most significant metabolites identified were 479M04 (7.33-8.41% AR in water and 1.6-2.8% AR in sediment at 99 days) and 479M06 (ca. 8% AR in water and 5.1-8.0% AR in sediment extracts at 99d). The mineralisation rate was very low and the amount of bound residues high with values up to 67% AR at the end of the study (day 99). Metazachlor decreased in aerobic water sediment systems with first order DissT(5o) values from 13.4 to 27.8 days for the whole system. DT50 for the water phase was in the range 48.8-384 days, and DT50 for the sediment dissipation 3.0-6.8 days. The aquatic exposure assessments available are sufficient to complete the necessary EU level estimated of Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) in surface water bodies for the representative uses applied for, for annex I listing. The volatility of metazachlor from aqueous system/soil water is likely to be low. Losses from plant surfaces are also low. The small proportion lost to the upper atmosphere is expected to degrade relatively rapidly (DT(50)air = 6.5 hours derived by the Atkinson method of calculation assuming a hydroxyl radical concentrations of 5x105 radicals/cm(3)). Metazachlor is therefore unlikely to be subject to long range transport. The acute and long-term TERs were above the Annex VI trigger for the acute and short-term risk to birds for all standard scenarios. However the long-term TERs were below the trigger. The suggested refinements were accepted by the experts for the uses of Butisan in oilseed rape. A data gap for further refinement of the risk to insectivorous birds was identified for the use of Fuego in ornamental trees and shrubs. The risk to mammals was assessed as low for the use of Butisan. The long-term TER for herbivorous mammals was below the trigger of 5 for the use of Fuego in ornamentals and a data requirement to refine the risk to herbivorous mammals was identified by the RMS and confirmed by the experts. Algae and higher aquatic plants were the most sensitive groups of organisms tested and a potential high risk to primary producers was indicated in the lower tier risk assessment. Refined risk assessments based on species sensitivity distribution (SSD) and mesocosm endpoints were presented by the applicants. A new risk assessment based on the geometric mean (113.6 jug a.s./L) was submitted by BASF. It was noted in the expert meeting that the tested emergent plants were less sensitive than the submerged plants and hence should not be combined in the SSD or geomean calculation. Based on the endpoints of the 4 submerged plants the geometric mean toxicity value is 40 mu g a.s./L. The number of endpoints (4 submerged species) was considered not sufficient to derive a robust HC5 estimation. Some Member States use a safety factor of 4 in combination with the lower limit HC5. The experts suggested to use the endpoint of 1.67 mu g a.s./L from the mesocosm study (NOAEC of 5 mu g a.s./L with a safety factor of 3) in the risk assessment. A FOCUS step 4 TER calculation was presented for the use of Fuego (0.75 kg a.s./ha). The full FOCUS step 4 scenarios D1, D3, D4, D5 and the part scenario R1 (pond) resulted in a TER above the trigger if a no spray buffer zone of 5 metres was applied. The trigger was not met in the full scenarios D2, R3 and the part scenario R1 (stream). No TER calculations were presented with FOCUSstep 4 PECsw for the use of Butisan (1 kg a.s./ha). However if the regulatory endpoint of 1.67 mu g a.s./L is compared to the FOCUS step 4 PECsw including a no-spray buffer zone of 10 metres than the trigger would be met in all scenarios except D2 and R3 (full scenarios). It is assumed that the use in ornamental trees and shrubs would not lead to higher concentrations of metazachlor in the aquatic environment and hence the risk assessment for oilseed rape covers also the risk from the use in ornamental trees and shrubs. The risk to aquatic organism from the metabolites 479M04, 479M06, 479M08, 479M09, 479M11, 479M12 was assessed as low. The acute and long-term TER values for earthworms were above the trigger for metazachlor and the metabolite 479M04. The long-term TER of 4.8 for metabolite 479M08 was below the trigger of 5. The NOEC used in the TER calculation was based on the highest concentration tested. Therefore the risk to earthworms was considered as addressed. Effects on reproduction of springtails (Folsomia candida) were tested with the two major soil metabolites 479M04, 479M08) and metazachlor formulated as ""Fuego"". The TERs based on PECs from application of 1 kg metazachlor/ha in oilseed rape were markedly above the trigger of 5 indicating a low risk to other soil non-target macro-organisms. Since the DT9O( of 479M04 (BH479-4) and 479M08 (BH479-8) is >365 days a litter-bag study is triggered. No effects were observed in the litter bag study submitted by BASF. The concentrations were lower than the calculated accumulated peak PECsoil values. However the effect on soil micro organisms was <25%, the TERlt for earthworms was >5 (except for the endpoint for 479M08 from a study of MAK-FSG) and the studies with Folsomia candida gave an indication that the risk to soil dwelling arthropods is low. Therefore it was concluded that the risk to soil dwelling macro-organisms and organic matter breakdown is low for the representative uses of metazachlor. TERs for non-target plants based on the endpoints from glasshouse trials were below the trigger of 5. The TER is 6.05 if a no-spray buffer zone of 10 m is applied. Using the test results from the field trials then the TER is >5 for the pre-emergent exposure at 1 m distance from the treated field and the no -spray buffer zone can be reduced to 5m to achieve TERs above 5 for post-emergent exposure. In the studies with the formulation ""Fuego"" the lowest endpoints were observed for oat and sugar beet. The TERs were above the trigger of 5 for pre emergent exposure at the standard distance of lm but for the post -emergence exposure a no -spray buffer zone of 5m is required to achieve a TER > 5. The risk to non -target plants from the use in ornamental trees and shrubs is considered as covered by the risk assessment for oilseed rape. No higher drift rates are expected from the use in ornamental since the product is sprayed to reach weeds under the ornamental trees. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tralkoxydim,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.139r,"Tralkoxydim is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1).

The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tralkoxydim in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 3 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May June 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses for Southern Member States as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises spraying applications, to control grass weeds in wheat and barley, at a single application. Full details of the application rates and timings can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Grasp 25 SC"", an aqueous suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor tralkoxydim residues in plants, foodstuff of plant origin, soil and air. The residue definition for monitoring for ground water was defined as tralkoxydim and metabolite R173642(2), however validated monitoring method for this metabolite is not available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Mammalian toxicology of tralkoxydim was assessed in a series of tests. Tralkoxydim is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. It is widely distributed and rapidly excreted. It has no potential for accumulation and is extensively metabolised. It is of moderate oral toxicity and of low toxicity via the dermal and inhalative route. It is a mild skin- and eye irritant and not a skin sensitizer. A classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. In short term toxicity tests with mice, rats, dogs and hamsters, overall, the liver and the adrenal glands were the main targets of toxicity. Tralkoxydim is not genotoxic. Based on increased incidences of Leydig cell tumours in male rats and increases in ovarian tumours in the carcinogenicity study in female hamsters a classification as Xn; Care. Cat. 3 R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" is proposed. Based on adverse effects on gonads observed in hamster, dog and rat in subchronic and chronic studies a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"" is proposed. Based on postimplantation loss and malformations observed in rats and abortions and reduced litters in rabbits, a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" is proposed. Based on these classifications the tralkoxydim metabolite R173642 was considered relevant according to the EU guideline Sanco/221/2000-rev.10. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) have been set at 0.005 mg/kg bw/d based on the effects observed in the 90 day and the 1-year dog study applying a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.01 mg/kg bw has been derived from a rat developmental study applying a safety factor of 100. The exposure estimates for operators handling ""Grasp 25 SC"" are 88% of the AOEL without personal protective equipment (PPE), 82% with gloves during mixing and loading and 68% with gloves during mixing and loading and during application when applying the German model. The corresponding values when applying the UK POEM are 362%, 340% and 80% respectively. On the basis of the model proposed by Hoernicke et al., 19983 predicted exposure for re-entry workers is 4.5% of the AOEL. According to Lloyd and Bell, 19834 indicated exposure of bystanders will be 4% of the AOEL. Tralkoxydim is extensively metabolised in cereals. A complex metabolic pattern was found in forage and straw. The proposed residue definition in cereal grains for monitoring and risk assessment is restricted to the parent compound only as residues of the parent compound and structurally related were assessed to be low for the intended use of tralkoxydim in cereals. At Tier I Annex VI triggers were breached in the long-term scenario for both herbivorous and insectivorous birds and mammals Refined assessment for Yellow wagtail and corn bunting as focal species indicated a low long-term risk to birds. Use of a revised endpoint in the long-term risk assessment for mammals indicated a low risk to insectivorous mammals but a high risk to herbivorous mammals and further refinement is still required. Tralkoxydim is toxic to aquatic organisms, Lemna gibba as the most sensitive species. The risk to aquatic living organisms is considered low for tralkoxydim. The risk to metabolites is also considered to be low except for the photolytic metabolite R159368 where a potential high risk is identified at FOCUSsw Step 3 for one scenario applying 1/10 of parent toxicity data as surrogate endpoint in the risk assessment. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and soil living organisms is considered to be low. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones are required to protect non target plants outside the treated field. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA

The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on mepiquat in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 5 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 20 January 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in January February 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator in cereals for stem stabilisation as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Terpal"" (BAS 098 00 W), a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 305 g/1 mepiquat chloride and 155g/1 ethephon. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection productsare possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices, however some validation data are required for the residue method for milk, egg, fat and muscle. In mammalian toxicity tests, mepiquat-chloride is harmful to rats after oral exposure and is proposed for classification with R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" (LD50 464 mg/kg bw, equivalent to 270 mg/kg bw mepiquat). The dermal LD50 of mepiquat-chloride in rats is >2000 mg/kg bw; mepiquat-chloride is proposed for classification as R20, Harmful by inhalation as the LC50 in the rat for mepiquatchloride was approximately 4.89 mg/1 (equivalent to 2.84 mg/L mepiquat), the maximum attainable concentration under the experimental conditions. Mepiquat-chloride is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a sensitiser. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is an overall NOAEL of 30.5 mg/kg bw/day from 3- and 12-month study in dog that showed salivation and some mortalities, vacuolisation of the kidney and increased accumulation of siderin in the liver and spleen, whose mechanism and toxicological significance is unclear. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any genotoxic or clastogenic potential in a range of in vitro and in vivo studies. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any carcinogenic potential either in rats or mice. The relevant NOAEL in long term toxicity studies in rat is 200 mg/kg bw/day. Mepiquat-chloride does not show any reproductive or developmental toxicity potential: the relevant NOAEL for maternal, reproductive and offspring toxicity is 320 mg/kg bw/day based on reduction in viability and lactation indices, body weight and the impaired morphological development in the offspring; in the developmental toxicity study in rats the NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 150 mg/kg bw/day based on clinical signs of toxicity and impaired body weight gain at 300 mg/kg bw/day and for foetotoxicity and teratogenicity 300 mg/kg bw/day based on the absence of any other signs of toxicity at the highest test dose in the study. In a developmental neurotoxicity study, administration of mepiquat resulted in acute lethality for gavaged pups. The ADI is 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 19.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 12-month dietary study in dogs; the AOEL is 0.3 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 30.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in dogs; the ARfD of 0.3 mg/kg bw for mepiquat-chloride is based on the NOAEL of 30 mg/kg bw/day obtained in the developmental neurotoxicity study. The applied SF is 100. Estimated operator exposure with the German model indicate for operators not wearing PPE levels below the AOEL (10 %) as well as for the UK POEM (70% of the AOEL). Predicted bystander exposure is <1% of the short term systemic AOEL. Workers would not be expected to re-enter treated crops after spraying to perform crop inspection tasks until spray deposits are dry. Estimates of exposure to mepiquat-chloride using data for re-entry exposure contained in the EUROPOEM database indicate exposure levels below the AOEL (3.5%). The metabolism of mepiquat chloride was investigated in wheat, barley, cotton and grapes. The major component in the crops at harvest was unmetabolised mepiquat. Though rotational crops data were not triggered by the residue behaviour of mepiquat chloride in soil, a metabolism study in rotational crops with radio-labelled substance was submitted. The data indicate that in practice residues above the limit of quantification of the analytical method are not expected to occur in succeeding and rotational crops. Currently, only the use of mepiquat chloride on barley would be supported by a sufficient number of valid residue trial data while the notified representative use is on cereals in general. Therefore a data gap for further residue trials was identified. Animal metabolism studies with ruminants and poultry are available to establish the nature of residues in food of animal origin. Since insufficient data is available to assess the magnitude of residues in cereal grain and straw, the livestock exposure assessment cannot be finalised. Moreover, the residue analysed in the livestock feeding studies does not correspond to the proposed animal residue definition for risk assessment, and further data and information is needed to establish reliable transfer factors of residues in food of animal origin and conversion factors for monitoring. Therefore the meeting of experts concluded that the consumer risk assessment and MRL proposals cannot be finalised. If deviating from the notified use on cereals a use of mepiquat-chloride on barley only is considered, consumer exposure is expected to be well below the toxicological reference values for mepiquat-chloride and MRLs could be proposed. With regard to the environmental fate and behaviour data no significant metabolites (>10% AR) were identified in any soil at any time point in laboratory aerobic route and rate of degradation studies using [2,6-14C] mepiquat-chloride. First order DT50 values were in the range 6 to 40 d. In laboratory anaerobic metabolism studies and soil photodegradation studies mepiquat-chloride was observed to undergo insignificant degradation, and no DT50 values could be calculated. Based on evidence from laboratory soil batch adsorption studies mepiquat chloride can be classified as slight to high mobile in soil (Kfoc = 67-4833 mL/g, with a median value of 890 mL/g). For groundwater, the 80th percentile annual average concentrations in leachate leaving the top 1 m soil layer were predicted to be <0.001 g/L for mepiquat-chloride for all FOCUS scenarios pertinent to use on winter cereals. In aerobic natural water/sediment systems, mepiquat-chloride dissipated from the water phase by partitioning to sediment with a first order DT50 of 6 to 9 d. Peak partitioning of mepiquat-chloride to the sediment was measured 14 to 30 d after dosing at a maximum of 56.2% AR. Mineralisation was significant and by the termination of the study (CO2)-C-14 represented 61.7-65.8% AR. No significant quantities of metabolites were detected. First order DT50 values for the whole system were 32 to 33 d. Mepiquat-chloride is essentially non-volatile and there is little potential for volatilisation from either soil or plant surfaces. Consequently, air is not a likely route of environmental contamination. Birds and mammals may be exposed to mepiquat-chloride by intake of insects present in the treated crop. Since mepiquat-chloride is to be applied after BBCH growth stage 31 the crop itself is assumed to be past the stage were it is attractive as food. The acute and short-term TER values for birds are well above the Annex VI triggers in the first tier assessment, hence indicating a low risk. For mammals, both the acute and long-term TER values are well above the triggers, hence the risk to mammals is considered as low. The first -tier long-term TER value for birds is 4.4 and thus below the Annex VI trigger of 5. A new long-term (reproduction) study with birds was presented in an addendum (June 2007) together with a new risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) as a focal species. The refinement of PT and PD were accepted by the experts and the refined long-term TER of 8.53 was above the trigger of 5. The risk to birds from the second active substance (ethephon) in the representative formulation ""Terpal"" was considered in the acute risk assessment presented in the addendum. The acute TERs were still above the trigger and the acute risk from the formulation was considered as sufficiently addressed. A risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water according to SANCO/ 4145/2000 was included in the addendum. The acute TERs of >7.3 (birds) and 2.2 (mammals) were below the trigger of 10. No agreement was reached in the expert meeting on the relevance of this exposure route for the suggested use in cereals. It was proposed by the experts that this point should be left open to be considered at MS level after Annex I inclusion since the relevance of this exposure scenario may depend on the local weather conditions and the landscape structure (availability of alternative drinking water sources). The most sensitive aquatic organism tested and driving the aquatic risk assessment was Lemna gibba. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 with FOCUS step 1 PECs,, indicating a low risk. Mepiquatchloride partitions into sediment, and was found in amounts of 48-56% of applied in the water/sediment studies. However, since the NOEC for Daphnia is 12.5 mg/L, which is >0.1 mg/L, a study with sediment dwelling organisms is not required according to SANCO/3268/2001. The log P. for mepiquat-chloride is <3 and therefore the potential for bioconcentration is considered as low. No major metabolites (>10%) were detected in the water/sediment study The risk to bees, other non -target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.136r,"Bromuconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bromuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 14 November 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed during a written procedure in February March 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on wheat full details of the gap can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""EXP10064C"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bromuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The remaining issues are that the technical specification can not be finalised and there is a data gap identified for a dissociation constant study. In mammals, bromuconazole oral LD50 is 328 mg/kg bw (classification as ""harmful if swallowed"" (Xn; R22), proposed). The acute toxicity by dermal and inhalation route is low (LD50>2000 mg/kg bw and LC50>5 mg/L). Bromuconazole is neither skin nor eye irritant. It is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose toxicity studies, the liver is the target organ. In subchronic tests, the dog is the most sensitive species, with an overall relevant NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day whereas in rat the NOAEL is 13.8 mg/kg bw/day. In genotoxicity testing there was some indication of weak clastogenicity in vitro, however there was no indication of positive results were in vivo, neither in the micronucleus assay nor in the UDS assay. Overall, bromuconazole was considered devoid of genotoxic potential. The relevant NOAEL for long term toxicity and carcinogenicity in rat is 0.88 mg/kg bw/day: treatment-related neoplastic lesions in rodents occurred at high doses: hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas in rats and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. In both rats and mice, the tumours were likely caused by liver toxicity and subsequent cell renewal. Overall, it was agreed that bromuconazole does not have carcinogenic potential relevant to humans. Bromuconazole did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: parental and foetal toxicity NOAELs were established at 1.3 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was established at 141 mg/kg bw/day. As for developmental toxicity, in the rat the relevant maternal NOAEL is 70 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, based on a dose-dependent increase of placental weight and ossification delays or supernumerary bones in a number of skeletal structures. It was agreed to propose classification Cat 3, Xn; R63, 'May cause harm to unborn child'. The ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant long term toxicity/carcinogenicity NOAEL of 0.88 mg/kg bw/day from the 2 year rat study, applying an SF of 100. For the ARID, the value is based on the developmental NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study, with an SF of 100, leading to an ARID of 0.1 mg/kg bw. The AOEL of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day was set on basis of the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dog study (applying a standard SF of 100). The operator exposure showed exposure levels below the AOEL (15.6%) with the application of the German model and the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application and coveralls and sturdy footwear during application. The estimated exposure for re-entry activities (scouting) is 1.5% of the AOEL. The bystander exposure is estimated to be 1.6% of the AOEL. The metabolism of bromuconazole was investigated in wheat (relevant to the notified use). Additional metabolism data was submitted for the category of fruit crops. A metabolic pathway could be established in cereals. At harvest, bromuconazole was still a major part of the terminal residue in cereal matrices and identified metabolites were individually below 10% of the total residue. However, there was indication of preferential metabolism of one bromuconazole diastereomer (LS 850647), as a significant shift in the ratio of diastereomers was found in the residues determined in the mature cereal crop when compared to the ratio in the initially applied bromuconazole. Whether the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was subject to any shift was not investigated. In rotational crops studies there was uptake of residues from soil into succeeding cereal, oilseed, root and leafy crops. Upon analysis of the residues the two bromuconazole diastereomers were identified as major residue, and similar to the primary cereal metabolism their ratio had been shifted compared to the one in the bromuconazole applied to the soil. No information is available on the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer. The submitted livestock metabolism data in ruminants and poultry allows to establish a metabolic pathway, and suggests that no residues in food of animal origin above the limit of quantification are expected when cereals treated according the cGAP are used in livestock diet. The data implies that there might be preferential metabolism of one diastereomers also in livestock animals The ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was not investigated. As plant and livestock residue data indicate that from the notified use no significant consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues is expected, the observed shift of the isomer ratio in the terminal residue is currently not a concern with regard to consumer safety. This may have to be reconsidered when authorisation of uses is sought that lead to consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues above the limit of quantification. The meeting of experts noted that all studies were performed using phenyl-labelled bromuconazole only, and thus the fate of the triazole moiety of the molecule was not investigated. The experts agreed that based on the available data and information cleavage of the molecule cannot be excluded and further investigation of the triazole moiety is required to address potential consumer exposure to triazole derivative metabolites. Until then, the plant and animal residue definition is provisional, and consequently the consumer risk assessment is not finalised. In soil under aerobic conditions bromuconazole exhibits high to very high persistence forming several minor (< 10% AR) metabolites. Mineralisation was limited accounting for only 1-4.4% AR after 100120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 5-17.6 % AR after 100120 days. Laboratory soil photolysis study indicated that photolysis may contribute to the degradation of bromuconazole at the soil surface. As a consequence, the experts agreed that the available dissipation rates do not represent biodegradation that can be used as input to FOCUS modelling. Bromuconazole exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Provisional PECsoil accumulation value was obtained from accumulation field studies. Bromuconazole is essentially stable to hydrolysis and photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of bromuconazole in natural aquatic systems. In dark natural sediment water systems bromuconazole partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.9 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented maximum 15% AR at study end. Potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater cannot be adequately assessed because reliable degradation rates in soil under field conditions are not available. The first-tier TER values for herbivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. Also the acute and short-term TERs for insectivorous birds were well above the trigger while the long-term TER of 4.4 indicated a potential high long-term risk. The RMS considered the long-term risk as addressed based on the argument that refinement of PT and PD would lead to a TER above the trigger of 5. However no further information/argumentation was provided to support a PT or PD refinement. The experts agreed that the risk needs to be addressed further and an open point was set for the RMS to conduct a refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds. No new risk assessment was provided and a data gap is proposed by EFSA to address the long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The risk to mammals was assessed for small herbivorous mammals for the early application, and to insectivorous mammals for the late application. The acute TERs for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals were above the trigger of 10 (including refinement of residues in plant material). The choice of the long-term endpoint was discussed in the expert meeting. The experts considered effects on bodyweight and bodyweight gain observed at the dose of 13.8 mg a.s./kg bw/d as relevant and suggested to use the next lower dose of 1.3 mg a.s/kg bw/d as the NOAEL in the risk assessment. The updated risk assessment resulted in long-term TERs below the trigger of 5. Further refinement of the long-term risk to herbivorous, insectivorous and vermivorous mammals is necessary. Bromuconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. A potential high risk was indicated in with FOCUS step3 PECsw values. The available information suggests that substantial risk mitigation measures would be required to meet the Annex VI triggers. No agreed reliable PECsw values are currently available to conclude on the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for non-target arthropods was not in accordance to the ESCORT II scheme. The standard glass plate tests suggests that there will be some adverse effects on sensitive non-target arthropods. Extended lab studies gave an indication that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. Concerns were raised with regard to the comparability of the different formulations used in the studies with non-target arthropods. EFSA agrees to the assessment of the RMS that the formulations are sufficiently similar to conclude on the risk to non-target arthropods for the representative use. The applicant informed that a different formulation than Granit will be marketed. It is suggested that a risk assessment for this formulation is conducted at MSs level after the decision on Annex I inclusion. The formulation Granit had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test at an application rate of 180 g a.s./ha and 500 g a.s./ha. The soil concentration was calculated in the DAR as 0.67 mg a.s./ha. This concentration did not cover the interim PECplateau concentration of 0.832 mg a.s./kg soil and hence a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. However it was noted after the expert meeting that the theoretical soil concentration in the litterbag-study was calculated for an application rate of 500 g a.s./ha only but should also include the rate of 180 g a.s./ha. The recalculated theoretical soil concentration of 0.907 mg/kg soil would cover the interim PECplateau concentration and hence no new litterbag-study is required. Effects of >25% on nitrogen transformation were observed at an application rate of 400 g a.s./ha (0.53 mg a.s./kg soil). The tested concentration of 0.53 mg a.s./kg soil does not cover the interim plateau PECsoil. A potential high risk to soil micro-organisms cannot be excluded and new studies are necessary to cover the peak PECsoil concentration. The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluazinam,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.137r,"Fluazinam is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fluazinam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 3 January 2006. The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISK Biosciences Europe. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to potatoes against late blight and tuber blight (Phytophtora infestans). Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Fluazinam 5005C"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L fluazinam. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin, for environmental matrices and for body fluids and tissues. Concerning the mammalian toxicology, the toxicokinetic studies have shown that oral absorption of fluazinam was 35% of the administered dose. In the acute studies, fluazinam was harmful by inhalation (Xn, R20), severely irritating to the eyes (Xi, R41) and skin sensitizer (R43). The liver was the target organ in repeat dose studies with rats, mice and dogs. Some haematological changes were also observed in dogs, and the increased vacuolation of white matter in brain and spinal cord observed at high doses was demonstrated to be directly related to one impurity. Therefore it was agreed that the level of this impurity in the technical specification should not exceed the amount present in the toxicological batches, i.e. 0.2%. Based on the effects observed in the skin in the repeat dose study by dermal administration, the classification Xi, R38 Irritating to the skin was proposed for fluazinam. In the genotoxicity studies, no mutagenic potential was observed in vitro or in vivo. There was no carcinogenic potential in long term studies. In the reproduction studies, the fertility parameters and the offspring were not affected, but the indications of teratogenicity in the rat studies led to the proposal of classification Reprotox. Cat. 3, R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. No adverse effect on the nervous system was observed in specific neurotoxicity studies with rats. The relative toxicity of the plant metabolite trifuoro-acetic acid (TFAA) in comparison with fluazinam could not be established based on the available data. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, the acute reference dose (ARfD) 0.07 mg/kg bw and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) 0.004 mg/kg bw/day, all derived with the use of a safety factor 100. The dermal absorption values were 1.5% for the concentrate and 7% for the dilution. The operator exposure estimate is below the AOEL according to the German model when personal protective equipment is used, and the worker exposure estimates (during crop inspection or harvesting) are below the AOEL with the use of personal protective equipment. Based on appropriate metabolism studies, the metabolism of fluazinam in potatoes is clearly elucidated. Parent compound, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and AMGT are present at harvest in potato tubers at low but comparable amounts and are included in the residue definition for risk assessment. A further degradation product was identified as TFAA. This metabolite is present at very low levels in potato tubers but also in rotational crops. As information on its toxicological properties is lacking, the proposed residue definition is provisional. For enforcement, the residue definition can be restricted to parent compound. Supervised residue trials show that the MRL for potatoes can be set at the LOQ (limit of quantification level). Livestock exposure to fluazinam residues is very low and the setting of a residue definition and MRLs in animal products is not necessary. Under restriction of the information to be provided on the toxicological relevance of TFAA and if appropriate on the actual consumer exposure to this metabolite, no dietary risk is expected resulting from the representative use of fluazinam in potatoes. It must be noted that the issue related to TFAA is a generic issue and potentially concerns a range of active substances containing a trifluoromethyl moiety. Under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, fluazinam is medium to high persistent in soil. Substitution of phenyl ring chlorine by hydroxyl in fluazinam yields the major soil metabolite HYPA that was shown to be moderate to high persistent under these conditions. Other minor metabolites identified resulted from the reduction of the phenyl nitro groups to form the corresponding anilines. In the experiment performed in the most recent study (1 soil) up to 14 minor metabolites were found and none of them individually exceeded 4.7 % AR. Metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the bridging amino group have not been identified in any of the available studies. After 90 d non extractable residues reached levels of 16.7 50.5 % AR and mineralization was almost negligible. Fluazinam was low to moderate persistent under dark anaerobic conditions due to the relatively rapid reduction of the nitro groups to form the MAPA, AMPA-FLUAZINAM and DAPA metabolites. Higher amounts of non extractable residues were formed under these conditions. Photolysis was shown to contribute to the degradation of fluazinam in soil. HYPA and AMPA-FLUAZINAM are found as minor photolysis metabolites. There are field dissipation studies available in UK (two sites), Germany (four sites) and USA (four sites). USA field trials were considered not relevant for EU conditions and were not used in the risk assessment. The potential effect of photolysis on the degradation of fluazinam in these field trials was discussed in the experts' meeting. The meeting agreed that the kinetic parameters derived from the field trials were not appropriate for use in environmental modelling and that new FOCUS PECsw and FOCUS PECGw will need to be calculated on basis of laboratory data. Furthermore, since the studies were performed on bare soil they were not considered representative of the uses proposed. Therefore new PEC soil calculation using the longest laboratory half life and application every two years for potato was regarded as necessary by the meeting. After the experts meeting, new PEC soil have been presented by the rapporteur Member State in an updated addendum to B.8 following the parameters agreed by the meeting. According batch soil adsorption / desorption studies available fluazinam may be considered slight to low mobile and HYPA low to medium mobile. Fluazinam may be considered stable at pH 4 and it is rapidly hydrolysed at pH 7 and pH 9. The major hydrolysis metabolite at pH 7 and 9 was CAPA that is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental dissipation of fluazinam Fluazinam is not readily biodegradable according the available study. In water sediment systems fluazinam partitioned with the sediment and was converted to a number of metabolites through substitution of chlorine atom and reduction of nitro groups. Among these metabolites only AMPA-FLUAZINAM reached levels above 10 % in the sediment phase. Non extractable residues amounted up to 55 % AR after 100 d and mineralization was practically negligible. There are no indications that the amino bridge between the two rings is broken during the degradation. Dissipation rate of metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM was calculated with data of one of the systems. The rapporteur Member State provided in an addendum the whole system kinetic parameters for HYPA based on a multicompartmental fitting of the data of both systems. The rapporteur Member State identified shortcomings in the water/sediment study that do not invalidate it in its integrity but need to be considered when using the results for risk assessment. PECsw for fluazinam and for the major sediment metabolite AMPA-FLUAZINAM were presented in the DAR for the representative use in potatoes. The input parameters used in the applicant's calculation for fluazinam were not agreed by the meeting. After the meeting, the rapporteur Member State presented new FOCUS PECsw and PECSED for Fluazinam and HYPA using the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts in the updated addendum to B.8. Potential ground water contamination by fluazinam and the major soil metabolite HYPA for the representative use in potatoes may be considered negligible with the available modelling. Fluazinam may be relatively persistent in air but a high degree of uncertainty is associated to the estimation of its atmospheric half life. However, it is not volatile enough to perform an experimental measurement of its atmospheric photochemical stability. The risk assessment followed the Guidance Document on Risk Assessment for Birds and Mammals (SANCO/4145/2000). It is not considered necessary to calculate the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals in potatoes as potato leaves are considered unpalatable. Therefore the risk to herbivorous birds and mammals is considered to be low. Based on the first tier risk assessment the risk to insectivorous birds and mammals can be regarded as low for the representative use of fluazinam evaluated. As the Log Pow of fluazinam exceeds 3, the risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals can be considered as low. Also the risk to earthworm eating birds can be considered as low, whereas as further refinement is still required to identify low risk for earthworm eating mammals No risk is expected for birds or mammals from the ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Fish was the most sensitive aquatic organisms on an acute and chronic time scale in the standard dataset. All scenarios were acceptable at FOCUSsw step 4, including a buffer zone of 10 m. The risk to aquatic invertebrates and algae is considered low at FOCUS Step 3 and Step 2 respectively. The risk to HYPA and G-504 is inconclusive due to lack of toxicity data. The risk to sediment dwelling organisms is concluded to be low, but risk assessment based on sediment concentrations is missing. The risk for bees and NTA is considered low from the representative use of fluazinam. As for the earthworms the acute risk assessment indicated indicating a low acute risk to earthworms. Whereas the reproductive study on earthworms did not meet the Annex VI trigger, a field study with earthworms addressed the long term risk to earthworms. Given the DT90field in soil for fluazinam and the observed effects on earthworms and A. rhopalosiphi, a study on the effects on collembolan was submitted. The toxicity to collembolan triggered a litterbag study. At litterbag study was submitted bud not accepted as the exposure was to low. A data gap was identified for a new litterbag study, in which the new PECplateau is covered. In this study the presence of and effects on macro organisms should be checked. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considerer to be low for both fluazinam and HYPA.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance benfluralin,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.127r,"Benfluralin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review program covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on benfluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 16 February 2006. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in May - June 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on lettuce and chicory (salad and root production) full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Bonalan"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor benfluralin in plants, soil water and air. However for water and plants the residue definition has not been concluded on and further data may be required. For products of animal origin it is currently not clear if a residue definition is required and therefore further methods may be required in the future. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are still some outstanding issues related to a relevant impurity, R65 classification, emulsion stability, efficiency of the tank cleaning procedure and testing at different pH for various parameters. In mammalian metabolism studies, benfluralin showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption, rapid excretion, mainly via faeces, and no potential for accumulation. Benfluralin has a low acute toxicity, but showed irritating and sensitizing properties, which require classification with R36/38 irritating to eyes and skin and R43 may cause sensitisation by skin contact. Main target organs in short term and long term studies were the liver and kidneys. Classification with R40 limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect is proposed, based on neoplastic changes observed in the liver of rats and mice and thyroid tumours in rats upon long term exposure. Benfluralin showed no potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity. No effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed as well as any adverse effects on development or teratogenicity. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.005 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day set using an assessment factor of 100 with a correction of 30 % for oral absorption (overall assessment factor of 333); no acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves is used, at least during the mixing and loading operations. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from benfluralin applications. The plant metabolism of benfluralin was investigated in lettuce (category leafy crops), alfalfa and peanuts (pulses/ oilseed crop category). The Meeting of experts considered that the detailed information on the undertaken preliminary work on the metabolites characterisation/ identification should be submitted in order to conclude on the validity of these studies. No metabolism study was submitted to support a use in root and tuber crops. The experts in residues have concluded that further data is necessary to finalise the residue definition for primary and rotational crops, the livestock exposure assessment and eventually the consumer risk assessment. At the current stage, a residue definition and MRLs can only provisionally be proposed, but need to be reconsidered upon receipt of the necessary data. Based on the presumption that the only relevant residues for consumer exposure is parent benfluralin in primary crops, the estimated chronic intake would be less than 1% of the ADI of benfluralin for the considered consumer groups. The consumer risk assessment will have to be revised when the outstanding data and information was evaluated. Available data demonstrate that under aerobic conditions the degradation of benfluralin in soil did not lead to any major (> 10% of the applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite, although the minor non transient metabolite B12 was formed in amounts > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points. Benfluralin is moderate to medium persistent in soil under aerobic conditions with half-lives ranging from 20 to 86 days. No reliable DT50 values for metabolite B12 are available. Field dissipation studies were conducted in northern Europe only and resulted in moderate half-lives of 34 to 73 days for benfluralin. Two major metabolites B36 (max. 23.2% AR at day 1) and U6#1 (max. 25.0% AR at day 2) were formed under anaerobic conditions. The peer review concluded that, if applied for intended uses, no further assessment was necessary for these metabolites. Soil photolysis is not expected to be a significant route of degradation in the environment. Data indicate that benfluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. No reliable data on adsorption properties of metabolite B12 are available. Benfluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmental conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of benfluralin producing the major metabolites des-alkyl benfluralin diamine (max 11.5% AR), propyl benzimidazole (max. 16.4% AR), methyl benzimidazole (max 11.5% AR), ethyl propyl benzimidazole (max 19.5% AR). Because of the rapid photodegradation of benfluralin in water, a data gap was identified by the fate experts to address the potential surface water contamination of the photolysis metabolites. Parent benfluralin is not expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use. The meeting of Member State experts identified a data gap with respect to metabolite B12 for the necessary information (including experimentally derived Koc values and degradation rates) to produce revised FOCUS groundwater assessment. The water/sediment study, the aerobic soil metabolism study and Henry's Law constant indicated the high volatility of benfluralin. However, the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation half-life of benfluralin in air is rapid (<6 hrs) and therefore significant amounts of benfluralin are not expected to be present in air. Benfluralin is applied pre-sowing or pre-planting by broadcast spray followed by incorporation in soil to control weeds. Hence no leafy crops or weeds are present in the field after the application. Benfluralin is not systemic and the uptake of plants is limited. A potential high risk was identified for earthworm eating-birds and mammals. The suggested refinements were not accepted in the expert meeting and a data gap was identified for a new refined long-term risk assessment for earthworm eating birds and mammals. The risk to algae and higher aquatic plants was assessed as low. A 20m non-spray buffer zone was included in the PECsw values used in the aquatic risk assessment for the water bodies stream and ditch. The TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in all drainage scenarios (D3, D4, D6) and in the run-off scenarios R1 and R4 but were below the trigger in the runoff scenarios R2 and R3. No full FOCUS scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 for aquatic invertebrates. Only the TERs for the part scenarios D4 (pond) and R1 (pond) exceeded the trigger of 100. The chronic TER values for fish and daphnia were calculated with 50 d twa-PECsw instead of initial PECsw. The experts agreed that time weighted average PECsw values can be used in the TER calculations for endpoints based on growth effects (fish early life stage study) but the rapid dissipation from the water phase has to be considered and the time period should not be longer than 5 times the DT50 (in this case 7days). The chronic endpoint for daphnids is based on reproduction and therefore should be compared to initial PECsw concentrations. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new chronic aquatic risk assessment taking into account the suggestions of the expert meeting and to refine further the acute risk to invertebrates. No final conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms from the photolysis metabolites at this stage and should be addressed in the new aquatic risk assessment in line with the data gap identified in the section on fate and behaviour. The risk assessment for soil non-target arthropods resulted in a TER of 4.8 based on an initial PEC soil of 1.14 mg benfluralin/kg from the worst case application in lettuce. Since the TER value is close to the trigger of 5 and based on initial PECs it was agreed in the expert meeting that the risk to soil non-target arthropods is sufficiently addressed for most environmental conditions but Member States could ask for further risk refinement if benfluralin is expected to degrade slowly under their local environmental conditions. The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target arthropods, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.144r,"Fenpropimorph is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpropimorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 17 March 2005. The peer review was initiated on 11 July 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in July September 2006. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January and March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprises foliar spraying to cereals, sugar beet and sunflower against several agriculturally important phytopathogens. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Corbel"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 750 g/L fenpropimorph. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant and animal origin and for environmental matrices. With regard to the rat metabolism during the toxicological studies, fenpropimorph is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, largely distributed, extensively metabolised and without bioaccumulation in the body. In the acute toxicity studies, the compound was shown to be harmful if swallowed (R22) and irritating to the skin (R38). In the short term studies, the liver was the target organ and the body weight was decreased in all species. A battery of tests for mutagenicity did not demonstrate a genotoxic potential in vivo, and long term studies in rats and mice didn't show carcinogenic effects. No effects on the reproductive parameters were observed in a multigeneration study in rats, but teratogenic findings in rats and rabbits led to the proposed classification Repro Cat.3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child. In specific neurotoxicity studies, adverse effects were only observed in the functional observational battery. Changes in serum acetyl cholinesterase activity were not considered as relevant adverse effects. In mechanistic studies, fenpropimorph was shown to induce hepatic drug metabolising enzymes and to inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis. The agreed ADI (acceptable daily intake) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the agreed AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) 0.007 mg/kg bw/day and the agreed ARID (acute reference dose) 0.03 mg/kg bw. The agreed dermal absorption value was 10%, and the operator exposure assessment is below the AOEL only within the German model with the use of PPE (personal protective equipment). The plant metabolism of fenpropimorph has been elucidated and appropriate residue definitions can be proposed for monitoring and risk assessment. All representative uses are not supported by appropriate residue data and further data should be submitted. No residues are expected in rotational crops under practical conditions above analytical limit of quantification. Fenpropimorph residues are not altered under processing conditions. A transfer of residues to livestock consuming treated feedstuffs may result in measurable residue levels in animal commodities. MRLs are proposed for plant and animal commodities. The resulting consumer exposure has been assessed and found to be below the toxicological reference values. However it should be noted that there is uncertainty related to the isomer ratio the consumer is actually exposed to. If MRLs need to be raised as a consequence of the results of the required residue trials, the consumer risk assessment should be reconsidered. In soil under aerobic conditions fenpropimorph exhibits low to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolites fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2)(2) (accounting for up to 9.7% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and BF-421-7' (accounting for up to 9.8%AR) which also exhibited low persistence in the single soil where peer reviewed information was available. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and morpholine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 33 and 46 % AR respectively after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 65 and 50 % AR respectively after 91 days. Fenpropimorph is immobile or exhibits slight mobility in soil, fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) exhibits very high to high mobility in soil. A data gap was identified for information on the soil mobility of BF 421-7. There was no indication that adsorption of fenpropimorph was pH dependent. The adsorption of fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is pH dependent, with adsorption decreasing as soil pH increases. The assessment of soil accumulation potential under conditions represented by one of the German field trial sites has not been finalised. In dark natural sediment water systems fenpropimorph partitioned relatively rapidly to sediment, where it exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) which partitioned back to the water accounting for up to 22% AR in water. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 6.3-8.5 % AR (mean of the phenyl and morpholine ring radiolabels) at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 20-37 % AR (mean of both radiolabels) at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpropimorph at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation factors being appropriately applied at step 4. Volatilisation short range transport and redeposition of fenpropimorph to surface water using the results of field and wind tunnel experiments were included in the step 4 calculations, due to the potential for volatilisation of fenpropimorph which has a relatively high vapour pressure compared to many active substances. For the metabolite fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2), appropriate FOCUS step 1 calculations were agreed. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpropimorph and fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the soil metabolite BF-421-7, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. It was concluded that fenpropimorph is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 2.9 hours). The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for the representative uses in cereals, sugar beet and sunflower. The long term TER values for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and for herbivorous mammals were below the Annex VI trigger value of 5 for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment was discussed in the expert meeting. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4. The long-term trigger of 5 was exceeded for the uses in cereals and sugar beet. The risk assessment presented deviated for skylark from the recommendations in the experts meeting. It was assumed that skylark feeds only on large insects (RUD of 5.1 instead of 29 for small insects) based on data from a PhD theses. This refinement step was not peer-reviewed and without this refinement the TER for skylark would be below the trigger of 5. However it is likely that a certain percentage of the insect prey consist of large insects. The long-term endpoint is based on a NOEC where no effects were observed at the highest tested dose. Therefore it may be possible to agree in a weight of evidence approach that the long-term risk to skylark can be regarded as sufficiently addressed. No accepted risk refinement is available for the use in sunflower. The refined long-term risk assessment for the uses in sugar beet and sunflower based on hare (medium herbivorous mammal) resulted in TERs above the trigger of 5 and were accepted by the experts. The vole (Microtus arvalis) was rejected as a focal species for the use in cereals. The risk assessment provided in addendum 4 (not peer-reviewed) was conducted according to the recommendations of the expert meeting (wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus as a focal species and refinement of PD). The resulting TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low risk. The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish was assessed as low. Potential endocrine disrupting properties of fenpropimorph were discussed in the meeting. On the basis of the available information it was agreed that endocrine disrupting effects due to aromatase inhibition are unlikely to occur. Overall it is concluded that the risk to birds and mammals is expected to be low for the uses evaluated except for the use in sunflower where the long-term risk to birds needs further refinement. The long-term toxicity to fish was driving the aquatic risk assessment. In the expert meeting it was agreed to use the NOEC of 1.95 lag a.s./L from an early life stage study (ELS) conducted under a realistic exposure situation. The endpoint (NOEC) of 1.95 g a.s./L was suggested to be used in the risk assessment in combination with the maximum peak PECsw value. A new risk assessment was presented in the not peer-reviewed addendum 4 from February 2008. The TER calculation presented in the addendum combined no-spray buffer zones with drift reduction nozzles and run-off mitigation to achieve TERs above the trigger of 10. No spray buffer zones of >20 metres alone are not sufficient to achieve a full FOCUS step4 scenario with TERs >10. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be refined further. The major metabolite in the water-sediment system fenpropimorph carboxylic acid (BF-421-2) is of low acute toxicity to fish, daphnids and algae. The risk from BF 4212 to aquatic organisms is considered as low. A short-term impact on sensitive arthropod species is likely to occur in the in-field area after application of fenpropimorph. However given the rapid residue decline in plants it is likely that the treated area is recolonised within a short period of time from unaffected off-crop areas. Therefore it was agreed by the experts that the risk to non-target arthropods is low for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. However, the first-tier long-term (reproduction) TERs were <5. A field study with earthworms was made available by the applicant. No effects were observed on abundance and total biomass of earthworms. The observation period in the study was too short to detect potential effects on the reproduction of those earthworm species with long reproductive cycles. However the study gives an indication that the long term risk to earthworms is low. The experts agreed to the assessment of the RMS and considered the risk to earthworms as sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. However as the soil exposure assessment is not finalised (as the accumulation potential in soil is not finalised), the risk assessment to earthworms cannot be finalised. Statistical significant effects of 7.4 % to 19.3 % were observed in the litterbag study. The experts considered the effects as relevant and the study was too short to exclude adverse effects on organic matter breakdown. The experts considered a new study in accordance with the latest guidance as necessary. The risk to bees, soil micro-organisms (subject to finalisation of the soil exposure assessment), non target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance epoxiconazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.138r,"Epoxiconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on epoxiconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 28 April 2005. The peer review was initiated on 7 October 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF as identified by the rapporteur Member State. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in July - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007 (in all sections) and in May 2007 (only ecotox). A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place in a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals and sugar beet. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Opus"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of epoxiconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It has been identified that more information is necessary to enable the impact of potential different isomer ratios on the risk assessments to be better characterised Mammalian toxicology of epoxiconazole was assessed in a row of tests. Epoxiconazole is absorbed rapidly but only to a limited extent (about 50%) after oral administration in rats. It is widely distributed in the body and although epoxiconazole has no potential for accumulation its elimination is slow. The substance is mainly excreted via faeces (about 78%) and urine (about 17%). Metabolism is rapid and extensive. At least 47 different metabolites have been identified in the rat. The active substance is of low acute toxicity by the oral, dermal and inhalation route. It is neither irritant to the skin nor to the eyes and has no skin sensitising potential. The liver has been identified as the main target of toxicity in repeated dose tests with rats, mice and dogs. Epoxiconazole does not have genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. In a 24-months study in rats liver toxicity was observed and additionally ovary- and adrenal gland tumours were seen. In a 18 month carcinogenicity study in mice a treatment related increase in liver tumours has been observed based on which a classification of epoxiconazole as Xn; Care. Cat. 3 R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Based on the effects on reproduction seen in a two generation study in rats (dystocia, impaired fertility, prolonged gestation and vaginal haemorrhages) it was concluded to propose a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"". Based on developmental effects such as increases in number of resorptions, skeletal variations and malformations observed in relevant studies in rats and rabbits also a classification with Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R 63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. Results from new in vitro studies and a new developmental study in rats confirm that epoxiconazole has endocrine disrupting properties but do not merit changing relevant NOAELs or revising the proposed classification according to an evaluation by the rapporteur Member State. However, these new data have not been peer reviewed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.008 mg/kg bw/d derived from an 18-month carcinogenicity study in mice applying a safety factor of 100. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.023 mg/kg bw has been derived based on the effects observed in two generation reproduction study in rats applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.008 mg/kg bw/d was derived from a subchronic dog study applying a safety factor of 100. In consideration of a dermal absorption of 50% both for the concentrate and the diluted preparation (the default value agreed upon by the majority of experts at PRAPeR 19, March 2007) the exposure estimates for operators were 39% and 700% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) with the German model and the UK POEM respectively. When no PPE is worn the values rise to 991% and 4918% respectively. Exposures for re-entry workers were amounted to 55.8% (without PPE) and 2.8% (with PPE) of the systemic AOEL respectively. Exposure of bystanders was estimated to amount to 3.75% of the systemic AOEL. The metabolism of epoxiconazole in plants after foliar application is limited. Accordingly the proposed residue definition for monitoring is restricted to the parent compound. Indications are present that the accumulation of triazole metabolites in cereal grains is limited but due to some inadequacies in the design of the wheat metabolism study a firm conclusion on this is not possible. A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials are available and MRL can be proposed covering the representative uses in cereals and sugar beets in both Northern and Southern European regions. The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. Processing data show that residues are preferably transferred to the bran fraction during the milling process and that no residue above the limit of quantification (LOQ) is expected to be present in beer from the brewing process. Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to epoxiconazole residues above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole metabolites (triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) has been demonstrated at least for cereals. Feed commodities from cereals and sugar beets may represent a significant source of exposure to epoxiconazole residues for animals Livestock metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues the residue definition for monitoring can be restricted to the parent compound. Feeding studies in dairy cows are available and appropriate MRLs for animal products can be proposed. For the time being the residue definition in plant and animal products for risk assessment is restricted to the parent compound. Inclusion of triazole derivative metabolites in this definition will need to be considered at a later stage. These compounds (mainly triazole, triazole alanine and triazole acetic acid) which are common metabolites of all triazole fungicides have been recognized as hazards given their impact on reproduction. Toxicological reference values have been agreed by the PRAPeR expert meeting 14 on toxicology in January 2007. Chronic and acute consumer exposures assessments have been carried out for parent compound only and were found to be well below the respective toxicological trigger values of epoxiconazole. Therefore provisionally no risk for the consumer has been identified under restriction of an uncertainty related to the isomer ratio consumer is actually exposed to. A robust conclusion on the risk will be possible when information on the actual level of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin will be available. It must be noted that this lack of data is a generic issue and concerns all active substances of the triazole chemical class when their degradation pathway in primary crops, soil and livestock involves a cleavage of the triazole ring. Sufficient data were available to demonstrate that in soil epoxiconazole exhibits medium to very high persistence. The available laboratory studies did not identify any major (> 10% AR) soil metabolites. One metabolite appearing in minor (max. 6.6% AR after 175 days) amounts is 1,2,4-triazole. Other possible degradation products after separation of the aromatic rings are simple monohalogenated acids. Metabolite 1,2,4-triazole is rapidly degraded by soil micro-organisms and it has low persistence, with a reported laboratory mean half-life of 8 days. In anaerobic soils, the first step in degradation is cleavage of the oxirane ring resulting in the formation of the alcohol, which is readilydehydrated to the alkene BF 480 entriazole (max. 8.6% AR after 120 days). Epoxiconazole is quite stable at soil surfaces under the influence of light. Epoxiconazole is slightly to moderately adsorbed to soil and the leaching potential is low. Lysimeter studies were not triggered and FOCUS PEC groundwater calculations revealed no risk for groundwater contamination for the active substance or 1,2,4-triazole. A plateau concentration in soil of 0.167 mg/kg for epoxiconazole was calculated based on field accumulation studies. Epoxiconazole and 1,2,4-triazole are hydrolytically stable at pH 5, 7 and 9. They are also stable under the influence of light in aqueous buffer solutions. However, in a sensitized photolysis study with natural water, epoxiconazole degraded with a half life of 52 days. After a rapid sorption of the parent compound to the sediment, the predominant metabolite in both investigated water/sediment systems was BF 480-entriazole, being almost exclusively detected in the sediment phase (max. 32.3% AR after 59 days). Once in the sediment, BF 480-entriazole degrades with first order DT50 of 32-65 days. Besides CO2, no further degradation products of epoxiconazole were detected in significant amounts in both test systems during the incubation period. The calculated first order half lives of epoxiconazole for the total systems were 68 and 172 days. Some uncertainties were found in the assessment of the accumulation potential of BF 480-entriazole in sediment. The volatilization experiments showed that epoxiconazole exhibits a very low average volatilization rate from plant and soil surfaces. It is not a relevant pathway for dissipation. If it however reached the troposphere it would be degraded with a half life of 4 days indicating a potential for long range atmospheric transport. After the experts' meeting the rapporteur Member State re-estimated a half-life of 1.83 days, but the calculation is not peer reviewed. The first tier TER values indicated a potential high long-term risk to birds and mammals Measured residues were accepted in the expert meeting to refine the RUD values for herbivorous birds and mammals and to set the multiple application factor (MAF) to 1 provided that the residue studies were conducted with an application interval equal or lower than the interval of 21 days as suggested GAP. Whether it is sufficiently justified to use a MAF of 1 although intervals between applications were above 21 days for about half of the residues studies needs to be evaluated further at Member State level. The DT50 refinement for residue decline in plants was also discussed and it is suggested to use the geometric mean value of 14.5 days based on the available residue data. The suggested refinements of PT and PD used in the long-term risk assessment for birds were not sufficiently supported by data and therefore rejected in the meeting of experts. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the long-term risk assessment for birds. The hare (Lepus europaeus), common vole (Microtus arvalis) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) were chosen as focal species to refine the long-term risk assessment for herbivorous mammals. The experts agreed to use the hare and the wood mouse as focal species in the refined risk assessment as suggested in addendum 2. The proposed PT value of 0.3 for hare was not accepted by the meeting since it was not based on radio-tracking data. It was considered not appropriate to derive an exact PT value from the submitted information. However the TER is >5 even without PT refinement and hence the risk to medium herbivorous mammals is considered as low. The suggested PT refinement for wood mouse was not agreed. The experts concluded that the submitted information is not sufficient to derive a robust quantitative PT refinement. The use of interception factors for residues on arthropods was also rejected. The suggested PD refinement was accepted. The resulting long-term TER of 3.9 is below the trigger of 5 indicating the need for further refinement of the risk assessment. A new long-term risk assessment for wood mouse was submitted by the applicant and assessed by the rapporteur Member State in addendum 4(not peer-reviewed).The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low as well as the risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water. Algae and Lemna gibba were the most sensitive tested organisms. In order to detect long-term effects on fish a 28 d prolonged toxicity test, an early life stage test and three full life cycle tests were performed in order to investigate potential endocrine effects. A new test with Lemna gibba was perfumed and evaluated in addendum 2. The experts agreed to the assessment of the rapporteur Member State. The endpoint (7d EbC(50) = 0.0043 mg a.s./L) derived from standard test conditions should be used in the risk assessment. The endpoint derived from the test system with sediment present was considered as not being of direct use in the risk assessment since epoxiconazole partitions rapidly to the sediment and thus reducing the exposure of free floating Lemna fronds. The TERs were above the trigger of 10 in only 2 FOCUS step3 part scenarios (D4 pond, D5 pond) out of 9. No full FOCUS step 3 scenario resulted in TERs above the trigger. The available full life cycle studies with fish were discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the latest study where fish were exposed to a single peak of epoxiconazole could be used in the risk assessment. The experts agreed that a NOEC of 0.03 mg a.s./L can be used in the risk assessment. The effect observed on male vitellogenin levels (NOEC = 0.012 mg a.s./L) was considered as not relevant since it did not affect the reproductive performance of the tested animals The long-term TERs for fish were above the trigger of 10 for all 9 FOCUS part scenarios as well as the TERs calculated with time weighted PECsw and the lower long-term endpoint for fish (NOEC of 0.01 mg a.s./L) which was based on effects on growth in one of the fish full life cycle tests conducted under flow-through conditions. Epoxiconazole was of similar toxicity to algae when formulated but was significantly more toxic to fish. The acute TERs for fish were above the trigger of 100 in the FOCUS step3 part scenarios D4 (pond) and D5 (pond). In the part scenario D4 (stream) a TER of 99 was calculated which is close to the trigger of 100. Taking into consideration that part of the active substance reach the surface water via drainage and run-off and thus not as the intact formulation the rapporteur Member State concludes that the acute risk to fish from the formulation BAS 480 13 F to fish is addressed for the full FOCUS scenario D4 (pond and stream). EFSA agrees to the opinion of the rapporteur Member State. The risk of bioaccumulation (BCF = 70) was assessed as low. The metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and BF480-entriazole were less toxic to aquatic organisms and the risk posed to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the representative uses in cereals. The TERs for sediment dwellers was calculated as 5.3 and 40.3 (depending on the test system from which the endpoint was derived). Overall it is concluded that the aquatic risk assessment needs further refinement and/or risk mitigation such as no-spray buffer zones. The acute risk of epoxiconazole to earthworms is low but the first tier long term TER values were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. Field studies were conducted to assess the effects of continued use of epoxiconazole on earthworm populations in treated fields and also a terrestrial model ecosystemstudy. The presented studies had some limitations but the long-term risk to earthworms and soil dwelling arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated if all the available information is considered together The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance buprofezin (notified active substance),2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.128r,"Buprofezin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR with the title buprofezin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 2 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2007 and in December 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on tomato, lettuce and citrus. Full details of the gap can be found in the attached end points. It should be noted that only the use as an insecticide has been considered during the peer review process, the acaricide use has not been considered. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Applaud 25 WP"", a wettable powder formulation (WP). It was concluded during the peer review process that the name buprofezin can not be used for this active substance. Adequate methods are available to monitor NNI-750 in all matrices. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-methodslike the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 are not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, the suspensibility and wettability results were poor and a sprayability study was requested. In mammals, NNI-750 acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity is low (oral and dermal LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air /4h). NNI-750 is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser. Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are liver and thyroid, showing increased weights and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day while in dogs, the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.90 mg/kg bw/day while in mice, it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day. Genotoxicity of NNI-750 was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage once daily for two consecutive days. The Panel considered NNI-750 non genotoxic and the recent in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on NNI-750 and concluded that NNI-750 is not carcinogenic in rats or mice. NNI-750 did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day f and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively),It was agreed not to propose any classification. NNI-750 does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals. The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24 month study in rats, with an SF of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with an SF of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40%. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying an SF 100. The operator exposure was below the AOEL-value for tractor mounted spraying with personal protective equipment for tomato and citrus calculated with the German model. For hand-held application exposure was under the AOEL with PPE for tomato outdoors (UK-POEM) and in glasshouse, as for lettuce (Dutch model), and for citrus (German model). The bystanders showed estimated exposure levels below the AOEL (<15%) for both applications on tomato and citrus. Worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomato or lettuce in glasshouse or tomato outdoors. Instead, exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus. The metabolism of NNI-750 in plants has been elucidated. The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue. Minor plant metabolites were identified. Their structures differ significantly from that of NNI-750 and their toxicological properties have not been sufficiently investigated. Also under processing conditions degradation products are formed with unknown toxicological potential. Therefore, although a residue definition can be proposed for monitoring (NNI-750), the residue definition for risk assessment has not been set. For this reason a consumer risk assessment is currently not possible. A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted. No residues are expected in animal commodities. In soil under aerobic conditions NNI-750 exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51% applied radioactivity (AR) after 90-98 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (<5%AR) metabolites were formed. NNI-750 exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of NNI-750 was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems NNI-750 degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment forming the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF-10)2 in water (max. 12%AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for NNI-750 at steps 1-3 and for citrus steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite NNI-750 sulfoxide (BF -10) appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by NNI-750 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for the outdoor uses assessed in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. An assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended protected (glasshouse) uses with higher rates and numbers of applications than in outdoor uses is not available, though the potential for groundwater exposure from these uses is also likely to be low. The acute toxicity of NNI-750 is low to birds and mammals Following the principles of SANCO/ 4145/2000 the acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals were assessed to below. For the small herbivorous mammal in citrus an interception of 70% was taken in to account to reach a TER-value above the Annex IV trigger. Low risk is foreseen for earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals, as the risk to birds and mammals ingesting contaminated drinking water is also considered too be low. NNI-750 is as very toxic to aquatic organisms. TER values for use in tomatoes indicate low risk without any risk mitigation. Buffer zones of 20 m are required for use in citrus to identify low risk. Further data are needed to address the risk to sediment dwelling organisms from NNI-750. NNI-750 is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish. Low risk was identified for all other non-target organism groups, except for a data gap on a reproduction test with Collembola, to address the risk of use in citrus.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance napropamide,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.140r,"Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Devrinol SC 450"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC) registered under different trade names in Europe. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. For surface water the supplied method does not have a LOQ that is low enough and therefore a new data gap has been identified. In addition to this it should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised and therefore further methods could be required in the future. Due to various reasons the minimum purity of the active substance and the impurity specification can not be concluded on. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed, as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid trough urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as parent compound. Napropamide has low acute toxicity and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. Critical effect observed through short term and long term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but three in vivo tests were all negative. So, overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; no adverse effect on fertility or on reproductive parameters was observed either, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in the rabbit which could not be ruled out from being a substance related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. Relevant short term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dog and 90-day oral study in rat, and the overall relevant long term NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year, rat studies. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day considering an assessment factor of 100 and no acute reference dose is allocated. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL if personal protective equipment (PPE) is used. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders derived from napropamide applications. Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound on a provisional basis. Further information is needed to conclude on the toxicological relevance of 3 metabolites which are not covered by the toxicological studies performed with the parent compound. Supervised residue trials confirmed that MRLs can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01 mg/kg) for all representative uses. Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days. Provisionally, no risk for the consumer has been identified. In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming the minor non transient soil metabolite NOPA(2) (accounting for a maximum of 5.8% of applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1%AR in 20 degrees C incubations) which exhibits moderate persistence. Note the database is limited and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of both napropamide (southern European field studies) and NOPA. Mineralisation of 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 13.2 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased). In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.6 AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are not available so the risk assessment to aquatic organisms is not finalised. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low under the more northern European geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However further field DT50 reflecting southern European conditions are required before the groundwater exposure assessment for parent napropamide can be finalised. For the metabolite NOPA further soil DT50 and kinetic formation fraction data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non relevance assessment is triggered and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view NOPA is not relevant, but biological screening data against target plants and a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non relevance of NOPA could be finalised. The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses evaluated. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.6 was below the trigger of 5 for the use in tomato. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low because the endpoint (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to birds from secondary poisoning for earthworm-eating birds was assessed as low. The TER values were in the range of 46-103 indicating some margin of safety. The risk assessment the Southern European use (tomato) can be finalised once updated PECsoil values are available. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals needs to be assessed after reliable PECsw values are established. The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses evaluated, except the risk to insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals for the use in Southern Europe (tomato). The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide. Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR meeting. The endpoints to be used in the risk assessment were discussed since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the endpoints of 0.067 mg a.s./L and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. No conclusion can be drawn on the risk to aquatic organisms since no reliable PECsw values were established. A high risk to aquatic organisms cannot be excluded for the representative uses of napropamide. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the fate experts agreed that the parent as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in Northern Europe but is not finalised for the use in Southern Europe. A high risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was indicated by the available litter-bag study since effects of >10% were observed until one year after application of napropamide and further refinement of the risk assessment is necessary. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flutolanil,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.126r,"Flutolanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.

Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flutolanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 13 June 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co., Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed during a written procedure from November 2006 January 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts from May June 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States from January - February 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide tuber treatment prior to planting. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Moncut 40 SC"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition which is flutolanil only. However, there is a data gap for a confirmatory method for soil, it is noted that a confirmatory method is available and is evaluated in addendum 5 Vol. 3 but it has not been peer reviewed. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available however, it was also shown that the German S19 method could be used for plant matrices, however no ILV data were provided for this method. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. During the mammalian toxicology studies, flutolanil was shown to be orally absorbed up to 70% and rapidly excreted. Its acute toxicity was low, it was not irritating and did not cause skin sensitization. In short term studies, the target organ was the liver in the different species. Flutolanil was considered to have no genotoxic potential, no carcinogenic properties, no teratogenic effects or adverse effects on the reproductive parameters, and no specific neurotoxic properties. It was concluded that the metabolites M-4 and M-2, being the main rat metabolites, had the same toxicological profile than flutolanil The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.09 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.56 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study with correction for oral absorption (70%), and the acute reference dose was considered as not necessary. The dermal absorption values were 0.5% for the concentrate and 5% for the dilution. The operator exposure was below the AOEL with the use of gloves when estimated with the models (UK, German, EUROPOEM). In addition, results of a field study showed that operator exposure is unlikely to be higher than the AOEL. In the same way, the worker and bystander exposure was expected to be lower than the AOEL. Flutolanil plant metabolism has been investigated in potatoes after seed treatment as well as in peanuts and rice after foliar application. A similar metabolic pathway was observed in the 3 crops. Parent flutolanil is a valid indicator for monitoring residues in harvested plant commodities. Two metabolites and their conjugates contribute significantly to the global toxicological burden and need to be considered in the residue definition for risk assessment. Supervised residue trials conducted in Northern Europe are available and support the setting of an MRL of 0.05 mg/kg in potatoes. The appropriateness of this MRL for Southern region should be consolidated by further field data. Livestock exposure to flutolanil residues is low and the establishment of a residue definition and MRLs for animal commodities is not necessary. Transfer of soil residues is limited and no residue above the LOQ in rotational crop is expected. The consumer chronic exposure to flutolanil residues is below 2 % of the ADI In soil under aerobic conditions flutolanil exhibits high to very high persistence and did not form any major (>10% of applied radioactivity (AR)) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 15.9% AR at 116days. The formation of non extractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 27.9% AR after 105 days. Flutolanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil and there was no indication that adsorption was soil pH dependant. In natural sediment water systems flutolanil dissipated slowly from water and partitioned mostly to sediment. Minor amounts (< 10% AR) of degradation products were detected in the whole systems. Predicted environmental concentration in surface water systems due to contamination via drainage were calculated using FOCUS surface water Step 3. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling is based on a 2-year crop rotation period and an incorporation depth in soil of 20 cm. For the representative field uses applied for, the potential for groundwater exposure by flutolanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is low, except for regions with geoclimatic conditions represented by Piacenza and Okehampton FOCUS groundwater scenarios (0.271 and 0.102 mu/L, respectively). Since the representative use of flutolanil as seed treatment for potatoes is not foreseen as a standard scenario in the Guidance Document for Birds and Mammals, the common cane (Grus grus) and the badger (Meles meles) were assessed as alternative relevant focal species to represent potatoes-eating birds and mammals respectively. The risk to birds and mammals can be considered low applying refined FIR and the concentration of 92 mg a.s./kg seed potato in the assessment. As for all other groups of non target organisms the ecotoxicological risk can also be considered as being low for the representative use evaluated.",NA

Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sulcotrione in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 August 2006. The peer review was initiated on 15 September 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded to by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on maize. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mikado"", a suspension concentrate (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. It is noted that the residue definitions for soil and water are not yet finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data gaps have been identified for the specification, and for a new method of analysis for sulcotrione in air. In the mammalian metabolism studies, sulcotrione was rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted after oral administration. It was poorly distributed into tissues and organs, and metabolism was limited. The acute toxicity of sulcotrione was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route. It did not present eye or skin irritation properties; however, it was proposed to classify the active substance with risk phrase R43 ""may cause sensitisation by skin contact"" as a high rate of sensitisation was observed in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sulcotrione is a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor, a key enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway, resulting in increased 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, the proximal tyrosine metabolite and increased blood tyrosine concentration. Male rats were recognised as being more sensitive to sulcotrione and primary effects in short term and long term studies were characterized by corneal lesions and increased liver and kidney weights associated with histopathological findings. Corneal lesions have been shown to be irrelevant for human risk assessment, but liver and mainly kidney effects were considered as sulcotrione-mediated effects (opposed to tyrosinaemia-related effects) and relevant for human risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 3.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study, while after long term exposure, only a LOAEL could be determined, at 0.04 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. Inconsistent results were obtained from genotoxicity studies, some positive in vitro tests were obtained as well as one out of three in vivo micronucleus assays. Higher relevance was given to a negative in vivo UDS assay and it was concluded, based on the weight of evidence, that sulcotrione had no genotoxic potential in vivo. No potential for carcinogenicity was found either. Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same effects in parents, but abnormalities of the urinary tract were increased in pups of both generations, not observed in the first parental animals, and on this basis, a classification with Xn, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The relevant NOAEL (parental) was the dose level of 0.06 mg/kg bw/day, while offspring's NOAEL was 0.6 mg/kg bw/day, no effect on the reproduction or fertility was observed. No developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits when sulcotrione was administered by oral gavage and no neurotoxicity was attributed to sulcotrione administration. A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite CMBA(2), a significant metabolite in plant and the environment, but found only in traces in mammalian metabolism. CMBA was found to be severely irritant to eyes, where it is predominantly formed, at least in the rat, but it did not cause tyrosinaemia and showed to be less toxic than the parent compound. An ADI of 0.2 mg/kg bw/day was set for the metabolite and no relevance was attributed when found in groundwater, even above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of sulcotrione was 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.0006 mg/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 0.1 % for the concentrate formulation and 0.5 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vitro dermal penetration study through human epidermis. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Mikado, at a maximum dose rate of 0.45kg sulcotrione/ha exceeded the AOEL according to the UK POEM, even when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL if PPE as gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coverall and sturdy footwear during application were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with sulcotrione was below the AOEL, even when no PPE was considered. Bystander's exposure was low compared to the AOEL value. The metabolism of sulcotrione in maize was investigated after post emergence application reflecting the representative use supported by the applicant. The metabolic degradation of sulcotrione is essentially focused to the cyclohexanedione ring and the formation of CMBA. CMBA was the only significant metabolite formed and only occurs at significant levels in the forage. The meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 agreed that it should be included in the residue definition for risk assessment. However, the animal metabolism study where CMBA was dosed showed that no significant residues will occur. Therefore the risk assessment would not have changed except that the ADI has been lowered. Revised TMDI calculations showed intakes at 31 % of the ADI. As CMBA is a significant but non relevant metabolite in ground water at a level above 0.75 p.g/L a consumer risk assessment is required. The risk assessment for CMBA gives a highest intake of <0.2 % of the ADI for CMBA. An acute risk assessment was not necessary as no ARM has been set. In soil under aerobic conditions sulcotrione exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.5-73.8 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting up to 26.5 % AR after 120 days. The major metabolite CMBA was detected in soil at maximum level of 60% AR. Sulcotrione and CMBA exhibit very high mobility in soil. Adsorption of sulcotrione is not only determined by the organic carbon content of the soil but at least also by the pH value, which itself correlated to the organic carbon content. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with soil pH. In dark natural sediment water systems sulcotrione degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in the whole system forming the metabolite CMBA (max. 42.2% AR in water and max. 18.6% AR in sediment). The final products of degradation in water-sediment systems were carbon dioxide and bound residues (max 6 and 9% AR after 100 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for sulcotrione at steps 1-3. For the metabolite CMBA appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by sulcotrione above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low for geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. CMBA concentrations (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1 m) are in the range of 0.015 1.462 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 6 out of 8 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for maize and for Hamburg and Okehampton scenarios the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L. The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that CMBA is not relevant regarding groundwater at the expected concentrations. As the fate and behaviour of sulcotrione in the environment was investigated using phenyl-labelled sulcotrione only, the peer review process identified a data gap for an aerobic soil degradation study and for a water-sediment study performed with cyclohexanedione-labelled sulcotrione or for evidence to demonstrate that potential metabolites containing the cyclohexanedione ring are labile. Sulcotrione is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and potential for long range transport may be considered negligible. The first tier acute and short-term TERs for birds and the acute TERs for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10. The first-tier long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5 indicating a potential high long-term risk. The refined risk assessment for medium herbivorous birds resulted in TERs >5 based on residue decline. The experts rejected the suggested PT refinements for insectivorous birds since they were not sufficiently supported by data. A data gap was identified in the expert meeting for the applicant to provide a new refined long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds. A new study was submitted by the applicant and a refined risk assessment based on this study was included by the RMS in the not peer-reviewed addendum 3 from May 2008. The long-term risk to mammals was refined by using residue decline data and the new (higher) long-term endpoint agreed in the experts meeting. Based on the agreed refinements (without PT refinement) the long-term TERs were above the trigger of 5 indicating a low long-term risk to mammals. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water and the risk from the major plant metabolite CMBA to birds and mammals were assessed as low. Sulcotrione is of low acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The lowest endpoint was observed for aquatic plants. The TERs for all groups of aquatic organisms were greater than the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 except for Lemna gibba. One (R4 stream) out of seven FOCUS step 3 scenarios resulted in a TER <10 for Lemna gibba. Risk mitigation measures are required under environmental conditions represented by scenario R4. The metabolite CMBA is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms including Lemna gibba. The Annex VI triggers were exceeded with FOCUS step2 PECsw values. The risk to the standard non-target arthropod indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri was assessed as low. Additional species were tested and no effects of >50% were observed in tests with Poecilus cupreus and Aleochara bilineata. Effects of >50% were observed in tests with Coccinella septempunctata and Pardosa sp at the suggested application rate of 450g sulcotrione/ha. The risk to C. septempunctata was assessed as low in higher tier (extended laboratory) studies. Several extended laboratory studies were conducted with Pardosa sp. After 42 days of ageing the residues still led to a statistically significantly increased mortality. No increased mortality was observed after 56 days of ageing of residues. Although the effects were <50% it is uncertain if recolonisation would occur in a real field situation due to the long persistence of effects. No further information was made available to demonstrate recovery/recolonisation of spiders in the in-field area. The LR50 for Pardosa sp. was calculated as 10.34g a.s./ha which is below the calculated off-field exposure rate of 12.47g a.s./ha indicating a potential high risk for spiders in the off-field area. It was agreed by the experts that risk mitigation measures comparable to a 5m in-field no-spray buffer zone should be applied to ensure that recolonisation of the in-field area is possible from unaffected off field areas. A potential high risk was identified for non-target plants in the off-field area. Risk mitigation measures comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10m is recommended. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative use in maize.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenpyroximate,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.197r,"Fenpyroximate is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on fenpyroximate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 October 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed on during a written procedure in April May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October and December 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was initially finalised on 14 April 2008 (scientific report no. 143 refers) however, following an update to the Residues chapter, the conclusion is revised and re-issued in October 2008. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaricide on grapes, apples, pears and beans. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Kiron"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC). Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. The method of analysis for products of animal origin is only validated for fenpyroximate but the residue definition includes metabolite M-3(2) and therefore a data gap has been identified. Also the residue definition for surface water has not been finalised. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The technical specification could not be concluded on. Regarding the mammalian metabolism, fenpyroximate showed a rapid but incomplete oral absorption and excretion, mainly via faeces; intensive enterohepatic circulation was observed. Fenpyroximate is harmful if swallowed and very toxic by inhalation; eye irritation and skin sensitisation were observed. Based on toxicokinetic properties and different toxicological profile of the substance via oral or inhalation, the meeting of experts concluded that the oral absorption was not representative of the bioavailability of fenpyroximate. Critical effects observed through short term and long term studies were decreased body weight and food consumption. The relevant oral short term NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day, rat study and the relevant inhalation NOAEL is 0.54 mg/kg bw/day from the 4-week study in rats; relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.97 mg/kg bw/day. No genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed; neither reproductive nor developmental parameters were affected by treatment with fenpyroximate. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.02 mg/kg bw considering an assessment factor of 100 for all reference values. Dermal absorption is 7% when handling the concentrate formulation and 24% when handling the spray dilution. Considering the representative uses of Kiron (pome fruits, grapes and beans), the estimated operator exposure exceeds the AOEL according to the UK POEM model; according to the German model calculations, exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop, tractor mounted air blast sprayers (pome fruits and grapes); exposure resulting from high crop, hand held applications (grapes) and field crop, tractor mounted hydraulic sprayers (beans) is below the AOEL when the use of PPE as protective gloves during mixing/loading and gloves, protective garment and sturdy footwear during application is considered. Re-entry worker exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL only if additional protective clothing, as gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers is considered. Bystander's exposure exceeds the AOEL for high crop applications, either tractor mounted or hand held; however for field crop applications (beans), bystander's exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL. The plant metabolism of fenpyroximate is very slow. Only one metabolite, the (Z)-isomer of the active substance (M-1) (3) is included in the residue definition for risk assessment. Further information is required to ensure that the toxicological reference values allocated to fenpyroximate cover its (Z) isomer. Some insufficiencies were identified in the submitted residue trials and further data are required. These deficiencies do not allow proposing an MRL in pome fruits. Studies are also required to investigate the stability of residues under hydrolysis conditions simulating processing. Transfer of soil residues to succeeding crops cannot be excluded for the use evaluated on beans harvested fresh. Based on animal metabolism and feeding studies, one animal metabolite is expected to reach quantifiable residue levels in ruminant liver and kidney. A provisional consumer exposure assessment has shown potential for children exposure in the range of the ARfD for apples, pears and grapes. This may however be reconsidered on the basis of more appropriate residue data for pome fruits. For grapes an option for decision makers is to consider to set the MRL at 0.2mg/kg instead of 0.3mg/kg. In soil under aerobic conditions fenpyroximate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite M-3 (accounting for up to 10.8% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence and the minor non transient metabolite M-11(4) (accounting for up to 8.8%AR). Mineralisation of both the pyrazole and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 17% AR and 51-65% AR respectively after 112 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23.5-58.3 % AR and 21-41%AR respectively after 100-112 days. Fenpyroximate is immobile in soil, M-3 exhibits medium to low mobility in soil whilst M-11 is estimated by quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations to exhibit medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compound was pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems fenpyroximate degraded exhibiting moderate persistence but partitioned relatively rapidly from water to sediment where the major metabolite M-11 was formed. M-3 and M-8(5) were major metabolites in water. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was an insignificant sink for the pyrazole ring radiolabel in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 1.9 % AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a more significant sink representing up to 28 % AR at study end. As no experiment is available where the benzyl ring was investigated a data gap is identified for further information on the fate and behaviour of the benzyl moiety in natural sediment water systems. In laboratory aqueous photolysis studies the Z isomer of fenpyroximate (M1) was a major metabolite. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for fenpyroximate at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites M-3, M-11 and M-8 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by fenpyroximate and its soil metabolites M-3 and M-11 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute and short term risk to birds can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated. The blue tit is accepted as a focal species to refine the risk to insectivorous birds in pome fruit and vines. The tier 1 long-term risk assessment to birds did not identify low risk for any of the uses. Both PD and PT were refined in the risk assessment for orchard use and the PD was refined in the vine scenario. However, the TER did not reach the Annex VI trigger and a data gap is identified to refine the risk assessment for insectivorous birds in both orchards and vines. The yellowhammer and the grey partridge are accepted as focal species to refine the assessment of the risk to insectivorous and herbivorous birds respectively in beans. An acceptable risk was identified with refinements of PD in both scenarios. Based on the first tier risk assessment the acute risk to herbivorous mammals can be considered as low for all representative uses evaluated.. A refined long term risk assessment was needed for all representative uses. In a refined risk assessment the hare is used as focal species in beans and the bank vole is used for the representative uses in pome fruit and grapevine. The risk to mammals in beans can be considered low based on the hare, unattractiveness of crop, and an interception factor of 0.7. The risk to bank vole is considered low for uses in orchards and vine yard, based on a refined PD. The risk from secondary earthworm and fish poisoning is considered low for both birds and mammals Furthermore the risk to birds and mammals from ingestion of contaminated drinking water is considered low. Fenpyroximate is very toxic to aquatic organisms both on an acute as on a chronic time scale. A similar toxicity to fish, algae and aquatic invertebrates was observed. The higher tier toxicity test with fish in the present of sediment was accepted as the relevant endpoint in the aquatic risk assessment. Based on the available data the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low in all FOCUSsw Step 4 scenarios for all uses if sufficient non spray buffer zones are included. Buffer zones of 70 m, 45 m and 20 m are required for pome fruit, vine and bean respectively. The conclusion of the aquatic risk assessment may however change, as a data gap was identified for a fish full life cycle study. The risk from M-3 and M-8 to aquatic organisms is considered low. A BCF of 1601 was experimentally derived for whole fish. The risk to bees is considered low. A data gap is identified for a study to address the in-field risk to A. rhopalosiphi. The in-field risk to T pyri is considered to be low, as the off-field risk is considered to be low for all non-target arthropods if buffer zones up to 5 meter are applied. The risk to earthworms is considered to be low both for the parent and the metabolites M-3 and M-11. Also the risk to non-target marcro-organisms, non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants is considered low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tebuconazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.176r,"Tebuconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tebuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 5 March 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants Bayer CropScience AG and Makhteshim Agan ICC. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May- June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August- September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Folicur EW 250"", an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 250 g/L tebuconazole and ""Raxil S FS 040"" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 20 g/L tebuconazole and 20 g/L triazoxide. As the specifications for the technical materials are currently regarded as provisional, it was not possible to conclude on the equivalence of the different sources. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Mammalian toxicology of tebuconazole was assessed in a series of investigations. Tebuconazole is absorbed rapidly and completely. It is widely distributed and has no potential for accumulation. It is rapidly and extensively excreted and extensively metabolised. Tebuconazole is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant and is not a skin sensitizer. Based on the available data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. Short term toxicity tests have been carried out with rats, rabbits and dogs and the lowest relevant NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/d has been derived from findings of hypertrophy in the adrenals in a 1-year dog study. Tebuconazole is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat study and two 21-month mouse carcinogenicity studies are reported. No tumours were observed in the rat. The liver tumours that were detected in one of the mouse studies were considered not relevant for humans. Tebuconazole did not cause effects on reproduction in a two-generation study. Developmental toxicity of tebuconazole was assessed in a series of tests with rats, mice and rabbits and based on the effects observed through species (malformations, post implantation loss, resorptions) and the absence of overt maternal toxicity, a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI), the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) were set at 0.03 mg/kg bw/(d). When applying Folicur EW 250, exposures estimated in the German model amounted to 138% and 17% (tractor mounted ground boom application on cereals), to 70% and 13% (tractor mounted air blast application on grapes) and to 154% and 13% (spraying upwards with hand held equipment on grapes) of the AOEL without and with personal protective equipment (PPE) respectively. Exposure estimates in the UK POEM exceeded the AOEL in all scenarios. Exposure of re-entry workers after application of Folicur EW 250 using PPE is 52% of the AOEL. Bystander exposure was estimated to account for a maximum of 0.5% of the AOEL. Operator exposure to tebuconazole after application of Raxil S FS 040 was estimated using the SeedTROPEX model and accounted for 52% and to 33% of the AOEL due to seed treatment and loading/sowing respectively. Neither worker nor bystander exposure is expected to occur. Metabolism in plants has been investigated using foliar applications on wheat, peanut and grape and seed application on wheat. Apart from wheat grains and peanut kernels, in all other plant parts investigated unchanged tebuconazole was identified as the main compound and metabolised in a very low extent to the hydroxylated metabolites hydroxy-tebuconazole(2) and tebuconazole-m-hydroxy(3). At the opposite, in grain and kernels, tebuconazole was extensively metabolised to the triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs) (1,2,4-triazole4, triazole alanine(5), triazole lactic acid(6) and triazole acetic acid'.) Considering the recommendations of the PRAPeR experts' meeting 14 on toxicology, concluding that toxicological end points and reference values should be adopted for TDMs, the meeting of experts agreed that separate risk assessments have to be performed for the parent compound and the TDMs respectively and consequently, separate residue definitions have to be to set, one for the parent tebuconazole and the second covering the TDMs (1,2,4-triazole, triazole alanine, triazole acetic acid and triazole lactic acid). Therefore, residue definitions for tebuconazole for monitoring and risk assessment for plant products were provisionally proposed as tebuconazole only. The plant residue definition for TDMs should be reconsidered when a general approach on triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is defined. Supervised residue trials were submitted for the representative uses on cereals and grape where only tebuconazole was analysed for residues. A sufficient number of trials were available to propose MRLs for wheat, rye, barley and oat. Additional data supporting the use on grape in northern EU submitted during the peer review process could not be considered in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. Therefore the MRL for grape was proposed to cover the southern GAP only. Tebuconazole was shown to be stable under standard hydrolytic conditions. Processing studies on barley showed no concentration for most processed fractions and sufficient information was provided to derive transfer factors for white and red wine. The uptake by rotational crops was not expected to lead to tebuconazole residues above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of TDMs was observed. The residue situation in rotational crops should be reconsidered with regard to a global approach on TDMs. Metabolism studies in goats and hens were conducted using tebuconazole only. Therefore, the possible contribution of TDMs metabolites present in animal feed has not been considered. The main metabolic pathway consists in hydroxylation of tebuconazole to hydroxy-tebuconazole and further oxidation to tebuconazole carboxylic acid8 followed by conjugations. Provisionally, the residue definition for animal products for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as ""sum of tebuconazole, hydroxy-tebuconazole and their conjugates expressed as tebuconazole"". As for plants, the inclusion of the TDMs in the animal residue definitions will need to be reconsidered at a later stage when a global EU approach on TDMs is defined. Considering the potential livestock exposure to tebuconazole residues through consumption of treated feed items (cereal grains and straw, grape pomaces being excluded), feeding studies indicate that no measurable residues may be present above the LOQ in the different animals products. Thus MRLs for animal products were proposed at LOQ values. The consumer risk assessment has been performed through the residues of tebuconazole only and according to the residue definitions proposed for plant and animal products. The contribution of the TDMs residues in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin resulting from the use of tebuconazole has not been evaluated and not been taken into account in the consumer risk assessment awaiting the definition of a global EU approach concerning these metabolites which are common for all active substances of the triazole chemical class. Moreover toxicological end points have been set for some of these TDMs but not for triazole lactic acid observed at harvest in peanut kernels. Taking into account the above considerations, the chronic and acute consumer exposures, performed using the proposed MRL for cereals, grape and animal products were found to be below the toxicological values set for tebuconazole. Nevertheless it was concluded that a robust risk assessment related to the compounds of the triazole chemical class needs to take into account the TDMs. In soil under aerobic conditions tebuconazole exhibits moderate to medium persistence forming the soil metabolite 1,2,4-triazole (accounting for up to 9% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was very limited accounting for <0.1-0.4% AR after 58-112 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 14-16 % AR after 58-112 days. Tebuconazole exhibits high to low mobility in soil, 1,2,4-triazole exhibits very high to high mobility in soil. It was concluded that it was unlikely that adsorption of tebuconazole was pH dependent. The adsorption of 1,2,4-triazole was not pH dependent In dark laboratory natural sediment water systems tebuconazole exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 10-20 % AR at 365 days (study end, chlorophenyl ring radiolabel). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink for this radiolabel representing 14-19 % AR at study end. In laboratory natural light exposed indirect photolysis studies the metabolites HWG 1608-lactone(9) and HWG 1608-pentanoic acid(10) were identified as accounting for up to 47% AR (sum of both metabolites that are in a pH dependent equilibrium) with 1,2,4 triazole accounting for up to 14%AR. In outdoor mesocosm and other pond studies (light exposed) where indirect photolysis had the potential to contribute to the breakdown of tebuconazole, it exhibited very high persistence or moderate persistence. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for tebuconazole at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites HWG 1608-lactone, HWG 1608-pentanoic acid and 1,2,4-triazole appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by tebuconazole and 1,2,4triazole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. There is an issue that the rate of degradation of tebuconazole under field conditions was significantly more rapid than in the available (radiolabelled laboratory) experiments where the route of degradation could be investigated. Therefore there is more uncertainty that all potential metabolites that may leach have been assessed, than is usually the case for a substance where the field behaviour of the active substance was not so divergent from the available laboratory study where sufficient samples were taken to identify all potential metabolites. The atmospheric half life estimated for tebuconazole (2.6 days) gives an indication that it may have the potential to be subject to long range transport to areas where it has not been used, via the atmosphere. The acute and short-term TERs for the spray applications in cereals and grapes were greater than the Annex VI trigger of 10 for birds but the long-term risk assessment needed further refinement. The refined risk assessment for herbivorous birds was based on measured residues. Based on the agreed time weighted average factor f(twa) of 0.42 the long-term risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed. The suggested PT values to refine the risk assessment for insectivorous birds were not agreed by the experts since no supporting data were submitted (no radio-tracking studies) and a data gap was identified for further refinement of the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds for the uses in cereals and grapes. The first-tier acute TER for granivorous birds was 7.4. An avoidance study was submitted which gives some indication of avoidance of treated seeds. It was accepted by the experts that under more realistic exposure conditions the acute risk to granivorous birds would be lower than indicated in the first tier risk assessment. However, the submitted data did not allow a reliable quantitative refinement of the risk assessment and a data gap for further supporting data was identified by the experts. The short-term risk to granivorous birds was assessed as low but the longterm risk assessment needed refinement. The quantitative use of the avoidance factor was rejected by the experts. It was agreed that the reproductive risk to birds for the autumn/winter sown cereals is likely to be low since it is applied outside of the breeding season and exposure will be transient due to germination of seeds but a data gap was identified for spring sown cereals. The first-tier acute and long-term TERs for the standard risk assessment scenarios for mammals were above the trigger of 10 for the spray application uses except for herbivorous mammals in grapes. The refinement of the f(twa) of 0.42 was accepted but the measured residues in cereals to refine the RUD value for grass/weeds in grape were not accepted and a data gap was identified in the expert meeting for further refinement of the risk assessment for herbivorous mammals in grapes. The long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals needed refinement. The suggested refinements of PT, avoidance and dehusking factor were rejected by the experts and a data gap was identified. The risk from secondary poisoning and from contaminated drinking water was assessed as low. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of residues in plants for the seed treatment use was assessed as low. No risk assessment was conducted for the second active substance triazoxide in the seed treatment. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the formulation containing a second active substance needs to be addressed further. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for the use as a seed treatment. Risk mitigation measures were required for the spray uses in cereals and grapes. A 5 m no-spray buffer zone was sufficient in most FOCUS step 4 scenarios for the spray application in cereals and in half of the scenarios for the application in grapes. Risk mitigation comparable to a 5 m no-spray buffer zone was not sufficient for environmental conditions represented by the run-off scenarios R1(stream), R3 and R4 for the spray application in cereals and R1(stream), R2, R3, R4 for the use in grapes. The risk from the metabolites HWG 1608-pentanoic acid, HWG 1608-lactone, 1,2,4-triazole to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. The risk to non-target arthropods was assessed as low for the seed-treatment use. However uncertainty remains with regard to reproductive effects on predatory mite species for the spray application uses and a data gap was identified in the experts' meeting. The risk to bees, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Tetraconazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.152r,"Tetraconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tetraconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 5 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant ISAGRO S.p.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March- April 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June - July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Eminent 40 ME"", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 40 g/L tetraconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor tetraconazole residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water; however additional ILV and confirmatory methods are required. There is no acceptable monitoring method for air. Mammalian toxicology of tetraconazole has been assessed in a series of tests. It is absorbed rapidly orally to an extent of about 80%. It is widely distributed in the body. It does not accumulate and is excreted rapidly and completely. It is extensively metabolised. Tetraconazole is of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant and has no skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. In several short-term dietary studies liver and kidneys were the target organs of toxicity (the lowest NOAEL of 2.95 mg/kg bw/d was found in dogs). Tetraconazole is not genotoxic. In a chronic rat study liver effects and at higher doses also effects on bones and incisors (fluorosis) and thyroid tumours were seen. In a carcinogenicity study with mice liver tumours were observed. Neither the thyroid tumours in rats nor the liver tumours in mice were considered relevant for human risk assessment. In a two-generation study dystocia and prolonged gestation periods were observed in dams and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R62 ""Harmful; Possible risk of impaired fertility"" was proposed. In a developmental study with rats extra ribs, hydrourether and hydronephrosis occurred in the pups and classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.004 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was fixed at 0.03 mg/kg bw/d and the ARfD was set at of 0.05 mg/kg bw. Using the worst case scenario of all suggested uses for preparation EMINENT 40 ME (tractor mounted/trailed boom sprayer; hydraulic nozzles on sugar beet and wheat) the calculated exposures were 305.13% and 48.17% and 51.26% and 39.56% with and without PPE (personal protective equipment) respectively of the AOEL in the UK POEM and in the German model. Estimated maximum exposure using worst case scenarios amount to 5.5% of the AOEL for bystanders and to 28% of the AOEL for re-entry workers. The metabolism of tetraconazole in plants was investigated upon foliar application to wheat, sugar beet and grapes and in carrots, lettuce and wheat planted as succeeding crops. Based on the studies a residue definition including tetraconazole and the triazole derivative metabolites (triazole alanine, triazole acetic acid) has been provisionally established. A final plant residue definition for risk assessment is pending the clarification on the toxicological properties of metabolite triazole hydroxypropionic acid. This metabolite had not been identified in metabolism studies with other triazole pesticide compounds assessed in the peer review. The nature of the residue is not altered by processing. From processing studies transfer factors to juice, wine and dry apple pomace could be derived. A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are only available to cover the representative uses in wheat and sugar beets in all Europe and hence MRLs can be proposed for these crops. The representative uses in grapes and apples were initially not supported by residue trials matching the notified GAP criteria. Trials submitted during the peer review process could not be considered in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. Uptake of soil residues by rotational crops is not expected to lead to residues of tetraconazole per se above the LOQ. In contrast, a significant uptake of triazole derivative metabolites is expected, but the available field studies were not considered sufficient to address residues in following crops. Hence a data gap for a new field rotational crop study has been set. Feed commodities may represent a significant source of exposure to tetraconazole residues for animals. Metabolism studies in lactating goats and laying hens are available, and based on the metabolic pattern in animal tissues a residue definition was proposed. However, due to data gaps the livestock dietary intake estimates cannot be finalised and thus appropriate MRLs for animal products can currently not be proposed. The consumer risk assessment for the notified representative uses can currently not be finalised. Excluding the uses on apples and grapes and only considering residues of tetraconazole alone, the RMS has submitted a provisional and none-peer reviewed chronic and acute consumer risk assessment indicating consumer exposure being below the toxicological reference values for tetraconazole. A robust conclusion on the consumer risk will only be possible when the identified data gaps are addressed and sufficient data and information regarding the assessment of triazole derivative metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, and products of animal origin is available. Degradation of tetraconazole in soil under dark aerobic laboratory conditions was negligible. Photolysis of tetraconazole in soil was negligible. Degradation of tetraconazole was also investigated in three soils under aerobic outdoor conditions, exposed to sunlight. The applicant attributed degradation to a combined effect of photochemical and microbial degradation. RMS considered the reliability of the study doubtful since no clear mechanism may explain degradation. The experts considered that further experiments investigating effect of higher temperatures in dark under controlled moisture conditions and indirect aqueous photochemical studies could help to understand the mechanism of degradation prevailing in the environment. Therefore, a data gap was identified for these additional studies. Dissipation of tetraconazole under field conditions was investigated in five sites (4 in Germany and 1 Northern Italy). In the five soils dissipation followed biphasic behaviour. Tetraconazole was high to very high persistent during the second phase. The meeting of experts agreed that the field half lives cannot be used in FOCUS modelling with the current lack of understanding of the mechanism causing loss. For PEC soil the meeting of experts agreed that the longest second phase field DT50 of 1688 d should be used. Potential accumulation of tetraconazole may not be excluded since about 20 40 % AR remains as tetraconazole one year after application. Assuming yearly application and tillage, EFSA calculated a plateau background concentration over the 20 cm horizon after 36 years and peak concentration after last application. Tetraconazole is low mobile in acidic soils. Adsorption / desorption of potential metabolites M 14360-acid and TAA were investigated in different studies. Metabolite M 14360-acid may be considered high to very high mobile in soil and TAA very high mobile in soil. Potential metabolite M 14360-alcohol may be considered very high mobile in soil. A two years lysimeter study with two soil monoliths was performed in Switzerland. Product containing labelled tetraconazole was applied the first year. No product was applied the second year. Residue leachate concentrations observed were 0.53 0.54 mu g / L and 0.27 mu g / L parent equivalents for the first and second year respectively. The two major fractions were M11 (47 % - 66 % of radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.11 - 0.18 1.1 mu g/L) and M10 (15 - 21 % of the radioactivity in the leachate; corresponding to 0.03 - 0.08 1.1 mu g/L). A data gap was identified for the characterization of tetraconazole lysimeter metabolites M10 and Mll and to address its potential for ground water contamination. Tetraconazole is stable to hydrolysis and is not expected to be degraded by photolysis in water. Tetraconazole is not readily biodegradable. A dissipation study of tetraconzole in two water/sediment systems under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C is available. Degradation only occurs in the sediment by formation of non extractable residue. Virtually no degradation product was observed. Mineralization was negligible over the duration of the study (100 d). Tetraconazole was very high persistent in both systems (DT50 whole system = 310 372 d). New PEC SW values calculated according FOCUS SW and FOCUS kinetics were presented in the Addendum 1 to the DAR. These PECSW are based on FOCUS SW Step 2 and were agreed by the meeting of experts. However, some MSs may require Step 3 calculations. With respect to PECSED a data gap to address the potential accumulation of tetraconazole in the sediment was identified. FOCUS GW calculations presented for the parent compound in Addendum 2 were agreed by the meeting of experts. None of the uses and scenarios simulated resulted in 80th percentile annual average leachate concentration above the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L. For the metabolites the meeting of experts did not agree on the calculations presented. Lysimeter metabolite Mll exceed 0.1 mu g parent eq / L the year of application and the subsequent year. Lysimeter metabolite M10 reach concentrations slightly below the trigger (0.08 mu g parent eq / L) the year of application; since the substance has been applied only one season, it may not be excluded that this metabolite also exceeds the trigger of 0.1 mu g parent eq / L when tetraconazole is applied in successive seasons. On basis of the vapour pressure (1.8 10(-4) Pa) and the water solubility (196 mg /L) a Henry's Law constant of 3.6 . 10(-4) Pa m(3) mol(-1) was calculated. Half life in the troposphere due to photochemical reaction with OH. radicals was calculated to be of 1.16 d. The acute risk assessment to insectivorous birds in orchards and sugar beets indicated a low risk, where as the acute risk to insectivorous birds in cereals and herbivorous birds in sugar beets was assessed to be high and calls for further refinements. The short-term risk to birds from all intended uses was considered to be low, whereas the long-term risk to birds from all intended uses was found to be high. A refined long-term risk assessment for birds for all intended uses was required, taking into account the recommendations from the expert meeting. Only the long-term risk assessment to mammals was provided in the DAR, as the acute toxicity endpoint for mammals was found not to be valid by RMS. However, the mammalian toxicity experts agreed that the acute study was valid, and EFSA subsequently calculated acute TER values for mammals The risk was found to be low for all uses. The long-term risk assessment to mammals indicated a low risk to insectivorous mammals from use in cereals and a high risk to herbivorous mammals from uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples. Refinements were required to address the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals for uses in sugar beets, grapes and apples. The risk assessment for secondary poisoning indicated a low risk to fish eating birds and mammals and earthworm-eating mammals. The risk to earthworm-eating birds was found to be high and further refinements were required. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low for birds and mammals. A data gap to address the risk for potential endocrine effects on birds was identified. Tetraconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, acute and chronic TER values were far above the Annex VI trigger for all organisms included in the aquatic risk assessment, based on FOCUSsw Step 2 South European calculation for the worst case sugar beet application. A data gap was identified for the applicant to address the potential risk of endocrine disrupting effects in fish. Standard glass plate tests were provided for Aphidius rhopalosiphi, Typhlodromus pyri, Crysoperla carnea and Poecilus cupreus. No effects were found in the two latter species. The study with T pyri was considered insufficient to address the risk due to high escape rates during the study. Even though in-field and off-field HQ indicated at low risk to A. rhopalosiphi, reproductive effects above 50% were derived in extended laboratory study with A. rhopalosiphi at exposure rates comparable to infield uses. Aged residue studies, however, indicated that the effects on mortality and reproduction never exceeded 50% even at day 0 of ageing. Field studies covering all intended uses indicated a low risk to T pyri. The expert meeting agreed to require an extended lab study (with fresh residues) with T pyri to conduct an off-field risk assessment in order to see if the off-field risk to mites/spiders will be addressed also for species with longer reproductive cycles than T pyri (i.e. species with lower capacity to re-colonise the in-field area). The formulation Eminent 125 EW had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test with worst a case application rate The risk from tetraconazole to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. As uncertainties remains for potential soil metabolites, no final conclusion can be drawn for the risk from metabolites to aquatic organisms, earthworms, soil non-target micro- and macro organisms.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance calcium phosphide,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.183r,"Calcium phosphide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EUCommission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on calcium phosphide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 24 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Chemische Fabrik Wiilfel GmbH. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a rodenticide and talpicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Polytanol"", a gas generating product (GE), containing 180 g/kg calcium phosphide. The gas phosphine that is produced is the true active ingredient. Given the nature and notified use of the product no residues can occur in plants or products of animal origin and therefore methods of analysis are not required. Methods for phosphine in soil are not required as the DT90 in soil is < 3 days for phosphine. A method is available for phosphine in water but a confirmatory method has been identified as a data gap. It should be noted however, that there is a confirmatory method in the aluminium and magnesium phosphide DAR. The method of analysis for air did not have a low enough LOQ and a data gap was identified. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the active substance was not agreed and there is a data gap for a new specification in line with the 5 batch study. There are also some outstanding issues with an impurity method and some physchem properties. The mammalian toxicology of calcium phosphide was assessed in a series of tests. When coming into contact with moisture calcium phosphide decomposes to calcium hydroxide and phosphine which is the toxicologically active and relevant component for the assessment of mammalian toxicology of calcium phosphide. Calcium phosphide is classified as R29 ""Contact with water liberates toxic gas"" and R32 ""Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas"". Phosphine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. It is widely and evenly distributed in the body and has no potential for accumulation. Phosphine is excreted as such via expired air or with the urine in the form of hypophosphite or phosphate. Calcium phosphide is very toxic by the oral and inhalation route and harmful by the dermal route. It is a skin and a strong eye irritant but not a skin sensitiser. Based on data on acute toxicity a classification as Xi; R38 ""Irritant; Irritating to skin"", Xi; R41 ""Irritant; Risk of serious damage to eyes"", T+; R28 ""Very toxic if swallowed"", Xn; R21 ""Harmful in contact with skin"" and T+; R26 ""Very toxic by inhalation"" is proposed. A short term NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d for phosphine (the highest dose tested, no adverse effects observed) was derived from a 90-day rat inhalation study. Calcium phosphide is not genotoxic. In a 2-year inhalation study with rats a NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d was established for phosphine which was the highest dose level tested since no adverse effects were observed. A mouse carcinogenicity study was not carried out and not considered necessary based on the toxicity profile of the substance (lethality anticipated at low doses). In an inhalation developmental study with rats (a rabbit study was not provided) no specific developmental effects were observed and an overall NOAEL of 1.9 mg/kg bw/d was set based on mortality occurring in dams. Effects on reproduction have not been assessed but are not anticipated, based on the toxicity profile of the substance. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) have been set at 0.030 mg/kg bw/d. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 0.051 mg/kg bw. The corresponding values for phosphine are 0.011 mg/kg bw/d (ADI and AOEL) and 0.019 mg/kg bw (ARfD). Based on an estimation of operator exposure when applying calcium phosphide in rodent burrows maximum exposure levels amounted to 63% of the AOEL for operators. For workers and bystanders, however, the actual exposure levels will be lower. Due to its physico-chemical properties and the envisaged use, no specific studies to evaluate the metabolism and distribution in plants have been submitted. In contact with soil moisture, calcium phosphide is rapidly hydrolysed to produce phosphine (PH3) and calcium hydroxide, this decomposition depending mainly on temperature and soil/air humidity. After application, the major part of phosphine is volatilised, diluted in air and oxidised to phosphorous oxyacids or re-adsorbed onto soil, and no significant uptake of phosphine by plant is expected. Therefore the setting of a residue definition in plants following the use of calcium phosphide as a soil fumigant to control rodent and non-rodent species was considered as not required by the meeting of experts, and no MRLs for plant and animal commodities were proposed. When placed in animal burrows (i.e. the soil environment) calcium phosphide will rapidly hydrolyse producing phosphine gas and calcium salts. The phosphine gas produced, which was shown to exhibit very low to low persistence, will volatilise to the atmosphere or adsorb to soil and be converted to phosphate anions. Any phosphine gas that reaches the upper atmosphere will be subject to indirect photooxidation to phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid that would be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition. The rate of indirect photooxidation of phosphine measured was rapid enough to indicate that phosphine will not be subject to long range atmospheric transport. The potential for groundwater exposure of calcium phosphide and phosphine was assessed as low from the applied for intended uses. There is a potential for surface water exposure by phosphine gas when treated target organism burrows are adjacent to surface water (via movement in the gas phase). A data gap was identified to better characterise this exposure potential. Due to the representative use (applied directly into the burrow systems), the exposure to non-target species was considered to be only local. On the basis of the potential exposure of surface water to phosphine where the target organism burrows are adjacent to water bodies, a data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic organisms and therefore to provide valid studies. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non target macro- and micro- organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was expected to be low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Flurprimidol,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.151r,"Flurprimidol is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March April 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Topflor"", a micro-emulsion (ME) containing 3.8 g/1 flurprimidol. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues. There is no agreed specification. A critical area of concern was raised by the experts in mammalian toxicology on the lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies. In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration; it was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body; excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 ""harmful if swallowed"", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short term and long term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure. Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive endpoints for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity; accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 ""may impair fertility"", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone; accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure (AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 10 % for the concentrate formulation (default value, taking into account that measurements were available in an in vivo monkey study with the active substance) and 100 % for the in-use spray dilution (default value for no data). The level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation Topflor exceeded the AOEL, even when the use of protective clothing was considered, according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with flurprimidol exceeded also the AOEL, even after only one application and when the use of gloves was considered. Bystander's exposure was not relevant for this type of use. No data was submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative uses of flurprimidol in containerized ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock animals Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in these notified uses. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, possibly by appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative uses. All fate and behaviour into the environment studies available have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring. The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment is very limited. Data on the route of degradation in soil is insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available shows that flurprimidol is medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 98 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions (no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid (DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for aquatic environment in case exposure could not be completely excluded from the use proposed. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential ground water contamination was precluded from the representative use proposed if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review; however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this is restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of soil used and residues of plants. The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in greenhouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in greenhouse. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm and fish eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the proposed use if the use is restricted to high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the greenhouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology greenhouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment. The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of greenhouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cyromazine,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.168r,"Cyromazine is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cyromazine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 31 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 6 November 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July- August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Trigard 75 WP"", a wettable powder (WP) containing 750 g/kg cyromazine. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin, and environmental matrices. In the mammalian metabolism studies, cyromazine was rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted after oral administration, metabolism was poor, no potential for bioaccumulation was observed. Acute toxicity of cyromazine was low either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; it did neither present eye or skin irritation nor skin sensitization properties according to a Magnusson and Kligman test. The main effect observed upon short term and long term exposure was decreased body weight; the relevant short term NOAEL was the dose level of 5.74 mg/kg bw/day from the one-year dog study and the relevant long term NOAEL was the dose of 6.5 mg/kg bw/day from the oncogenicity study in mice. No evidence of genotoxic or carcinogenic potential was found. Cyromazine did not produce any effect on the reproductive performances or fertility up to the highest dose tested; increased incidence of skeletal malformations and variations were associated with clear maternal toxicity. Two plant/environmental metabolites were assessed for their relevance, 1-methyl-cyromazine and melamine; both metabolites were identified in the rat metabolism studies as well. Based on an open literature review, melamine was considered not relevant for groundwater according to the guidance document on the assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater2. The toxicity of the metabolites is covered by the reference values of the parent compound. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for cyromazine was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, supported by the 2-year study in mice and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the same 1-year dog study and safety factor of 100; and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.1 mg/kg bw based on the maternal effects observed in the developmental toxicity study in rabbit and a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was 0.7 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 2 % for the in-use spray dilution. The level of operator exposure calculated for outdoor and glasshouse uses was estimated to be below the AOEL even when no protective personal equipment (PPE) are worn. Worker exposure was calculated to be also below the AOEL without the use of PPE; estimated bystander exposure was negligible. Metabolism in plants has been investigated using C-14-cyromazine labelled on the triazine ring in celery, lettuce and tomato representing two groups of plants: leafy and fruit crop groups. These studies suggest a simple metabolic transformation leading to the dealkylated product melamine Taking into account the conclusion of the meeting on mammalian toxicology considering that melamine has the same toxicological profile as the parent, the residue definition for risk assessment was defined as ""cyromazine parent compound and melamine expressed as cyromazine"" and the residue definition for monitoring was limited to ""cyromazine parent only"", these residue definitions being set for fruit and leafy crops only. Though it was mentioned that consumer exposure to melamine may be possible through other sources (plastics, colorant, flame retardants, veterinary drugs...), the decision to include the melamine metabolite in the residue definition was taken with regard to the high melamine residue levels observed in the treated crops. After the meeting the RMS proposed conversion factors for leafy and fruit crops in order to take into account the melamine metabolite that was included in the residue definition for risk assessment. These conversion factors have to be considered as provisional since they have not been peer reviewed. Based on the US rotational crop studies performed with unlabelled cyromazine and exaggerated application rates, it was concluded that no significant residues of cyromazine or melamine are expected in practice in rotational crops. A residue definition for animal products was discussed, but the experts were not confident in proposing a residue definition for animal products, since animal dietary burden remains unknown and the validity of the animal metabolism study performed with the parent compound only remains uncertain. The final conclusion was that at this stage, there is no need to propose a residue definition and to set MRLs for animal products based on the intended uses on lettuce and tomato. A residue data set was available to propose MRLs for tomato and lettuce. However, after the meeting and considering the conversion factor for risk assessment and the ARfD value set by the meeting on mammalian toxicology, the initial MRL of 10 mg/kg proposed for lettuce and based on the indoor GAP was shown to be unsafe for the consumer (IESTI 325% of the ARfD). Although it was not discussed during the meeting and it has not been peer reviewed, the EFSA in agreement with the RMS, was of the opinion that an MRL of 3 mg/kg based on the outdoor residue trials would be appropriate for cyromazine on lettuce. Taking into account this proposal, no acute concern is observed, the IESTI using the EFSA model being 94% of the ARM. It must be pointed out that the consumer exposure was only considered through the representative uses of cyromazine as a plant protection product on lettuce and tomato. However this active substance is also used as a veterinary drug and consumers may additionally be exposed to the melamine metabolite through other sources since this molecule is present in many domestic materials (plastics, colorants, flame retardants....). A potential additional exposure to cyromazine and melamine is then expected. In soil under aerobic conditions cyromazine exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the [U-C-14]-traizine radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.7-7.3% AR after 120-121 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 7-54 % AR after 120-126 days. The major metabolite melamine was formed up to 74.5% AR after 120 days. This metabolite exhibits low to moderate persistence in soil. Another metabolite, identified as NOA 435343 was measured at max 10.7% at 60d in one soil metabolism study. However, an environmental exposure assessment for this metabolite is not available. The soil exposure assessment (PEC) and plateau concentrations calculation for melamine have not been finalised. Cyromazine exhibits very high to low mobility in soil and there was no indication that adsorption of cyromazine was pH dependant. Melamine can be classified as high to medium mobile in soil, with a clear dependence of adsorption on soil pH. In dark natural sediment water systems cyromazine partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment, where it degraded exhibiting high persistence. No metabolite accounted > 2.5% AR at any sampling time. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 8 % AR at 103d. Unextracted sediment residues were another sink representing 12-13 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments at steps 3 and 4 are not available for both cyromazine and melamine The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by cyromazine and its metabolites above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L with the appropriate input parameters needs to be finalised. Based on the estimated photo-oxidative degradation rate in the atmosphere of 4.25 days, a potential for long range aerial transport was identified. The representative uses of cyromazine are applications to lettuce and tomatoes. The First tier risk assessment resulted in an acute and short-term TER value above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating that acute and short term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds was low. However, the TERlt was below the Annex VI trigger value indicating a potential high long term risk to birds. The long term TER for insectivorous birds was revised considering the Yellow wagtail as a focal species, with a refinement diet PD of 17% small insects and 83% large insects. The resulting TERlt values was 16 which was above the Annex VI trigger value, indicating that long term risk is low for insectivorous birds. The refinement for the long term risk to medium herbivorous birds was based on the residue decline in plants. A MAF of 1.3 was used for the refined risk assessment for herbivorous birds. The resulting TERlt was above the trigger values indicating the risk was low. First tier risk assessment for mammals resulted in acute and long-term TER values above the Annex VI trigger values, suggesting a low acute and chronic risk for mammals. The risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated drinking water from surface water or puddles was considered to be low. Based on the information available, cyromazine is proposed to be classified as toxic to aquatic organisms. A potential high risk was indicated with PECsw FOCUS Step 3 values for Chironomus riparius. At FOCUS step 4, including a non-spray buffer zone of 10 m, the TER values for all scenarios were above the Annex VI trigger value. The first tier risk assessment indicated that risk for the relevant soil metabolite melamine was considered to be low for aquatic organisms. Risk mitigation measures were needed to reduce the risk of cyromazine to the aquatic organisms. In case of Annex I inclusion of cyromazine Member States should ask for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment pertinent to national conditions. A data gap has been identified for the submission of a new risk assessment for the aquatic organisms based on the agreed PECsw values. The LD50 from acute oral and contact toxicity tests with the preparation were 186 mu g a.s. /bee and > 200 mu g a.s. /bee, respectively. Hazard Quotients (HQ) were estimated to be 1.6 for the oral exposure and < 1.5 for the contact exposure. As a conclusion a low risk to bees is expected for the use of cyromazine. As cyromazine is an insect growth regulator an additional consideration was given to potential on the bee brood as recommended in the SANCO Guideline 10329/2002. Three higher tier studies had been submitted by the applicant, reporting that cyromazine had an effect on the development of eggs and young larvae into adult worker bees following dosing in sucrose provided directly to the hive. The impact of TRIGARD (R) 75 WP on bee brood development was further investigated in a semi-field tunnel study and a full-scale field study. The experts agreed that the field study should not be considered in the risk assessment, until the applicant submits a position paper on the melon field study including extrapolation from this study to tomato crops in other Member States. With the available information the risk of cyromazine to bee and the bee brood could be considered to be low for lettuce but not for tomato. The higher tier risk assessment indicates that a potential risk to some foliar dwelling non-target arthropods, particularly the predatory mites T pyri and P. persimilis, was identified based on tier II extended lab studies. A high risk was identified for the in-field areas and the RMS proposes to use the aged residue studies to refine the in-field risk assessment. Experts at the PRAPeR 48 meeting had some concerns regarding the study on T pyri which is used to refine the risk in field. Uncertainty remains with regard to the time needed for recovery. Especially for non-flying insects recovery time might be long. If the cyromazine is included in Annex I, mitigation measures should be considered at Member State level to make sure recolonisation is possible. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target macro-organisms from cyromazine was expected to be low. However, a data gap has to be set for a risk assessment for the metabolite melamine to earthworms based on the agreed PEC soil values. Additionally the risk to soil micro-organisms and non target plants was expected to be low. Also the risk of cyromazine to biological methods of sewage treatment is low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Aclonifen,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.149r,"Aclonifen is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aclonifen in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June-July 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a pre emergence herbicide as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Bandar"", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of aclonifen. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The exception to this is the relevant impurity phenol where there is no method to monitor it in the formulation. It was concluded during the peer review process that the specification is not supported and a data gap has been identified. In addition it was considered by the meeting of experts mammalian toxicology that phenol is a relevant impurity. The meeting of experts discussed that as the technical material is a wet cake a TK specification should be required but no conclusion was reached on this in the meeting. Mammalian toxicology of aclonifen was assessed in a series of investigations. Aclonifen is absorbed rapidly to an extent of about 80% and is distributed widely in the body. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and almost completely and it is extensively metabolised. Aclonifen is of very low acute toxicity. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant but has skin sensitising properties. A classification as Xi; R43 ""Irritant; May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed. Short term studies were carried out with dogs, mice and rats and the lowest NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/d was obtained in rats (effects on body weight, liver and kidney). Aclonifen is not genotoxic. Two chronic rat studies and a carcinogenicity study with mice have been carried out. While the thyroid tumours seen in rats and the bladder tumours observed in mice were considered not relevant for human risk assessment the brain tumours seen in the rat could not be dismissed and a classification as Xn; Carc. Cat. 3 R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Aclonifen did not exert specific effects on reproduction and was neither teratogenic in rats nor in rabbits. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.07 mg/kg bw/d. An acute reference dose (ARfD) was not allocated. Operator exposure amounted to 16.1% of the AOEL when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in the German model. When no PPE is worn in the German model and in all scenarios in the UK POEM exposures exceeded the AOEL. Exposure of bystanders and unprotected re-entry workers was estimated to amount to 4.6% and 2.9% of the AOEL respectively. The metabolism of aclonifen was investigated in wheat, peas and potatoes. However in the meeting of experts PRAPeR 45 no conclusion could be reached on the cereal and potato metabolism studies because there were no GAPs for these crops in the representative uses evaluated. So only the pea study was considered further. The pea study is representative of the relevant metabolism group for sunflowers which is the supported crop. This study showed that there are no significant residues in peas or in podded peas the major residue in the vinings was aclonifen. The residue definition for pulses and oilseeds was set as aclonifen only. The rotational crop metabolism study showed that in the majority of crops no significant residues would occur. However, for root and tuber crops it showed that residues could be expected. A data gap was set for a rotational crop residue study. The need for animal studies was not triggered. A goat metabolism study was evaluated in the DAR but the peer review did not conclude on its acceptability. A full set a residue data were available for the north and south of Europe all residues were <0.02 mg/kg at harvest. The consumer risk assessment could not be concluded because of the data gap identified for rotational crops. A risk assessment based on intakes of sunflower showed that the TMDI did not exceed 1 % of the ADI, no acute risk assessment was necessary. The route of degradation in soil under dark aerobic conditions was investigated in two studies in a total of five soils. Albeit the drawbacks identified in these studies, the meeting of experts agreed that the data submitted was enough to satisfy the regulatory requirements. Practically the totality of the extracted radioactivity consisted on parent compound with only very minor metabolites detected. Mineralization was negligible or very low (CO2: 0.7 5.2 % AR). Unextracted soil residue increase continuously up to 40.9 63.7 % AR at the end of the experiments. According the photolysis in soil study, photolysis may contribute slightly to the degradation of aclonifen in soil. No metabolite exceeded 5 % AR. Degradation of aclonifen in soil under anaerobic conditions was investigated in one of the studies presented in the dossier but it was not considered reliable. A data gap, which was considered not essential to finalize the risk assessment of the EU representative uses, was identified by the meeting of experts. Aclonifen may be considered moderate to high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 C (DT50 = 32.2 134 d). Kinetics of all aerobic degradation data was re-evaluated with non linear regression to first order kinetic and values obtained were normalized to 20 degrees C and pF2. Since the report was not available in the updated dossier, the meeting identified a formal data gap for the applicant to incorporate this report (Hardy, I. and Patel, M. 2008) into it. The meeting of experts agreed the end points proposed by the RMS in table 66 of addendum 1. Two field dissipation studies are available in Northern Europe (1 study in Germany, 4 sites) and Southern Europe (1 study in Spain and France, 1 site each). First order half lives between 57 d 195 d were observed in these trials. The two soil accumulation trials performed in Germany were considered not adequate to address the potential accumulation of aclonifen in soil. Accumulated, PEC soil were calculated by the RMS and presented in addendum 1 based on the worst case field half life, annual application of 2400 g/ha and no interception. Plateau steady state was calculated after 10 yr over a mixing layer of 20 cm. Actual and TWA PECs were calculated adding the result of the annual application on a 5 cm mixing layer over the plateau. The calculation was agreed by the experts in the meeting. Aclonifen may be considered practically immobile in soil (K-proportional to = 5318 10612). Aclonifen is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9. The aqueous photolysis study and the subsequent RMS model calculation show that photolysis may contribute in a limited extend to the degradation of aclonifen in the aquatic environment. Aclonifen is not readily biodegradable. Degradation of aclonifen was investigated in one study with two water sediment systems (pH(water) = 6.7 7.5; pH(sed) = 6.8 8.4, OC 3.8 5.7 %, clay 10.54 28.99 %) incubated under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In both water / sediment systems aclonifen steadily partitioned to the sediment and degraded. None of the metabolites observed reached 5 % AR in any of the phases. Mineralization was negligible in both systems (max CO2 = 2.07 % AR) and unextractable residue in the sediment amounted up to 65.6-76.5 % AR at the end of the experiments (180 d). Separated half lives for the water and sediment phases were considered unreliable and not representing true degradation by the experts. The meeting agreed that total system half lives could be used for the risk assessment (DT5o = 17.3 d). New FOCUS PECsw/SED up to STEP 4 (including effect of spray drift and run off mitigation by buffer and vegetative strips) using the agreed input parameters were available in addendum 1. The calculations were agreed for the STEP 3 and the STEP 4 when only spray drift mitigation was assumed. Therefore, only PECsw/SED presented in Table 17 of addendum 1 may be considered peer reviewed for the EU risk assessment. Aclonifen is not considered to pose a risk for contamination of ground water above the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when used according the GAPs for the representative use evaluated. Concentrations in air and transport through air are considered negligible for aclonifen. The acute and short-term first-tier TERs for insectivorous birds and the acute TER for insectivorous mammals exceeded the trigger of 10 but the long-term risk needed further refinement. The refinement of PT was rejected in the experts' meeting since it was not sufficiently supported with data. A data gap was identified to submit a new refined long-term risk assessment for birds and mammals. The long-term endpoint (35 mg a.s./kg bw/d) used in the original risk assessment for mammals in the DAR was discussed in the meeting. Statistically significant effects on body weight were observed at the dose of 35 mg a.s./kg bw/d. The effects were <10% but a reduced fitness and thus adverse effects on populations of wild mammals under realistic environmental conditions cannot be excluded. The experts agreed that the NOEC of 8 mg a.s./kg bw/d should be used in the risk assessment. The risk of secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm-eating mammals needs further refinement. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low since the product is applied to bare soil. The lowest endpoints were observed in studies with fish, algae and higher aquatic plants. The experts accepted the use of 4-day time weighted average PECsw values to refine the risk to higher aquatic plants. The use of time weighted average values was also accepted for growth effects on fish but concerns were raised with regard to the long time interval of 28 days. It was suggested that the time window may be revised at MS level when guidance will be available from the e-link workshop. Effects on hatch success of fish were also observed in the early life stage test. Effects on hatch success can be caused by short exposure peaks. The experts agreed that the NOEC hatch success should be compared to initial PECsw values which lead to TERs significantly below the trigger of 10. However the TERs for algae are lower and the risk to fish would be covered by the risk mitigation required for algae. Even if a no-spray buffer zone of 40 m in combination with run-off mitigation by 80/95% is applied then the TERs are above the trigger in only one full FOCUS step 4 scenario (D5) and in the part scenario R1 (pond). It is noted that the suggested reduction of spray-drift entry exceeds the recommendation of the FOCUS Landscape report and uncertainty remains also with regard to the PECsw following the proposed run-off mitigation. The full scenarios R3, R4 and the part scenario R1(stream) still result in TERs below the trigger of 10. Overall it is concluded that the representative use of aclonifen poses a high risk to aquatic organisms. Brassica napus was the most sensitive non-target plant species tested. It reacted very sensitive under high temperature and high soil moisture growth conditions. Even an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 50 m would not be sufficient to achieve a TER of >5 for the ER50 of 1.12 g a.s./ha for Brassica napus. Under field exposure conditions the observed endpoints were significantly higher. However the experts identified uncertainties with regard to the influence of the weather conditions on the dissipation of aclonifen, the application pattern and actual exposure in the field studies. A data gap was identified in the experts' meeting for the applicant to provide a refined risk assessment for non target plants. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use of aclonifen.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Acetochlor,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.153r,"Acetochlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize, for full details of the GAP please refer to the attached end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""GF-675"" and ""Mon 69447"" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and a 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC). The residue definition for monitoring in plants has not been concluded on. Acetochlor residues in maize can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For Noxamic acid metabolite 68(2) a LC-MS/MS method is available this metabolite can not be analysed by a multi method. For products of animal origin there are no methods available. At this stage it can not be concluded if this is a data gap or not as the assessment for residues is not complete. For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2)3, t-sulfonic acid (7) (4), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (5), s-sulfonic acid (13)(6) and t-norchloroacetochlor (6) (7). For surface/ground/drinking water LC-MS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), tsulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LC-MS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, it should be noted that there are no spectra, analytical methods or storage stability data for the relevant impurities in the technical material. Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat.3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits. The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and ssulfonic acid (13) were considered relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The relative toxicity of the plant and potential surface water metabolite t-norchloro acetochlor (6) in comparison with acetochlor could not be concluded. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For GF-675, the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves. For MON 69447, the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a biomonitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of closed cabins and gloves. Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon a pre-emergence treatment. Total residues in the mature grain were low and did not permit an extensive identification of metabolites. The rate of identification in other maize plant parts was limited and the need for further data was identified, in particular with regard to the nature of the residue in plant parts fed to livestock and in immature maize kernels (sweet corn use withdrawn during the peer review). Also early-post emergence uses are currently not sufficiently addressed by metabolism data. Based on the available data a number of metabolites were identified and some of them are considered toxicological relevant (potential carcinogenicity). Therefore the residue definition was extensively discussed and it was concluded that for risk assessment all compounds forming EMA (34)8 and HEMA (33)(9) on hydrolysis as well as hydroxy-oxamic acid (68), all expressed as acetochlor should be considered for maize grain and preliminary also for rotational crops (the latter restricted to cereal grains, root and tuber crops and leafy crops). The need for further rotational crop data was identified. For monitoring purposes three options for a residue definition were proposed, and risk management consideration is required to decide on the final monitoring definition. Residue trials confirmed that residues in maize kernels, when analysed for the risk assessment residue definition, are below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.05 mg/kg. However, currently insufficient data in terms of quality and magnitude of residues are available to assess the dietary burden of livestock. Consumer exposure estimates therefore only include the exposure from maize grain but don't consider potential exposure from food of animal origin and certain rotational crops. Therefore the consumer risk assessment should be considered as not finalised. It is also noted that there is potential consumer exposure to acotochlor metabolites from ground water used as drinking water, in particular to t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13). A risk assessment showed that the ADI of acetochlor, when applied to the metabolites, might be exceeded only due to the consumption of water containing these metabolites at the level estimated in FOCUS scenarios. In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18%AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8%AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3%AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 4 metabolites was pH dependant. In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1%AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4%AR in water 19.2%AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1p.g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination >0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. It was considered that a lysimeter study would be essential to exclude the potential for the presence of additional metabolites in groundwater. The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However it was not possible to conclude on the reliability of the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds since no summaries of the supporting studies were made available. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from uptake of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for mammals. The risk assessment for uptake of contaminated drinking water was discussed in the expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk cannot be excluded for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite 68 (N-(6-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfonylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of not identified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic waterbodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 lag acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic waterbodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. A new risk assessment was prepared by the RMS in addendum 5 (not peer-reviewed) taking into account the recommendations of the expert meeting. The TERs were below the trigger of 2 for all FOCUS step 3 scenarios. In addendum 6 (not peer-reviewed) TERs were calculated for no-spray buffer zones of 25 and 50m. No full scenario resulted in TERs >2 with a no spray buffer zone of 25m. TERs >= 2 were observed in two full scenarios (D4, D5) out of 8 scenarios if a no-spray buffer zone of 50m is applied but no full scenario achieved TERs >= 3. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low. A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that recolonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low. The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is <100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low. A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m in-field no spray buffer zone are required. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance penconazole,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.175r,"Penconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on penconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 1 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July-August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cucurbits and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Topas 10 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues of penconazole in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of penconazole. A data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for surface water. It is noted that the residue definition for soil and water is provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. It is noted however, that further validation data are required for the impurity method and that there is no supported technical specification. The toxicological studies on the metabolism of penconazole have shown an extensive oral absorption, a wide distribution in the body and an excretion mainly via urine. According to the results of acute oral toxicity testing, the agreed classification was Xn, R22 Harmful if swallowed. The main target organ in short term toxicity studies was the liver, and the dog was the most sensitive species. No genotoxic potential was observed during in vitro or in vivo tests, and no carcinogenicity was observed in rats or mice after long term exposure. In the reproductive toxicity studies, an increased incidence of dystocia was considered as an effect already observed with other triazoles, and to be forwarded to EChA for a decision upon classification (R62?- ""Possible risk of impaired fertility""). Developmental effects were observed in the teratogenicity studies, and the classification Reprotoxic Category 3 R63 Possible risk of harm to the unborn child was proposed by the experts. Several plant metabolites were considered to be of the same or lower toxicity than penconazole. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) were both 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the combined 90-day/1- year dog study. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.5 mg/kg bw based on early bodyweight changes in the rabbit developmental study. These reference values were all derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values were 5% for the dilution and 1% for the concentrate. The exposure estimates in different scenarios (field or greenhouse use) were all below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment. The metabolism of penconazole was tested in grapes, tomatoes and apples where triazole and phenyl labelled compound was applied. The meeting of experts considered that the grape data were not acceptable and they were not considered further. The apple and tomato data were acceptable and showed the same metabolic profile. The main metabolism route is oxidation at the 1, 2 and 3 positions on the alkyl chain. The triazole moiety metabolites are an issue for all the triazole fungicides and will be dealt with in a separate exercise. For completeness, a general data gap was identified for this issue which has been used in other triazole conclusions. No phenyl-ring-only metabolites were seen. The significant residues at harvest consisted of CGA 132465(2), CGA 190503(3), CGA 127841(4) and their glucoside conjugates as well as penconazole. It was agreed that the provisional residue definition for risk assessment (fruit crops only) should be penconazole and free and conjugated CGA 132465, CGA 190503 and CGA 127841 expressed as penconazole. The residue definition for monitoring is penconazole with a conversion factor of 6 between monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions. The residue trial data set was complete for grapes but a data gap for outdoor cucurbits in the North of Europe was identified. The stability of residues was demonstrated in freezer storage for a period of 16 months. Appropriate processing data are available. Two rotational crop metabolism studies conducted at exaggerated rates showed that no significant residue would be expected in rotational crops. No livestock metabolism studies were supplied or required, as according to current guidance the representative crops under consideration are not fed to animals. The chronic risk assessment showed a maximum intake of 2.9 % of the ADI for the French diet using the EFSA model. For the acute risk the highest intake was 13 % of the ARID from the consumption of table grapes for the German diet using the EFSA model. The proposed MRLs are 0.2 mg/kg for grapes and 0.1 mg/kg for cucurbits. In soil under aerobic conditions penconazole exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 179944(5) (accounting for up to 18.9% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 71019(6) (accounting for up to 38.6% of AR) which also exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 65 and 27 % of AR respectively after 546 and 364 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 22 and 47 % of AR respectively after 364 and 336 days. A data gap was identified for the identification/characterisation of the unknown radioactivity Ul found in the aerobic soil degradation up to 17.3% of the applied radioactivity. Penconazole is strongly adsorbed to soils and is unlikely to leach in soil. Column leaching studies have confirmed this, demonstrating that the parent compound is only recovered from the upper layers of the columns. Metabolite CGA 179944 exhibits very high mobility in soil and CGA 71019 exhibits very high to medium mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of penconazole or that of its soil metabolites was pH dependent. Penconazole does not degrade significantly via either hydrolysis or photolysis. The metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 were shown to be stable to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions. The fate of penconazole in the aquatic environment therefore, will be principally determined by adsorption to the sediments and slow degradation therein. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 4.6-8.4% of AR at 678-706 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 18-19 % of AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for penconazole and metabolites CGA 179944 and CGA 71019 at steps 1-2. Additional FOCUSsw calculations for penconazole confirmed that the maximum Step 3 PECs are 85% (water) and 70% (sediment) lower than the Step 2 derived values. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by penconazole, CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low for the intended uses covering only neutral and alkaline soil conditions. In addition, an assessment of the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on vines with highest rates and numbers of applications for some FOCUS scenarios is not available. For unknown Ul, a data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment. A second modelling with FOCUS PEARL model is also necessary. It was concluded that penconazole is unlikely to be subject to long range atmospheric transport as a consequence of its likely indirect photooxidation intermediated transformation (half life estimated at 15.9 hours). The representative uses of penconazole are applications to cucurbits and grapes. The first tier risk assessment indicated that a low risk is expected to birds and mammals. TERs for earthworm eating birds and mammals meet the Annex VI trigger value of 5. The risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated drinking water from surface water or puddles was considered to be low. The meeting agreed with the use of the toxicity data for the triazole metabolites from the report from PRAPeR 13 for the ecotoxicology and from the report from PRAPeR 14 for the mammalian endpoint. The penconazole avian and mammalian databases were reviewed for effects indicative of potential endocrine activity. There are no relevant mediated effects below the threshold established by the current endpoints for the mammals. The expert meeting PRAPeR 48 agrees that some uncertainties remain on potential delayed reproductive effects on birds since these effects are not covered on the basis of the currently stated data requirements of Council Directive 91/414/EEC. More information should be requested at MS level. Based on the information available penconazole is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment indicated a low long term risk to fish and also a low acute risk to aquatic invertebrates, algae and sediment dwelling organisms. However, tier I risk assessment also indicated that there is a high acute risk to fish and a high long term risk to aquatic invertebrates and aquatic plants. The Annex VI triggers for acute and long term risk are met with the PECsw from FOCUS Step 2. The higher tier risk assessment indicated a low risk for all aquatic organisms, except for the long term risk to aquatic invertebrates. However, with FOCUS Step 3 PECsw the TER value was above the Annex VI trigger values. The applicant and the RMS proposed that an appropriate FSDT study was required to address the potential endocrine-mediated effect in DMI fungicides since the FSDT will cover the sensitive time windows with respect to effect triggering and effect manifestation. The member state experts agreed with this proposal and also noted that member states should have the opportunity to ask for an appropriate test to address the endocrine effects. The BCF of 320 was derived from a study with bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus). The first tier risk assessment for metabolites indicated a low acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944. Penconazole is of low toxicity to bees. Hazard Quotients (HQ) for oral and contact exposure were determined to be below the trigger values indicating a low risk for bees. The risk to non-target arthropods was assessed as high for the in-field areas, however a potential for recolonisation from the off field areas had been demonstrated. The acute and chronic TER values for penconazole and for both metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating that the risk to earthworms is low. Penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 were tested with Folsomia candida, and the active substance was tested for effects in a litter bag study. In conclusion, the risk of penconazole and the metabolite CGA 71019 to other non-target macro-organisms was considered to be low. The results of the assessment of ""Topas 10 EC"" as well as the soil metabolites CGA 71019 and CGA 179944 indicate no adverse impact on soil non target organisms. In a preliminary screening test ""Topas 10 EC"" had only a slight effect (< 50 % effect) on seedling emergence and vegetative vigour in 3 monocotyledons and 3 dicotyledons at rates up to 30 g a.s./ha. EFSA notes that the dose used in the screening test, 30 g a.s./ha, has not covered the higher proposed intended uses of 50 g a.s./ha. No inhibitory effects of penconazole to respiration rates of activated sludge were observed up to 100 mg /L.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dimethachlor,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.169r,"Dimethachlor is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dimethachlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 2 May 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Europe Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July-August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on oilseed rape as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Teridox 500 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. As yet it is not clear for the plant method if for the ILV the laboratory was truly independent. Also the residue definition for soil and water are provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available for the active substance to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, there is no method of analysis or storage stability data for the relevant impurity. In general however the specification is not agreed. It was also a concern that the formulation at low temperatures forms crystals. Mammalian toxicology of dimethachlor was assessed in a series of tests. Dimethachlor is absorbed almost completely and moderately rapidly. It is widely distributed in the body and has no potential for accumulation in humans It is excreted moderately rapidly and is completely metabolized. It is of moderate toxicity by the oral and of low toxicity by the dermal and inhalation route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant but a strong skin sensitizer. Based on the available data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" and Xi; R43 ""Irritant; May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" is proposed. In short term tests with rats, mice and dogs the liver was the main target of toxicity and the relevant NOAELs obtained were 2.21 mg/kg bw/d (rat), 10 mg/kg bw/d (dog) and 17.5 mg/kg bw/d (mouse) respectively. Dimethachlor is not genotoxic but can bind to chromatin protein. A 2-year rat and two 18-month mouse studies have been reported. In the rat study a NOAEL of 11.1 mg/kg bw/d was derived based on body weight and liver effects that occurred together with nasal tumours (in males only). These tumours were considered relevant for humans and led to a proposal for classification as Xn; R40 ""Harmful; Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". The pulmonary and liver tumours observed in the first murine carcinogenicity study were considered not relevant for humans. Dimethachlor did not cause effects on reproduction in rats. In rats dimethachlor impaired the ossification in pups at maternally toxic doses while none developmental effects were observed in rabbits. Seven dimethachlor metabolites with a high potential to occur in groundwater are considered as relevant according to guidance document Sanco/221/2000-rev. 10 final on the basis of the available data. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.1 mg/kg bw/d. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was fixed at 0.5 mg/kg bw. In the German model operator exposure amounts to 88% of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn. Re-entry worker and bystander exposure were estimated to be 4.3% (no PPE worn) and 2.2% respectively. The metabolism of dimethachlor was investigated in oilseed rape where phenyl labelled dimethachlor was applied at a rate of 1.5 kg as/ha (1N). At harvest there were no significant residues of dimethachlor or its metabolites and the residue definition defaulted to dimethachlor only. There were a total of 18 residue trials available for the representative crop oilseed rape. Only one positive residue of dimethachlor was detected at 0.05 mg/kg. It was concluded that the residue at 0.05 mg/kg is not a correct result and perhaps was due to a matrix component or sample contamination. As this is the case it was concluded that the metabolites will also not occur at significant levels. Residues were seen to be stable under frozen conditions for a period of 2 years. No processing data were required. For rotational crops the study provided was not accepted and data gap was identified Animal intakes were low and the need for a study is not triggered. All intakes using the WHO, UK and German models were less than 1% of the ADI and ARfD. Intakes are less than 1 % of the ADI and ARfD for WHO and German diets. However the risk assessment can not be finalised because of the rotational crops issue. In soil under aerobic conditions dimethachlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 502662 (accounting for up to 35% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence and CGA 354742(3) accounting for up to 15.8%AR which exhibits moderate persistence. The metabolites CGA 102935(4) (up to 9%AR), data gap identified for soil rate of degradation information and SYN 528702(5) (up to 6.3%AR) were present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 10-40% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 33-57 % AR after 120 days. Dimethachlor exhibits very high to high mobility in soil, CGA 50266 and CGA 354742 exhibit very high mobility in soil. A data gap was identified for information on the mobility of CGA 102935 in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either dimethachlor or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent. In a relevant lysimeter study the metabolites CGA 50266, CGA 354742, SYN 528702, CGA 369873(6), CGA 373464(7) and SYN 530561(8) were identified as being present in lysimeter leachate at annual average concentrations in the range 2.2 to 35.6 mu g/L. In dark natural sediment water systems dimethachlor degraded exhibiting low to moderate persistence in both water and sediment to the metabolite CGA 50266 which was present predominantly in the water (up to 13%AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for up to 2.2% AR (phenyl ring) at 112 days and 3.5% at 182 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink representing up to 53 % AR at 112 days and up to 57% at the study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for dimethachlor at steps 1-4, with just spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites CGA 50266 and CGA 345702 appropriate FOCUS step 3 calculations were carried out (that address the movement of residues from soil to surface water). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by dimethachlor above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent (6) FOCUS groundwater scenarios. There is the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by the identified metabolites. The levels estimated for FOCUS scenarios resulting from the applied for intended use of the metabolites were: CGA 50266 (10.49-21.4 mu g/L), CGA 354742(4.1-13.4 mu g/L), SYN 528702 (1.52-9.21 mu g/L), CGA 369873 (0.24-1.45 mu g/L), CGA 373464 (0.39-2.35 mu g/L) and SYN 530561 (0.22-1.32-mu g/L). A data gap was identified for a groundwater exposure assessment for CGA 102935. The available toxicological data do not allow it to be concluded that these metabolites are not relevant. In groundwater monitoring covering a limited geoclimatic area (northern and north eastern Germany), well water concentrations of up to 0.52 mu g/L for CGA 354742 and 2.1 mu g/L for CGA 369873 were found. Concentrations of the other metabolites were <0.05 mu g/L with the notable exception that no analysis was carried out for CGA 102935. These monitored levels from northern and north eastern Germany cannot be considered representative of groundwater levels that might be present in all territories of the EU as a result of the pattern of use assessed in this conclusion. Five non-standard scenarios including medium herbivorous birds, insectivorous and granivorous birds were considered relevant for the bird risk assessment by RMS. TER values were above the Annex VI trigger for short-term risk for all five scenarios. The acute and long-term risk to birds, which was found to be high in the DAR, was revised following peer-review comments. Herbivorous birds was not considered relevant in the revised risk assessment, as dimethachlor is applied prior to crop emergence in to a clean seed-bed. Skylark (Alauda arvensis) was used as focal insectivorous species. A refined risk assessment based on a mixed diet of large and small insects gave TER values above the Annex VI trigger. The meeting of experts considered that the risk assessment to insectivorous birds may not fully cover risks for herbivorous birds as dimethachlor could be transferred from soil to the plant systemically. Exposure from germinating plants could therefore not be excluded. It was agreed in the meeting to base the refined risk assessment on skylark consuming a mixed diet of grass weed, weed seed and large insects. Calculated TER values were above the trigger and the experts concluded a low acute and long-term risk to omnivorous birds from the use in oilseed rape. The initial risk to mammals was calculated for the two scenarios leafy crop (non-grass herbs) and short grass (grass and cereal shoots) with the hare (Lepus europaeus) as focal species in the DAR. The TER values were above the Annex VI trigger for the acute risk assessment but below the trigger for the chronic risk assessment. PD and PT refinements of the long-term risk assessment were not accepted during the peer-review. As for birds exposure of herbivorous mammals was considered not relevant (see above) and the long-term risk assessment was based on a 10g shrew as a representative insectivorous mammal, feeding on ground-dwelling insects. A TER value of 4.1 indicated a need for further refinements. The meeting of experts agreed to the latter risk assessment. In addition the experts agreed to include a refined long-term risk assessment for an omnivorous mammal, to address also the risk from exposure from emerging plants and off-field plant. Based on a mixed diet TER values in the range of 2.2 to 4.4 were derived and agreed by the meeting expert. Experts concluded that further refinements of the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous and omnivorous mammals were required. A low risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was identified by EFSA after the expert meeting. The risk from metabolites was considered to be low. Dimethachlor was very toxic to aquatic organisms. A potential high risk was indicated with FOCUS step 3 PECsw values based on formulation studies for algae and Lemna. At FOCUS Step 4 including non-spray buffer zones, (1) TER values were calculated based on formulation toxicity (algae and Lemna) divided by PECsw including only spray drift input, and (2) TER values based on the technical substance toxicity (algae and Lemna) divided by PECsw including spray drift, run-off and drainage inputs. Only one safe scenario was identified (R1) with a non-spray buffer zone of 20 m, based on the formulation toxicity to algae. In case of Annex I inclusion of dimethachlor MS should be given the opportunity to ask for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment pertinent to national conditions, given the fact that Annex VI trigger was only met in one out of six scenarios based on the lower toxicity to algae. The risk to aquatic organisms from dimethachlor metabolites was estimated to be low. Dimethachlor was not considered to bio-accumulate (logP(ow) below 3). The risk to bees was considered to be low. Tier 1 off-field risk assessment to non-target arthropods indicated a low risk as did the in-field risk based on extended laboratory studies. Additionally, the risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro and macro organisms was expected to be low. A non-spray buffer zone of 10 m was required for non-target plants to identify a low risk.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cymoxanil,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.167r,"Cymoxanil is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Austria being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cymoxanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 1 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants DuPont de Nemours SAS and Oxon Italia SpA. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on lettuce and potato. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""CYM 50"" and ""Tanos"", a WP and WG formulation containing 500 g a.s. /kg and 250 g a.s. /kg respectively. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). Single methods for the determination of residues in soil, water and air are available. However, a new data gap has been identified as the metabolite IN-KQ9602 has been included in the residue definition for surface water and ground water. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some issues with the technical specifications as well as some physical properties of one of the formulations. Tested in mammals, cymoxanil is harmful if swallowed (Xn R22 was proposed); it shows low toxicity after inhalation and dermal exposure. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. It showed positive results in a Magnusson Kligmann test (Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). Target organs in subchronic exposure were testes (organ weight, macroscopic and microscopic changes), epididymes (macroscopic and microscopic changes), kidney (organ weight) and thymus (histology). The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day (1-year dog study). R48/22 (""Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"") was proposed based on testicular effects in rats and dogs. Overall, cymoxanil does not have genotoxic potential nor carcinogenic potential up to and including the highest dose levels tested. In multigeneration studies, the NOAEL for both parental and offspring effects is 10.5 mg/kg bw/day; the reproductive NOAEL is 31.6 mg/kg bw/day. Fertility was not affected in multigeneration studies, however, based on findings in testes in rats and dogs, possible classification as R62 ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"" should be flagged to EChA. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, cymoxanil showed an NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity in rats of 10 mg/kg bw/day. Increased incidences of treatment related variations (partially ossified and unossified sternebra, wavy ribs and partially ossified pelvis) were observed in rats at maternal toxic dose levels. Incidences for hemi vertebra, exencephaly and fused ribs were shown to be above the range of historical controls at dose levels of clear maternal toxicity. In the rabbit increased incidences of skeletal malformations (vertebra and/or rib alterations linked with scoliosis) were observed at maternally toxic doses, as well as hydrocephaly and cleft palates in the highest dose tested. The incidence of dilation of heart ventricles was statistically significant increased in the high dose animals and was above historical control data, too. An overall maternal and developmental NOAEL of 8 mg/kg bw/day was set. The classification with R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"") should be reconsidered by EChA. The ADI is 0.013 mg/kg bw/day, based on the NOAEL of 1.3 mg/kg bw/day of the 1 year dog study, applying an SF of 100; the ARfD is 0.08 mg/kg bw based on the developmental NOAEL in the rabbit and an SF 100. An AOEL of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was proposed based on the NOAEL in the dog studies of 1.3 mg/kg bw/day corrected for 75% oral absorption and an SF 100. Operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL. Metabolism in plant has been investigated using foliar application of C-14-cymoxanil on two crops, lettuce and potato, representing two groups of plants: leafy and root crop groups. These studies indicated a rapid and extensive degradation of the parent compound over intermediates (IN-W35953, IN-KQ960 or IN-KP533(4)) to glycine which was further conjugated or incorporated in natural substances (carbohydrates, peptides or proteins). Based on these studies, the plant residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was limited to the parent compound cymoxanil only. The rotational crop metabolism study performed on lettuce, sugar beet and wheat with two rotational crop intervals (30 and 120 days) showed that no significant residues of cymoxanil are expected in practice in rotational crops. A goat metabolism study was evaluated indicating that cymoxanil is rapidly and extensively metabolised essentially to natural products. The parent compound cymoxanil was proposed as residue definition for ruminant only. An overall animal residue definition was not proposed as no laying hen study was submitted. A residue data set was available for outdoor uses on lettuce in S-EU only and for potato uses in N-EU and S-EU. All residues being below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg at harvest, a MRL of 0.05* mg/kg was proposed for lettuce and potato. The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments showed that the TMDI and NESTI did not exceed 5% of the ADI and 10% of the ARfD respectively. In soil under aerobic conditions cymoxanil exhibits very low to low persistence forming the major soil metabolites IN-U3204(5) (maximum occurrence 24.7% applied radioactivity (AR)) and IN-W3595 (maximum occurrence 10.1% AR) and the minor metabolites IN-KQ960 and IN-JX9156 (major metabolite in photolysis study) regarded as relevant for assessment of leaching potential to groundwater. All these metabolites exhibit very low or low persistence in soil. The degradation of parent cymoxanil was observed as soil pH dependent (less rapid degradation at lower pH). The transformation pathway of ethyl urea route of cymoxanil and all the possible intermediates or degradation products of this route are unknown, therefore the assessment of this route can not be finalised. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide was significant, as it accounted for 28.6-53.0% AR after 115 days (study end values from 4 soils), and 56.7% or 60.4% AR after 90 or 92 days, respectively. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 22-47% AR after 1-92 days. Cymoxanil exhibits high to very high mobility in soil, the relevant soil metabolites exhibit very high mobility. There was indication that adsorption of metabolites IN-W3595 and IN-R32737 were pH dependent. Under sterile conditions cymoxanil was stable at pH 4, but undergone extensive and fast hydrolysis at pH 5, 7 and 9 forming the major metabolites IN-U3204, IN-JX915, IN-W3595, IN-KP533, IN-R3273 and IN-KQ960. Under irradiated conditions in aqueous photolysis experiments at pH 5 cymoxanil exhibited photo-degradation (net photolysis half-life was calculated to be 1.7 and 3.0 days) forming IN-JX915 and IN-R3273 as major metabolites. In dark natural sediment water systems cymoxanil did not partition to sediment significantly. Fast degradation from the whole system was observed resulting in the range of single first order DT50 values of 0.1 - 1.6 days. The major metabolites formed in the water-sediment systems were IN-U3204, IN-W3595, IN-KQ960, IN-T42268, metabolite fraction M5(9) and IN-KP533. Metabolite IN-KQ960 exhibited medium degradation in natural sediment water systems in the dark, while the other metabolites degraded quickly (SFO DT50 0.4-6.3 days). Mineralisation was significant, CO2 accounted for 39.6 - 75.5 % at the end of the experiments. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 22.5-35.2 % of AR (after 15-30 days) and decreased by the end of the experiments. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach up to step 2. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Based on the vapour pressure and the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation, air is not likely to be a route of environmental contamination by cymoxanil The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses of cymoxanil, IN-U3204, IN-W3595 and IN-JX915 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the metabolite IN-KQ960, in geoclimatic regions represented by Jokioinen and Hamburg FOCUS groundwater scenarios, contaminations of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit cannot be excluded. A non relevance assessment is not available for this metabolite. The acute toxicity to birds was considered to be low. The first tier acute and short-term risk assessment for insectivorous and herbivorous birds indicated a low risk for all intended uses. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to birds. Based on refined residue data the risk to herbivorous birds was considered low for all intended uses. Based on Yellow wagtail and Yellowhammer as focal species and refinement of PD and PT, a low risk was identified for insectivorous birds for all intended uses. Whereas in the first tier the acute risk to insectivorous and herbivorous mammals was considered to be low for all intended uses, only the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals was considered to be low. Further refinements were required for the longterm risk assessment to herbivorous mammals. TER values were above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk to herbivorous mammals for all uses based on available residue data. Additionally, potato foliage was considered unpalatable to herbivorous mammals, hence it was considered a non-relevant scenario. Secondary poisoning was not expected (logPow<3) and risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was considered to be low. Cymoxanil was very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk was considered to be low for the active substance, metabolites and the lead formulations. However, risk assessment for the combined formulation Tanos indicated a need for risk mitigation, e.g. non-spray buffer zones of 30m (to identify a low risk). No bioaccumulation was expected for aquatic organisms (logPow<3). The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metamitron,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.185r,"Metamitron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metamitron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 22 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 24 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide on sugar and fodder beet for the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Goltix SC 700"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 700 g/1 of metamitron. The specification for the technical material as a whole should be regarded as provisional for the moment. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin and for environmental matrices. Mammalian toxicology of metamitron was assessed in a series of investigations. Metamitron is absorbed rapidly and almost completely. It is evenly distributed and has no potential for accumulation. It is rapidly excreted and also quickly and extensively metabolized. Metabolism involves an initial desamination step followed by hydroxylation, oxidation and conjugation reactions. Metamitron is of moderate oral and inhalation, and of very low dermal toxicity. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer. Based on the data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R20 ""Harmful; Harmful by inhalation"" and Xn; R22 ""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed. In short term tests with rodents, liver effects (clinical changes and pathology) were predominant In dogs in addition, also haematological effects were observed. The lowest relevant short-term NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/d was obtained in a 90-day dog study. Metamitron is not genotoxic. Metamitron was not tumorigenic in chronic studies with rats, mice and dogs. The lowest chronic NOAEL of 3.0 mg/kg bw/d was derived from increased cholesterol levels detected in a 2-year dog study. In one of two multigeneration studies conducted, reduced corpora lutea and implantations were observed at doses already toxic to the dams. Neither in rats nor in rabbits were specific developmental effects observed. In single dose pharmacological tests metamitron induced behavioural changes in rats. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.03 mg/kg bw/d based on a NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/d obtained in a 2-year dog study applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.036 mg/kg bw/d based on a NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/d obtained in a 90-day dog study. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was set at 0.1 mg/kg bw based on a maternal NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/d obtained in a rat developmental study that was supported by NOAELs obtained in single dose pharmacologic and functional studies in rats. Only when gloves were used when handling the concentrate and when gloves, coverall and sturdy footwear were worn during application of the formulation, operator exposure resulted in a value below the AOEL in the German model (34%). In the UK POEM the AOEL was exceeded in all scenarios. Exposure of an unprotected worker amounted to 73% of the systemic AOEL. Maximum exposure of bystanders accounted for 23% of the AOEL. The metabolism of metamitron was investigated in sugar beet. Sucrose was the only identified radioactive compound in roots. The experts meeting decided that metabolites found in forage and leaves should not be included in a provisional residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for root/tuber crops, as their levels were considered not to be significant in the diets of livestock. Therefore the proposed residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for root/tuber crops is metamitron only. The residue definition is pending the submission of a metabolism study on rotational crops, which was requested by the experts meeting on the basis of the stability of metamitron in soil. The expert meeting concluded that four residue trials carried out in Northern Europe with acceptable validation data of the analytical methods indicating residues below the LOQ, and in addition trials performed in Southern Europe with residues also below the LOQ, were sufficient to propose a MRL. However, a data gap was formulated for validation data for the method of analysis used in four further residue trials to confirm the validity and completeness of the residue trial data set. Metamitron residues have been shown to be stable under freezing conditions. As residues found in beet roots and leaves at maturity are below the LOQ, processing studies and metabolism studies in livestock are not required. However, the experts meeting proposed a re-entry period after application of metamitron and EFSA notes that tops should not be fed after thinning or crop failure. These suggestions could be reconsidered after submission of validation data for the method of analysis used in further residue trials. On the basis of the calculations carried out by the RMS, chronic and acute intake of residues of metamitron after application according to the notified cGAP are not expected to exceed the ADI and ARfD respectively. In soil under aerobic conditions metamitron exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolite desamino-metamitron2 (accounting for up to 17.1% of applied radioactivity (AR)), which exhibits moderate persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide of the applied [C-14-phenyl]- labelled metamitron accounted for 23.3-57.4% AR after 100-120 days. The formations of unextractable residues were a sink, accounting for 29.5-41.2% AR after 100-120 days. Metamitron exhibits medium to very high mobility in soil. Desamino-metamitron exhibits medium to high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either metamitron or desaminometamitron was pH dependent. There was an unidentified soil metabolite (M3) present in soil that triggers a groundwater exposure assessment. However such an assessment is not available. Hydrolysis was considered to play a minor role, but photodegradation may be a significant route of degradation of metamitron in aquatic systems particularly close to the surface of natural water bodies where indirect photolysis may be significant due to the presence of photosensitizers. In natural sediment water systems metamitron exhibited moderate persistence (total system DT50 10.8-11.4 days) degrading to the major metabolite desamino-metamitron (maximum 54% AR in the water phase and 27.5% in the sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a minimal sink in the material balance accounting for only 1% AR at the study end. Residues not extracted from sediment accounted for 23-26% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for metamitron at steps 1-3 for metamitron and up to step 2 for desamino-metamitron. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios, except for the FOCUS Piacenza scenario where the limit of 0.1 mu g/L was exceeded by metamitron (0.002-0.139 mu g/L) and desamino-metamitron (0.139-1.440 mu g/L). The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs that were above the Annex VI trigger value, except for the acute risk for medium herbivorous birds. The first-tier longterm risk assessment resulted in TERs below the Annex VI trigger value for medium herbivorous and insectivorous birds, respectively, indicating a potential high long-term risk to birds. The refined risk assessment for herbivorous birds was based on reliable foliar residue decline studies and indicated a low risk from acute exposure. The long-term risk for herbivorous and insectivorous birds was further refined by assessing the risk to skylark, yellowhammer and the yellow wagtail (as ""focal species""). The RMS approach included refinements of the dietary consumption (PD) and the proportion of the diet obtained in the treated areas (PT). However, the long-term TERs obtained using the ""focal species"" approach were below the Annex VI triggers for all three focal species indicating that further refinement of the risk to herbivorous and insectivorous species was required. A less conservative approach was suggested by the applicant to assess the risk to herbivorous birds to estimate a 21 day time weighted average (twa) exposure based on a mean daily exposure level for the time period covering the first (day 1), second (day 6) and third (day12) applications, up to 21days after the first application (= 9 days after last treatment) assuming a DT50 of 1.9 days for foliar residues. This approach resulted in a long-term TER for herbivorous birds above the Annex VI trigger value, suggesting a low risk was expected to herbivorous birds. It was also considered that although a low long-term risk to insectivorous birds had not been demonstrated (long term TER for yellow wagtail = 4.1), a further refinement of the exposure estimate (in a similar way to that undertaken for foliar residues) may enable to conclude on a low risk to insectivorous birds. This could be considered at Member State level for product re-registration following Annex I inclusion. The acute and long-term risk to mammals was considered to be low. No risk assessment for secondary poisoning was triggered for metamitron since the log P(ow)A potential high risk to birds and mammals from intake of contaminated water from in-field puddle water was identified. In case of Annex I inclusion, risk mitigation measures or further refinements of the risk assessment should be considered at Member State level. Metamitron is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates, algae and to higher aquatic plants. The TERs based on FOCUS PECsw step 3 were above the Annex VI trigger value for all the representative scenarios, except for the R-3 run-off scenario. From the microcosm study a NOAEC of 1120 mu g a.s./L was proposed by the applicant. The RMS suggests to apply an assessment factor of 3 for the microcosm NOAEC = 1.12 mg a.s./L. The estimated TER values based on the FOCUS Step 3 PECsw were above the Annex VI trigger values for all the representative scenarios. Based on this it could be concluded that the acute and chronic risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to metamitron and the metabolite desamino-metamitron was low. The lowest ER50 values for the non-target plants were observed for rape (ER50 = 54.9 g a.s./ha, pre emergence exposure) and for lettuce (ER50 = 171.6 g a.s./ha, post-emergence exposure). The refined TER values for pre and post-emergence were respectively 0.99 and 4.4 from spray drift at 1 m and 4.9 and 21.5 from spray drift at 5 m. A potential high risk was identified from metamitron exposure to the off-crop non-target plants, therefore risk mitigation measures, similar to a 5 m non-spray buffer zone, were required to identify a low risk. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro and micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA

Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 10 December 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Stabler International GmBH&CoKG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June-July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August-September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator/fungicide for grafting in grapevines, indoor use only. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Rebwachs WF"", a wax formulation containing 0.035 g/kg 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester and 1g/kg 8-hydroxyquinoline; it has no CropLife International code. No residue methods are supplied or required for this active substance because the use will not lead to residues in plants, animals or the environment. Sufficient analytical data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The method of analysis for the active substance in the formulation has been identified as a data gap. There are also data gaps for Henry's law constant, octanol/water partition co-efficient and for water solubility. The technical specification cannot be finalised as new batch data are required. Further information on the starting materials has also been identified as a data gap. In the mammalian metabolism studies 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester was rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, it suffered extensive metabolism to the free acid and the glycine conjugate3 and was rapidly excreted almost exclusively via urine. Acute oral toxicity was moderate in rat and classification with Xn, R22 (""harmful if swallowed"") was proposed. No classification was proposed for dermal or inhalation toxicity, although no study could be concluded by inhalation due to the physico-chemical properties of the active substance; it was not a skin irritant and no potential for skin sensitisation was found, however, classification with Xi, R36 (""irritating to eyes"") was proposed. Only one 28-day oral study in rat gave indication of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for the substance (100 mg/kg bw/day). The waiving of further short term-, long term- and reproductive studies was considered acceptable on the basis of the low amount of the active substance present in the product (0.0035 %), the low production volume (10-20 kg/year) and the lack of consumer exposure through residues. No potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) or Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) were allocated due to the lack of data, but are not required for the single use notified. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.1 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 28-day study in rat and applying a safety factor of 1000. As no study was provided, a default dermal absorption value of 100 % was assumed for the risk assessment. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation ""Rebwachs WF"" was below the AOEL according to the TGD4. Considering the very specific use of 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester, worker and bystander exposure were not considered relevant. The active substance 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester is used as grafting wax for improved callus formation. This is very early in the life-cycle of a vine and it is circa four years before a harvestable crop is produced. Over this period of time the residue will be completely broken down and therefore there will be no significant residues in grapes. No reliable studies on the fate and behaviour in the environment or calculations of predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) in soil, surface water, ground water or air of 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester were available. Due to the representative use of the active substance and the handling of the treated grafts thereafter, the contamination of the environment with 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester or its possible metabolites is regarded as negligible. A data gap was identified for a ready biodegrability test, but only for classification and labelling purposes. A risk assessment to non-target species was not conducted. Due to the representative use of 2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid methylester, the exposure of non-target species was considered to be negligible. As for the classification and labelling of the active substance, a data gap was identified to provide acute aquatic toxicity studies.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dodemorph (considered variant dodemorph acetate),2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.170r,"Dodemorph is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on dodemorph in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 9 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 May 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on roses under permanent protection. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mehltaumittel"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). In the formulation the active substance is present as the acetate variant. Methods of analysis for products of plant and animal origin are not required for the representative use on roses. Adequate methods are available to monitor the sum of cis and trans dodemorph in soil and air. Methods of analysis for water have been identified as a data gap. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some of the quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Several data gaps have been identified. Namely new 5 batch data, water solubility, vapour pressure, Henry's law constant and surface tension. Mammalian toxicology was assessed in a series of tests. Dodemorph is absorbed rapidly to an extent of at least 40%. It is distributed widely and uniformly. It has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted rapidly and practically completely and is extensively metabolised. It is of low acute toxicity by the oral and dermal route. Based on its irritant, corrosive and sensitising properties a classification as Xi; R37 ""Irritant to the respiratory system"", C; R34 ""Corrosive; Causes burns"" (Xi; R41 ""Irritant; Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is implicit) and Xi; R43 ""Irritant; May cause skin sensitisation"" was proposed. Short term studies were carried out with rats, dogs and rabbits. The liver was the main target of toxicity. The lowest NOAEL of 8.2 mg/kg bw/d was based on vomiting, salivation, changes in faecal excretion and liver effects seen in dogs. Dodemorph is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat and an 18-month mouse study have been reported. Critical effects observed were decreased bodyweight gain (both species) and liver effects (rat) while no increased tumour incidences could be observed in these investigations. Dodemorph did not cause effects on reproduction but induced developmental effects in rabbits (open eye, irregularly shapen sternebrae) based on which a classification as Xn; Repr. Cat. 3 R63 ""Harmful; Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was set at 0.082 mg/kg bw/d, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) and the acute reference dose (ARfD) were set at 0.033 mg/kg bw/d and at 0.33 mg/kg bw respectively. Operator exposure amounts to 88% of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) in the form of gloves, coverall and gas mask is worn. Worker exposure when PPE (gloves, coverall and gas mask) is used amounts to 45% of the systemic AOEL of 0.033 mg/kg bw/d. Bystander exposure is not anticipated based on the use of dodemorph in greenhouses. No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of dodemorph in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of dodemorph on roses is normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to humans or livestock animals. A situation where treated rose petals are used for human consumption was neither assessed nor considered. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to dodemorph residues, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative use. In soil under aerobic conditions dodemorph acetate exhibits moderate to high persistence forming no major metabolite (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)), but forming an unknown minor non-transient metabolite. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 17.1-35.9% AR after 93-125 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink accounting for 21.9% to 43.4% of the applied radioactivity after 93-125 days. Dodemorph is immobile in soil and there was no indication that adsorption was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment water systems dodemorph degraded exhibiting fast disappearance from the water column, but high persistence in sediment. No major metabolites were found. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, accounted for 15.4-23.2% AR by 103 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 27-28% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were carried out assuming 0.1% emission from glasshouse (Dutch approach). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by dodemorph above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However no calculation for the unknown minor non-transient metabolite was available. Although it is expected that dodemorph does not reach the surrounding environment in significant amounts, emission to surface water is considered possible. A risk assessment for birds and mammals was provided for exposure from contaminated drinking water and for consumption of contaminated fish. A PECsw value was based on the Dutch model. A long-term reproductive endpoint for birds was estimated by using the lower endpoint from reproductive effect studies on birds for related substances (Structure Activity Relationship). The risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds and mammals exposed to dodemorph through drinking water and fish. In the aquatic environment dodemorph was most toxic to fish and daphnia. It was considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms on an acute scale and very toxic on a chronic scale. Dodemorph is lipophilic (logPow = 4.6) and the bioaccumulation factor was estimated in the range of 583-746 based on whole fish. Given a TER >> 10 based on the fish early life stage endpoint the risk from bioaccumulation was considered to be low. Whereas the risk to bees was considered to be low, assessment of non-target arthropods (NTA) indicated a risk. This is of particular importance as various non-target arthropods may be used in integrated pest management in greenhouses. The risk to earthworms was considered to be low as was the risk to non target soil micro-organisms and micro-organisms in sewage treatment plant. No data were submitted nor required for non-target macro soil organisms. Risk to non-target plants was considered to be negligible for glass house use and no data were submitted by the applicant.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triadimenol,2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.177r,"Triadimenol is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triadimenol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 29 May 2006. The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer Crop Science AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached list of endpoints. Since clarification is required with respect to certain impurities, the specification for the technical material as a whole should be regarded as provisional for the moment. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Bayfidan EC 250"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L triadimenol and ""Baytan FS 094"" a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 75 g/L triadimenol, 9 g/L fuberidazole and 10 g/L imazalil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor triadimenol residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, water and air. In mammals, triadimenol is harmful to rats via the oral route (R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" proposed); it is not acutely toxic via the dermal and inhalation routes, nor is a skin or eye irritant; it is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose studies liver is the target, with enlargement of the liver and related clinical chemistry changes. The relevant short term toxicity NOAELs are 9 and 15 mg/kg bw/day, in rats and dogs, respectively, whereas the relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day. Triadimenol does not have genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. The relevant parental and reproductive NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 6 mg/kg bw/day, and the relevant offspring NOAEL 9 mg/kg bw/day. Reduced pup survival in the multigeneration study during lactation period was noted. Furthermore, a decrease in fertility index was noted in all matings (all generations) in one study, possibly linked to the aromatase inhibition seen in an in vitro study. Therefore R64 ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"" and R62 ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"" were considered as appropriate (to be confirmed by EChA). As for developmental toxicity, in several rat developmental toxicity studies inconsistent effects which could be considered adverse were found (e.g. cervical and lumbar extra ribs). Placental weight was increased in the rats indicating that the substance might be an endocrine disruptor. A range of skeletal findings was seen at slight maternal toxic dose levels. R63? ""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed for consideration by EChA. Relevant maternal NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day and 25 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbit, respectively, and relevant developmental toxicity NOAEL is 15 mg/kg bw/day and 40 mg/kg bw/day (rat and rabbit). Based on similar neurotoxic potential of triadimenol and triadimefon2, data from the latter were used, showing a NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw for acute exposure (reversible hyperactivity and increased motor and locomotor activity in rats, no neuropathological changes), and a subchronic NOAEL of 3.4 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.05 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw (based on an overall NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100). The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure to the EC and the FS formulations is below the AOEL even without the use of PPE. The metabolism of triadimenol in plant was investigated following foliar applications on grapes, cereals and sugar beet and seed treatment on cereals. After foliar or seed treatments triadimenol was found to be the major compound in grapes, cereal grains and straw and sugar beet leaves and roots, accounting for 23 to 73% of the TRR. Hexose conjugate of the parent and the hydroxy metabolite M103 as free or conjugated were also detected in levels above 10%. Together these metabolites are present in amounts similar to or lower than the parent. Triazole Derivative Metabolites (TDMs) were also detected in cereal grains and straw following seed treatment and in cereals sown as rotational crops. Considering the significant proportion of the parent compound in the different plant parts investigated, the residue definition for monitoring was limited to triadimenol. For risk assessment, it was proposed to include in the residue definition the parent triadimenol, the metabolite M10 and their conjugates. Taking into account the proportions of the parent and of the metabolites, a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the risk assessment for cereals only. Concerning the TDMs, the meeting of experts was of the opinion not to include these metabolites in the triadimenol residue definitions since TDMs are not specific to triadimenol and there is currently no EU approach on how to consider these common triazole metabolites in the risk assessment. A separate residue definition has to be set and a separate risk assessment has to be performed for TDMs taking into account all the active substances of the triazole chemical class. This issue should be reconsidered when a general approach on triazole compounds and their triazole derivative metabolites is defined. Supervised residue trials on grapes and cereals have been submitted. Residues were analysed for triadimenol only and no information was provided on the possible residue levels of the hydroxy metabolite M10 or the TDMs. Sufficient data were provided to propose a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) on wine and table grapes. On cereals, a provisional MRL was proposed for barley and oat only, awaiting additional residue data on barley in southern EU and in northern and southern EU for wheat. Triadimenol was stable under standard hydrolytic conditions and processing studies on grape showed a limited transfer of residues to wine. The submitted rotational crop studies, not performed in compliance with the requested standards, indicated that residues of the parent compound and its triazole derivative metabolites may be expected to be above the limit of quantification (LOQ). The experts' meeting was of the opinion that a new field study on rotational crops conforming to the current guidelines is required, where crops should be analysed for triadimenol and TDMs residues. Moreover, the residue situation in rotational crops should be reconsidered with regard to a global approach on TDMs. Metabolism studies in goats and hens were carried out with the active substance triadimefon. Nevertheless and given that the major metabolic pathway of triadimefon in animals consists as a first step in producing triadimenol, these studies were considered as fully acceptable for the understanding of the triadimenol metabolism in animals The metabolism of triadimenol in livestock is extensive and proceeds mainly via oxidation of the tertiary butyl group to the hydroxy metabolite M10 and the carboxy metabolite M024, both being subjected to conjugation with sulphate or glucuronic acid respectively. In hens, an additional pathway consisting of desmethylation was identified. The meeting of experts concluded that triadimenol could not be a valid marker for animal products since it was observed in significant levels in ruminant liver and in poultry fat and eggs only. Therefore, the animal residue definition for risk assessment was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and M02 and their conjugates and metabolite M28(5). For monitoring the residue definition was proposed as triadimenol plus metabolite M10 and their conjugates and metabolite M28. Considering the limited transfer observed in the animal feeding studies and the low potential exposure to triadimenol residues through the consumption of treated food items (cereals), the meeting was of the opinion that there is no need to set MRLs for products of animal origin at this stage. As for plants, the possible inclusion of the TDMs in the animal residue definition has been discussed. It was concluded that no significant TDMs residues resulting from the direct intake of triadimefon/triadimenol are expected in products of animal origin. Nevertheless the animal dietary burden should also take into account the additional exposure arising from TDMs residues present in feeding commodities from both, primary and rotational crops (especially in cereal straw and cereal grains). As for plants, this issue will need to be reconsidered at a later stage when a global EU approach on TDMs is defined. The consumer risk assessment has been performed through the residues of triadimenol only and according to the residue definition proposed for plants. The contribution of the TDMs residues in primary crops, rotational crops and products of animal origin resulting from the use of triadimenol has not been evaluated and not been taken into account in the consumer risk assessment awaiting the definition of a global EU approach concerning these metabolites which are common to all active substances of the triazole chemical class. Taking into account the above considerations, the chronic and acute consumer exposures performed using the EFSA model and the proposed MRLs for cereals and grape were found to be less than 3% of the ADI and 27% of the ARfD. In soil under aerobic conditions triadimenol exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the soil metabolite M046 (accounting for up to 8.2% of applied radioactivity (AR) in a lysimeter study) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of the triazole ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 3.8-41% AR after 100 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4.5-22.3 % AR after 100 days. Triadimenol exhibits low to very high mobility in soil, M04 exhibits high to very high mobility in soil. It was concluded that it was unlikely that adsorption of triadimenol was pH dependent. The adsorption of M04 was not pH dependent. In dark laboratory natural sediment water systems triadimenol exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 3.7 % AR after 13 weeks. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were performed for triadimenol (up to FOCUS step 3 calculations) and for M04 (with appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations). These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by triadimenol and 1,2,4triazole above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios relevant to the intended uses applied for. The atmospheric half life estimated for triadimenol (2.5 hours) gives an indication that it has not the potential to be subject to long range transport to areas where it has not been used, via the atmosphere. Whereas the acute and short-term risk to birds from spray use in cereals indicated a low risk at Tier 1, the long-term assessment required further refinements. Use of field residue data, PD refinements and focal species in a refined assessment, indicated a low risk for large herbivorous birds. Further refinements were however required to identify a low risk to skylark feeding on insects. For vine use (spray application) the risk assessment indicated a low risk to birds, except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds in South Europe. Refinements of PT with Chaffinch, Blue tit and Robin as focal species were derived from UK orchard studies. It was concluded in the meeting of experts that further data were required to support the use of UK orchard data to refine the long-term risk assessment for insectivorous birds in South Europe. For seed treatment use a low acute risk was identified for birds. The short-term risk assessment required further refinements. The meeting of experts did not accept the PT refinements suggested for yellowhammer, wood pigeon and skylark as focal species, and further data to substantiate the refinements were required. The long-term risk to birds was considered to be negligible, due to lack of exposure in the breeding season. EFSA however, noted that the breeding season for birds may extend into the season for use of triadimenol as a seed treatment in South Europe. The acute risk assessment for small herbivorous and insectivorous mammals indicated a low risk for spray use in cereals. Low risk was also identified for small herbivorous mammals in the long-term assessment, after refinement of residue data. For spray use in vine the acute risk was considered as low for both North Europe and South Europe. The long-term risk assessment for both North Europe and South Europe required further refinements of interception, dissipation rate and TWA concentration in ground vegetation before a low risk was identified. For seed treatment uses, the acute risk to mammals was concluded to be low after refinement of PD. The long-term risk assessment, however, needed to be refined further. No exposure to contaminated drinking water was expected and the risk from secondary poisoning was considered to be low. The potential endocrine disrupting effects on birds may require further assessment. Triadimenol should be classified as R51/53 ""Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment."" and the risk assessment for aquatic organisms indicated a low risk for all uses, based on FOCUS PECsw estimations up to Step 3. The risk to aquatic organisms from triadimenol metabolites was found to be low, as was the potential for bioaccumulation of triadimenol and its metabolites. The potential for endocrine effects on fish was not assessed in the DAR, as no relevant studies were available. A fish early life study (ELS) and a fish screening assay (FSA) were carried out by the applicant during the peer-review process to address potential endocrine effects. However they were not eligible for submission in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. The risk assessment for bees indicated a low risk for all uses. As triadimenol is systemic, the risk assessment for seed treatment use was based on the assumption that the concentration in the honey dew would correspond to the concentration in the plant. The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro and macro organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. No studies using the formulated products Baytan FS 094 for seed treatment were available. In consequence the risk to non-target organisms from the use of Baytan FS 094 could not be concluded since this product, besides triadimenol, also contains fuberidazole and imazalil.",NA
[Anonymous],"Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Copper (I), copper (II) variants namely copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, copper (I) oxide, Bordeaux mixture",2008,EFSA JOURNAL,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.187r,"Copper (I), copper (II) variants (formerly referred to as copper compounds) are one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on copper (I), copper (II) variants in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant the European Union Copper Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide/bactericide on grapes and tomatoes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Kocide 101"" (copper hydroxide), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; ""Mace 80"" (Bordeaux mixture), a wettable powder formulation containing 200 g/kg of Cu; ""Cuprocaffaro WP"" (copper oxychloride), a wettable powder formulation containing 500 g/kg of Cu; ""Cuproxat SC"" (tribasic copper sulfate), a suspension concentrate formulation containing 193 g/L of Cu and ""Nordox 75 WG "" (copper (I) oxide), a wettable granule formulation containing 750 g/kg Cu. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The methods of analysis for the technical materials and the formulations are not accepted at this time as the identity of the various variants of copper are in question. The specifications and batch data are not accepted. In addition to this, there are some missing physical and chemical properties as well as storage stability data for the variants of copper. In the mammalian metabolism studies, bioequivalence was established for the five representative copper (I) and (II) variants with copper sulphate pentahydrate, with which most of the toxicological studies were conducted. As a micronutrient essential for life, copper follows a specific homeostatic regulation mechanism, which allows excess copper to be excreted mainly through the bile; once absorbed, copper is bound to proteins so that free copper is normally not found neither in the blood, nor in the cells. Copper hydroxide is toxic by inhalation, harmful if swallowed and present a risk of serious damage to eyes. Bordeaux mixture is harmful by inhalation and presents a risk of serious damage to eyes. Copper oxychloride and copper (I) oxide are harmful by inhalation and if swallowed. Tribasic copper sulphate is harmful if swallowed. Target organs of excess copper after oral administration are the liver and the kidneys. A concern was raised over inhalation of copper as lung lesions found in operator exposure were reproducible in guinea pigs; a data gap was identified for a short term inhalation toxicity study. Genotoxicity was not of concern upon oral administration, however, there was insufficient evidence to exclude a genotoxic potential of copper after non-oral exposure, and a critical area of concern was raised after inhalation of copper (I) and (II) variants. No carcinogenic potential was attributed to copper, neither in rats nor in humans. Copper did not produce adverse effect on fertility, reproductive parameters or on the development; no neurotoxicity was attributed to copper ingestion, either. Four categories of copper poisoning were identified in the literature, namely direct oral ingestion as suicide attempts, cases where food or drinking water had become contaminated with copper, cases where home-made Bordeaux mixture had resulted in lung disease, and a single case of long term administration of excess copper as a dietary supplement resulting in liver failure. Based on the WHO values established for human copper intake, the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) or more appropriately designated as ""upper limit for copper intake"" - for copper (I) and (II) variants was 0.15 mg Cu/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.072 mg Cu/kg bw/day and no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Default value of 10 % for dermal absorption was set for the five concentrate representative formulations and the in-use spray dilutions. Operator exposure calculated for field applications was below the AOEL only, if personal protective equipment (PPE) was used; for greenhouse applications, estimated operator exposure was below the AOEL only, if a respiratory protective equipment (RPE) was added to the PPE. Unprotected bystander exposure was calculated to be below the AOEL for all proposed uses and all representative formulations. Estimates of worker exposure indicated that exposure to copper (I) and (II) variants may exceed the AOEL for workers wearing protective gloves, long sleeved shirt and long trousers in some scenarios of application. Therefore, a refinement of worker risk assessment is required for those specific scenarios. Data presented and evaluated on the uptake, translocation and nature of copper residues in plants consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. To determine the magnitude of residues in the treated raw agricultural commodities, residue trials in grapes and tomatoes were submitted. Also data on the residue levels in processed tomato and grape products were made available, but only found valid and acceptable for grapes. The data allow for MRL proposals and for a consumer exposure assessment with regard to the notified representative uses. As exposure to copper is not only due to residues from the use as a plant protection product, an aggregate exposure assessment was performed by the rapporteur Member State, including in addition background levels of copper in food and drinking water, based on a recent French dietary survey. This aggregate estimate shows that, in particular for children, the overall dietary copper exposure is not negligible and approximates the established toxicological reference value. Additional potential sources of dietary copper intakes have not been considered. Moreover, the estimate is not representative for all European consumers and therefore situations may arise where the overall copper intake of some consumer groups exceeds the toxicological reference value. The data presented in the dossier and summarized in the DAR on the fate and behaviour of copper in soil consist mainly of a review of public scientific literature. Although the information is qualitatively complete, it does not allow deriving quantitative parameters to perform a proper environmental risk assessment. Data gaps have been identified by the rapporteur Member State for accumulated PEC soil, PECSW/SED and PECGW values as well as for the experimental (laboratory, field or monitoring) data to asses them. The data gaps have been confirmed by the peer review. The representative uses of the various copper variants are applications to vines and tomatoes (outdoor and indoor). The risk to herbivorous birds from the use in tomatoes was considered low since the tomato foliage is not palatable to birds. The first-tier acute, short-term and long-term TERs for insectivorous birds were below the Annex VI trigger values for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment suggests a low acute and short-term risk to birds, but further refinement is needed for the long-term risk assessment. The first-tier long-term TERs for earthworm-eating birds and mammals were below the Annex VI trigger of 5. No further information was provided to refine the risk assessment and a data gap was identified in the meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment for mammals indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk. The refined risk assessment submitted by the applicant was not transparent. It was not clear which refinements were taken into account and no information/data were provided to support the refined acute and long-term risk assessment. Therefore, a data gap was identified for a refined risk assessment for mammals where all refinement steps are transparent and supported by information/data. The risk to birds and mammals from the use in tomatoes in glasshouse is considered to be low because of negligible exposure. Copper is very toxic to the aquatic organisms. An indoor-microcosm study was submitted to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates. The experts suggested using a NOEC of 3.12 lag Cu (dissolved)/L together with a safety factor of 3-5 to take into account uncertainties related to effects on chironomids and possible favourable exposure conditions in the microcosm (high pH). Information from public literature suggests a high potential of bioaccumulation of copper in some aquatic organisms. The potential risk of bioaccumulation in fish needs to be addressed further. A data gap was identified in the meeting to address the risk from bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms needs to be finalized once reliable PECsw/sed values are established for the outdoor uses of copper in tomato and vines. The risk to aquatic organisms from the use in tomato in glasshouse is considered to be low. The risk to bees from contact exposure was assessed as low, except for copper oxychloride and the Bordeaux mixture. The risk to bees from oral exposure was assessed as high in the first-tier risk assessment, and the experts suggested a data gap to address the risk to bees further. A high long-term risk to earthworms was indicated on the basis of the available information. A data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to earthworms. Information from published studies with soil macro-organisms was submitted by the applicant. The studies were considered as reliable and robust enough to be considered in the risk assessment. No effects of >25% on soil nitrification were observed up to the highest tested application rate of 20 kg Cu/ha. A reduction of 29 % in carbon mineralization was observed on day 28, at an application rate of 12.5 kg Cu/ha in a study with copper hydroxide. However, a final conclusion on the risk to soil macro- and micro-organisms can only be drawn after reliable PECsoil values have been established. The assessment of the risk to non-target plants is based on information from public literature. It was not possible for the experts to draw a conclusion on the reliability of the studies. The experts agreed that a more comprehensive summary of the literature information is needed. Furthermore, the accumulation of copper in the off-field area should be considered in the risk assessment. The risk to non-target arthropods and to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance teflubenzuron Issued on 29 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.184r,"Teflubenzuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on teflubenzuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 26 November 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF Agro BV. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying in apple and indoor tomatoes for the control of codling moth, leafminers, whiteflies and caterpillars. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Nomolt"", a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 150 g/l teflubenzuron. The minimum purity of teflubenzuron could not be concluded on as with the data available no specification could be set. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are methods available to monitor teflubenzuron residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for confirmatory method(s) for the determination of teflubenzuron from plant matrices, from soil and from drinking and surface water. An analytical method to determine teflubenzuron residues in surface water with an LOQ of 0.0025 mu g/l and a primary method for the determination of teflubenzuron from air with an LOQ of 1.8 mu g/m(3) are missing. In the mammalian metabolism studies, teflubenzuron was rapidly but only partially absorbed after oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; teflubenzuron was eliminated mainly unchanged via faeces. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route and no eye or skin irritation was observed. As the study on skin sensitisation was not considered acceptable by the experts, classification of teflubenzuron with R43, may cause sensitization by skin contact, was proposed. The main target organ of teflubenzuron was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for short term exposure was the dose level of 8.0 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; only a LOAEL could be derived from the long term studies due to slight hepatotoxicity found at 2.1 mg/kg bw/day in the 18-month oncogenicity study in mouse. Benign hepatocellular adenomas observed only in this mouse study were not considered relevant for human exposure. There was no evidence for genotoxic or neurotoxic potential related to teflubenzuron administration; no effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was observed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of teflubenzuron was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL from the 18-month study in mouse and applying a safety factor of 200; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.016 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 20 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 2 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 20 % for the in-use spray dilution. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Nomolt, at a maximum dose rate of 0.120 kg teflubenzuron/ha in apples and of 0.225 kg teflubenzuron/ha in protected tomatoes was below the AOEL, when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with teflubenzuron was below the AOEL, either if the dermal absorption assumption is based on the value obtained with the concentrate formulation or, alternatively, if PPE are worn. Bystander, residential and exposure of small children playing on a lawn contaminated with fallout from spray drift containing Nomolt were all estimated to be below the AOEL. Concerning residues, the metabolism of teflubenzuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and a further study on spinach which was not regarded as acceptable by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The major component in the crops at harvest was unmetabolised teflubenzuron. The experts requested new metabolism studies on rotational crops to support the use of teflubenzuron on tomatoes grown in glass houses on soil based systems, because the submitted studies were under dosed. Therefore, only a provisional residue definition could be proposed. Currently only the use of teflubenzuron on protected tomatoes is sufficiently supported by residue trials to set a provisional MRL. The PRAPeR meeting of experts followed the RMS's suggestion and set a data gap for residue trials on cherry tomatoes to cover fully the notified use on tomatoes. For the use on apples a data gap for further residue trials was identified. Sufficient processing studies on tomatoes were submitted to calculate transfer factors. Further processing studies are required for apples. The metabolism study on goats and the animal transfer studies on dairy cattle require further investigation and the PRAPeR meeting of experts proposed a data gap for a new metabolism study and data on storage stability in animal products. Depending on the results of the metabolism study further studies on livestock might be required. Therefore, only provisional residue definitions for animal products were proposed. Intake calculations for livestock, which are required to support the notified use on apples, can only be carried out when the additional data on livestock and apple processing studies are available. The consumer risk assessment and the MRL proposals cannot be finalised. On the basis of a provisional intake calculation for tomatoes only, the consumer exposure is expected to be below the ADI. Teflubenzuron is moderate to high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions (DT50 = 30.4 - 151.5 d) and yields 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea as a major metabolite. Another metabolite, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline, exceeded 5 % in two non consecutive data points. After consultation with the experts on toxicology, a data gap to address ground water exposure for this metabolite has been identified. Reliable kinetic parameters (formation and degradation rate constants) for the major metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-dichlorophenylurea were not available and the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a data gap for these parameters. The ground water exposure assessment may need to be subsequently updated. Degradation was faster under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic ones in the experiment available where the rest of conditions are maintained. However, anaerobic conditions are not considered to be especially relevant for the representative uses (tomato and apple) evaluated at EU level. Photolysis does not significantly contribute to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron in soil under EU realistic conditions. Four field dissipation studies are available, which allow appropriately deriving the dissipation half lives for PEC soil calculations. However, the PRAPeR meeting of experts identified a new data gap for a new kinetic evaluation of field dissipation study for its use in environmental modelling. This data gap was not considered essential to finalise the EU risk assessment. PEC soil of teflubenzuron was calculated in the DAR for the use in apples (outdoor) based on the worst case field half live of 16.4 days. For the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline the peak maximum PEC soil was calculated based on the maximum formations observed in the laboratory studies. According to the available studies teflubenzuron may be considered immobile in soil (K-OC = 21 139 32 556 mL / g) and the metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea may be considered to exhibit low mobility in soil (KOC = 942 - 1720 mL / g). In water teflubenzuron is stable at pH 5 and 7 and hydrolyses with a DT50 = 8.7 d at pH 9. The metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea is expected to be stable to hydrolysis in the normal range of environmental conditions. The RMS estimated an aqueous photolysis half-life of 13.7 days (40 degrees N, continuous irradiation) on basis of the available study. RMS considered that photolysis would not contribute significantly to the environmental degradation of teflubenzuron under realistic conditions for the representative uses. Teflubenzuron was not readily biodegradable according the available study. Dissipation / degradation of teflubenzuron was investigated in two dark aerobic water/sediment systems. In both systems, teflubenzuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50whole system = 11 - 21.4 d) to form the major metabolites 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline (UNK 5 in the DAR), 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenyl-urea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid. The applicant provided PECSW/SED calculations based on FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 for the metabolites 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluorophenylurea, 3,5-dichloro-2,4difluoroaniline, 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid and 5-chloro-2,4-difluoroaniline for the use in apples. For the parent teflubenzuron PECSW/SED values were calculated with FOCUS scheme up to Step 4 considering up to 100 m spray drift buffer zone for the use in apples. It is noted that this buffer zone represents a 99.6 % mitigation when compared with Step 3 (above the 95 % mitigation deemed as practicable by the FOCUS Landscape and Mitigation guidance document). For the greenhouse use in tomatoes the RMS provided indicative parent PECSW value of 0.0225 mg/L based on 0.1 % losses to surface water (Dutch model). However, the RMS also indicated that from the ecotoxicology assessment the total loss from glasshouse should be 0.00001 % only. To attain this low level, glasshouses would have to operate with negligible emissions of teflubenzuron. With the available information, it is not possible to assess if measures that actually achieve these low levels of emission rates are practicable. Therefore, EFSA proposed a critical area of concern for the aquatic environment with respect to the uses in green house. The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered for teflubenzuron that the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L is not expected to be exceeded for the representative use in apples. No PECGW calculations are available for metabolite 3,5-dichloro-2,4-difluoroaniline. The need to address the potential ground water contamination by this metabolite has been identified after consultation with the PRAPeR meeting of experts on toxicology. No groundwater assessment is available for the greenhouse use. Therefore, the assessment presented is considered only to address situations were plants are grown on artificial substrate or on hydroponics. On basis of its properties long term transport of teflubenzuron through the atmosphere is not expected to be of concern. The acute and short term risk to birds and the acute and long term risk to mammals were concluded to be low in a first-tier assessment. No valid long term endpoint (reproductive toxicity) was available for birds and therefore, a data gap was identified for a suitable chronic study. The risk to earthworm and fish-eating mammals was considered low. Teflubenzuron is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. A lower acute toxicity to fish was observed when formulated. Water/sediment metabolites were less toxic than the active substance and thus considered as not ecotoxicologically relevant. The most sensitive organisms tested were aquatic invertebrates. These effects were addressed by higher tier studies. A NOEC = 0.005 mu g a.s./L from a mesocosm study and an assessment factor (AF) of 2 was agreed by the PRAPeR meeting of experts. The first-tier risk assessment indicated a potential high risk to aquatic organisms. For the outdoor use on apples, FOCUS step 4 scenarios only resulted in toxicity exposure ratios (TERs) above the trigger values for fish and algae if a no-spray buffer zone of 16 m was included in the calculations. None of the FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in TERs above the triggers for invertebrates, even including a no-spray buffer of 100 m and taking into account the higher tier study. For the application on greenhouse tomatoes, TERs based on the Dutch model PEC values were below the Annex VI triggers, except those related to the formulated product for fish (acute) and for algae. As mentioned above, a total loss percentage from glasshouses as low as 0.00001% would be needed to be achieve a low risk. Since during the peer review no mitigation measures were assessed which could allow the achievement of such negligible emissions, a potential high risk to aquatic organisms from greenhouse uses cannot be excluded. A data gap was suggested for further refinements. A low risk to adult bees was identified. A potential high risk to hive development was not excluded, as clear effects on the bee population reduction were observed at tested rates lower than the GAP. Therefore, a data gap was suggested to further address the risk to bees for the outdoor use. For the glasshouse use the risk to bee population was expected to be low. However the risk to introduced pollinators might need to be managed. A high risk for non-target-arthropods was identified for the in-field exposure scenario and a no-spray buffer zone of 15 m would be needed to meet the trigger of 2 for the off-field scenario. The oral uptake was considered by the RMS a major route of exposure. The submitted data as well as the ESCORT2 approach did not address this route of exposure. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods (i.e. a field study), considering the mode of action of the active substance and the potential for recovery. Since teflubenzuron is a chitin synthesis inhibitor, a data gap was identified for a chronic study on earthworms, even if the acute risk was assessed as low and the DT50 in soil was lower than 100 d. The risk to other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance magnesium phosphide Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.190r,"Magnesium phosphide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on magnesium phosphide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 29 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Detia Freyberg GmbH. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, rodenticide, talpicide and leporicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Degesch Magtoxin"", a gas generating product (GE). The gas phosphine that is produced is the true active ingredient. A method of analysis for phosphine in products of plant origin is available however ILV and a confirmatory method have been identified as a data gap. A method for products of animal origin is not required as MRLs have not been set. Methods for phosphine in soil are not required as the DT90 in soil is < 3 days for phosphine. A method is available for phosphine in water but a confirmatory method has been identified as a data gap. It should be noted however, that there is a confirmatory method in the aluminium phosphide DAR. The method of analysis for air did not have a low enough LOQ and a data gap was identified. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The meeting of experts considered the specification and impurities on the basis that the spent pellets were contained and removed from the treated material. Therefore, given the toxicity of phosphine, possible relevant impurities were ignored. The case where the spent material is not removed has not been considered in the peer review process. The mammalian toxicology of magnesium phosphide was assessed in a series of tests. When coming into contact with moisture magnesium phosphide decomposes to magnesium hydroxide and phosphine which is the toxicologically active and relevant component for the assessment of mammalian toxicology of magnesium phosphide. Magnesium phosphide is classified as R29 ""Contact with water liberates toxic gas"". In addition a classification as R32 ""Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas"" has been proposed by the experts. Phosphine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. It is widely and evenly distributed in the body and has no potential for accumulation. Phosphine is excreted as such via expired air or with the urine in form of hypophosphite or phosphite. Magnesium phosphide is very toxic by the oral and inhalation route and harmful by the dermal route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer. Based on data on acute toxicity a classification as T+; R28 ""Very toxic if swallowed"", Xn; R21 ""Harmful in contact with skin"" and T+; R26 ""Very toxic by inhalation"" is proposed. A short term NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d for phosphine (the highest dose tested, no adverse effects observed) was derived from a 90-day inhalation rat study. Magnesium phosphide is not genotoxic. A NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d, which was the highest dose tested since no adverse effects were observed, was established for phosphine in a 2-year inhalation study with rats. A mouse carcinogenicity study was not carried out and not considered necessary based on the toxicity profile of the substance (lethality anticipated at low doses). In an inhalation developmental study with rats (a rabbit study was not provided) no specific developmental effects were observed and an overall NOAEL of 1.9 mg/kg bw/d was set based on mortality occurring in dams. Effects on reproduction have not been assessed, but are based on the toxicity profile of the substance not anticipated. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) have been set at 0.022 mg/kg bw/d. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was fixed at 0.038 mg/kg bw. The corresponding values for phosphine are 0.011 mg/kg bw/d (ADI and AOEL) and 0.019 mg/kg bw (ARfD).When applying magnesium phosphide in rodent burrows without the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) maximum exposure levels amounted to a maximum of 93% of the AOEL for operators. For workers and bystanders, however, actual exposure levels will be considerably lower. Application of magnesium phosphide in storage rooms when no respiratory protective equipment is used amounted for operators to 30% and 120% of the AOEL considering low and high use respectively. When respiratory protective is used the value for high use application is reduced to 10% of the AOEL. EFSA disagrees with the operator exposure assessment for the use of magnesium phosphide in storage rooms. Exposures of workers and bystanders after application in storage rooms account for a maximum of 25% and 33% of the systemic AOEL respectively. Two main uses of magnesium phosphide were evaluated, 1) as rodenticide, talpicide, leporicide to control rodent and non-rodent species by fumigation of underground tunnels and burrows in cropland and non-cropland situations, 2) as fumigant to control insects in various harvested plant products and in empty warehouses or transportation facilities. Due to its physico-chemical properties, no specific studies to evaluate metabolism and distribution of magnesium phosphide in treated commodities were submitted. In contact with soil or atmospheric moisture, magnesium phosphide is rapidly hydrolysed to produce phosphine (PH3) and magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2. After treatment the major part of phosphine is volatilised and diluted in air or oxidised to phosphorous oxyacids of no significant concern for human health. Considering stored fumigated commodities may contain residual gaseous phosphine and residual metal phosphide, the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set as ""phosphine and phosphine generators (relevant phosphide salts) determined and expressed as phosphine"". No residue trials were submitted to support the uses of magnesium phosphide as rodenticide, considering that the direct application of the active substance into underground tunnels of rodent or non-rodent animals excludes the direct contact with plants and therefore, the possible residues in plants. For post harvest applications, in addition to the aeration period, the RMS proposed for each commodity or group of commodities a withholding period. Thus, during the meeting, the MRL proposals were not discussed on the basis of the residue levels observed at the end of the aeration period as stated in the GAP, but at the end of these additional withholding periods of 7 to 35 days, depending on the commodities. Consequently and after the meeting, EFSA was of the opinion that the fumigation practices have not been sufficiently defined to allow the MRL setting, and considers the fact that the withholding periods were not clearly described in the intended GAP as a data gap. No storage stability study was provided considering that the inherent properties of phosphine lead to a low stability in stored products. No processing studies and no livestock metabolism and feeding studies were provided, considering that no significant residues of magnesium phosphide and phosphine are expected in post harvested plant commodities. No rotational crop studies were submitted since no residues in soil are expected from the outdoor uses on rodent and non-rodent species. No unacceptable chronic or acute risks to consumers were identified, taking into account that the proposed MRL values do not reflect the critical GAPs as initially defined by the applicants. When placed in animal burrows (i.e. the soil environment) magnesium phosphide will rapidly hydrolyse producing phosphine gas and magnesium salts. The phosphine gas produced which was shown to exhibit very low persistence will volatilise to the atmosphere or adsorb to soil and be converted to phosphate anions. Any phosphine gas that reaches the upper atmosphere will be subject to indirect photooxidation to phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid that would be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition. The rate of indirect photooxidation of phosphine measured was rapid enough to indicate that phosphine will not be subject to long range atmospheric transport. The potential for groundwater exposure of magnesium phosphide and phosphine was assessed as low from the applied for intended uses. There is a potential for surface water exposure by phosphine gas when treated target organism burrows are adjacent to surface water (via movement in the gas phase). A data gap was identified to better characterise this exposure potential. Due to the representative uses (applied outdoor directly into the burrow systems or indoor in food storage rooms), the exposure to non-target species was considered to be only local or negligible. On the basis of potential exposure of surface water to phosphine, in case that target organism burrows are adjacent to water bodies, the risk from the outdoor use to aquatic organisms needs to be addressed and therefore valid studies on invertebrates and algae should be provided. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non target macro- and micro- organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was expected to be low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diphenylamine Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.188r,"Diphenylamine is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) upon request of the EU Commission to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within 6 months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diphenylamine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 8 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants Cerexagri s.a. and Pace International. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a plant growth regulator as proposed by the applicant. It is applied as a post harvest drench to apples before they go into storage. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""No Scald DPA 31"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for surface water. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of diphenylamine. The residue meeting of experts has concluded that it might be necessary to set MRLs for products of animal origin. Therefore a data gap is identified for a method of analysis for products of animal origin. If no MRLs are set then of course this data gap will be obsolete. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are several outstanding issues with the technical specification and some aspects of the storage stability and properties of the plant protection product. In the mammalian metabolism studies, diphenylamine was rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, it suffered extensive metabolism to sulphonyl and glucuronyl conjugates and is rapidly excreted mainly via urine. Acute oral and dermal toxicity were low; no acute inhalation toxicity study was submitted, therefore a data gap was set for this study. Diphenylamine was not a skin irritant, but can cause severe irritation to the eyes; therefore, classification with Xi irritant and risk phrase R41 ""risk of serious damage to eyes"" was proposed. According to a Magnusson and Kligman test, diphenylamine was not a skin sensitizer. The red blood system was the target organ of diphenylamine in rats, mice and dogs, upon short term and long term exposure, as evidenced by altered haematological parameters, splenic erythropoiesis, splenic congestion and haemosiderosis. Additionally, histopathological changes in the liver and kidneys were found upon longer exposure. The relevant short term NOAEL of 9.6-10 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the 90-day rat, 90-day dog and 1-year dog studies. The relevant long term NOAEL was the dose level of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. No genotoxic potential is attributed to diphenylamine; no carcinogenicity was observed in either rats or mice. Reproductive effects were limited to reduced implantation sites in F-1 females associated with reduced litter size at clear parental toxic doses (reduced food intake/ body weight gain and haemolytic condition). No effect on development was attributed to diphenylamine administration in rat or rabbit. No neurotoxic alert was evident in the data package provided. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of diphenylamine was 0.075 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.1 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day rat, 90-day and 1-year dog studies, and applying a safety factor of 100; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. As no study was provided, default dermal absorption value of 100 % was assumed for risk assessment. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation No Scald DPA 31 was below the AOEL according to the mixing and loading phase of the German model only if operators wear gloves. Considering the very specific use of diphenylamine, bystander and worker exposure were not considered relevant. Metabolism of diphenylamine was investigated in apples having received a post-harvest treatment. Total residues declined only slowly over storage time. Upon analysis diphenylamine was always the major residue, however identification of metabolites was considered insufficient by the meeting of experts and therefore further investigation is required. Also the potential for presence or formation of nitrosamine in apple metabolism or during processing should be addressed by further data, as well as the nature of residues in processed apple commodities. Thus, a plant residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring could only provisionally be proposed. Livestock metabolism and feeding studies in ruminants were submitted and evaluated. However, the assessment of the nature and magnitude of residues in livestock could not be finalised since different points remained open for further clarification or revision. The applicant made a case that treated apples are destined only for direct human consumption and will not be part of livestock diet. Therefore taking into account livestock exposure and residues in food of animal origin would not be necessary, if it can definitely be excluded that treated apples may become part of livestock diet. Consideration of the issue by risk managers is required. If however there may be dietary exposure of livestock to treated apple commodities, the process of the assessment of nature and magnitude of residues in livestock has to be resumed and continued, and MRLs for food of animal origin will be necessary. A consumer risk assessment was provisionally performed, assuming the relevant residue was diphenylamine alone and residues were present in apples at the level of the proposed MRL, and in a refined assessment (NEDI) at the level of the median residue found from five available residue trials. While the NEDI was below the ADI for all considered consumer groups, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) exceeded the ADI for children in one member state diet. The only data available in the dossier provided, pertinent to the fate and behaviour of diphenylamine in the environment were the results that it exhibits moderate water solubility, is stable to sterile aqueous hydrolysis, exhibits very low persistence in direct aqueous photolysis experiments in the laboratory (optimised light conditions) and is moderately volatile. Indirect photooxidation in the atmosphere through reaction with hydroxyl radicals was also estimated. However it was concluded that despite these limited data, as a consequence of the applied for intended use of diphenylamine, this information was sufficient to characterise the environmental risk at the EU level as exposure of soil, surface water and sediment and consequently groundwater would be expected to be negligible. Though diphenylamine is moderately volatile, significant concentrations in air would not be expected as this property will be counteracted by its moderate water solubility. Diphenylamine would not be expected to have the potential for long range atmospheric transport due to its expected potential for indirect photochemical oxidative degradation in the atmosphere. The submitted data suggest a low acute and short-term toxicity of diphenylamine to birds and a low acute toxicity to mammals. Exposure of birds and mammals from the representative use as an indoor drench treatment of apples is considered unlikely. Diphenylamine is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However exposure of aquatic organisms is considered to be negligible. Management measures tailored to local practice and legislation should be put in place to control the waste disposal of spent application solution and prevent accidental spillage entering sewers or surface water drains. No data were made available for other non-target organisms. However exposure of non-target organisms is assumed to be unlikely if the product is applied according to the GAP and studies are considered not necessary. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance zeta-cypermethrin Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.196r,"Zeta-cypermethrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on zeta-cypermethrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 July 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 October 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in October 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Fury 10 EW (NP Free)"", an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 100 g/L (96.9 g/kg) zeta-cypermethrin. The technical specification for the active substance was based on pilot scale production and was only partially accepted by the PRAPeR meeting of experts (May 2008). Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues. As for mammalian toxicology, the dossier submitted contained studies on both zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin. Considering the ratio of the most potent isomers between zeta-cypermethrin and cypermethrin and focusing on neurotoxicity (difference using the NOAELs and LOAELs of rat studies), a factor of 2 could be established showing that zeta-cypermethrin is more toxic than cypermethrin. When orally administered, zeta-cypermethrin is toxic (proposed to be classified T, R25 ""toxic if swallowed""). It is harmful for inhalation (Xn, R20). No toxic effects were observed after dermal exposure. It is not irritating to eyes or skin but is a skin sensitizer in a Buehler test (Xi, R43 - ""irritant; may cause sensitisation by skin contact""). Neurotoxicity is the target effect of zeta-cypermethrin for short term exposures. The relevant NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year feeding study in dogs. The classification as R48/22 (""danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure, if swallowed"") was proposed based on mortality in several studies. Overall, it was concluded that zeta-cypermethrin is neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic under experimental conditions (carcinogenicity was tested with cypermethrin). The relevant long term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day is from the 2-year rat study. The relevant parental and offspring NOAEL in multigeneration studies is 5.9 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL is 22 mg/kg bw/day. Zeta-cypermethrin was negative for developmental toxicity when tested in rats. The relevant maternal NOAEL in rat and rabbit are 12.5 and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day, respectively; the relevant developmental NOAEL are 35 mg/kg bw/day in rat, and >= 120 mg/kg bw/day in rabbit. Zeta-cypermethrin is a neurotoxic agent (acute and subchronic NOAELs 10 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day and a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin vs. cypermethrin. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.125 mg/kg bw based on the developmental toxicity study in rats supported by the acute neurotoxicity with zeta-cypermethrin, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. An acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the overall cypermethrin NOAEL for dogs of 7.5 mg/kg bw/day using a 100-fold safety factor with an additional factor of 2 for the higher toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and correcting for 50% oral absorption. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In order to support the uses of zeta-cypermethrin the applicant submitted plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Several groups of plants were investigated; root crops (sugar beet), cereals (maize), pulses/oilseeds (cotton), fruit crops (apples) and leafy crops (lettuce). The major degradation pathway of cypermethrin starts with the cleavage of the parent molecule to yield cis/trans DCVA(2) and the mPBAldehyde(3), this latter metabolite being further oxidised or reduced to the corresponding mPBAcid(4) or mPBAlcohol(5) followed by conjugations. In most of the plant matrices investigated, unchanged cypermethrin was the predominant residue accounting for more than c.a. 50% of the TRR. The meeting discussed whether the plant metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were relevant for zeta-cypermethrin and if a preferential metabolism may be suspected for some isomers with a special impact on toxicology. A bridging study on maize detailing the respective metabolism of both cypermethrin and zeta-cypermethrin was provided by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However, and taking into account the no residue situation resulting from the intended uses on cereals, maize and peas, the meeting was of the opinion that the possible isomeric conversion from less to more toxic isomers would not be significant and concluded that a residue definition can be proposed based on the metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin. Finally, it was concluded that a global residue definition has to be proposed in order to take into account the various mixtures of cypermethrin isomers available on the market. Thus, for plants, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"". Numerous supervised residue trials performed with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted to propose MRLs. Nevertheless, some of them were rejected since growth stages at application were not in compliance with the critical GAP and/or analytical methods were not sufficiently validated. Finally, MRLs were defined for wheat, triticale and pea without pods and, awaiting the evaluation of additional data provided by the applicant that were not considered during the meeting with regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, provisional MRLs were proposed for maize, barley, oat, pea with pods and pulses. No degradation of residues was observed for zeta-cypermethrin in different plant- and animal matrices when stored under frozen conditions for up to 18 months. Some instability was observed at some time points for the metabolites mPBAcid and cis-DCVA in some animal matrices, but globally, the results were considered acceptable. No processing studies were provided since no significant residues were observed in any commodities supporting the representative uses. However, the EFSA noted that the cypermethrin hydrolysis breakdown product, mPBAldehyde, was found in a tomato processing study, and this compound is suspected of endocrine activity. This concern was considered to be not relevant for the intended uses supported in the DAR but the meeting noted that this point has to be re-considered if additional uses are envisaged. Lactating cow and laying hen metabolism studies performed with cypermethrin were evaluated. The major route of degradation consisted of the hydrolysis of ester linkage to generate the cis and trans DCVA moiety and the mPBAldehyde that undergoes further oxidation and/or reduction to the corresponding acid (mPBAcid) or alcohol (mPBAlcohol) and their hydroxy products. The metabolism of the cyclopropyl moiety was considered as insufficiently investigated in the ruminant metabolism study as in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the additional data from literature presented in the addendum of May 2008, could not be considered in the peer review. This point remains open and has to be reconsidered. Nevertheless, and taking into account the complete metabolic pathway in poultry, and the data from the rat metabolism study indicating a similar pathway, the meeting of experts concluded that there was enough evidence to propose the residue for monitoring and risk assessment for animal products as ""cypermethrin, including other mixtures of constituent isomers (sum of isomers)"". Considering the potential livestock exposure to zeta-cypermethrin residues through consumption of treated feed items (maize, cereals, pea and pulses), feeding studies indicate that no measurable residues may be present above the LOQ in the different animal-products and the MRLs for animal commodities were proposed at LOQ values. Considering the representative uses and the toxicological endpoints set for zeta-cypermethrin, no chronic or acute concerns were observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 2% of the ADI and the maximum national estimated short term intake (NESTI) less than 1% of ARfD. In addition, the meeting concluded on the need for a global risk assessment taking into account the other sources of exposure resulting from the uses of all other cyprermethrin isomer mixtures available on the market and their respective toxicological reference values. In soil under aerobic conditions zeta-cypermethrin exhibits low to medium persistence forming the soil metabolites DCVA6 (accounting for up to 24% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low persistence and mPBAcid (accounting for up to 8.4 % AR in the available guideline study or 29.5% AR in a study with limited sampling intervals) which also exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl- and benzyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 25-27% AR after 91 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 12-26 % AR after 91 days. Isomers of cypermethrin are immobile in soil, DCVA exhibits very high mobility in soil and mPBAcid exhibits high to medium mobility. There was no indication that the soil adsorption of isomers of cypermethrin was pH dependent. There was no clear evidence that the soil adsorption of DCVA or mPBAcid was pH dependant. A data gap was identified for a satisfactory aerobic soil laboratory route of degradation study dosed with zeta-cypermethrin, which is necessary to ensure thatall potential soil metabolites that might reach levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment have been identified. The available route of degradation study that used cypermethrin as the test substance was considered insufficient to address the presence of zeta-cypermethrin metabolites at the 5% AR trigger for leaching assessment level as prescribed in agreed EU guidance. In dark natural sediment water systems zeta-cypermethrin partitioned rapidly from water to sediment where it degraded exhibiting low persistence to the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA, which were present predominantly in the water phase where they exhibited medium to high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 22 % AR (cyclopropyl label) and 58% AR (phenyl label) at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a significant sink representing 16-27 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for component isomers of the active substance at step 1. Step 3 and 4 calculations are also available (but only for surface water and not sediment), with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. However, these calculations did not adhere to the FOCUS surface water guidance, so a data gap is identified for more appropriate calculations, therefore only relatively crude estimates of surface water exposure are available for the aquatic risk assessment. For the metabolites mPBAcid and DCVA appropriate FOCUS step 1 exposure assessments were agreed by the peer review. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by component isomers of the active substance, mPBAcid and trans-DCVA above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However the groundwater exposure assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap identified for a satisfactory soil route of degradation study is filled. The risk to mammals and the acute and short-term risk to birds were assessed as low but a potential high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for all representative uses evaluated. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the risk assessment for insectivorous birds. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The aquatic risk assessment was based on preliminary FOCUS step 4 PECsw values which included a 20m no-spray buffer zone. The acute TERs for fish exceeded the Annex VI trigger of 100 in all scenarios for the use in cereals and in all scenarios except R3 and R4 for the use in peas. However no full scenario resulted in a TER of >100 for the use in maize and the long-term TERs were significantly below the Annex VI trigger of 10 in all scenarios even with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. A data gap was identified for further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment. Two mesocosm studies with zeta-cypermethrin were submitted by the applicant, however, in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from the metabolites cis-DCVA, trans-DCVA and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (mPBAcid) was assessed as low. Zeta-cypermethrin is very toxic to bees. A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. The mortality of adult bees was increased in higher tier tests during the first 1-4 days after treatment. No impact on bee brood development was observed but it was noted that no reserves were accumulated in the bee hives. This observation may be explained by the repellent effect of zeta-cypermethrin. The experts considered the risk to bees as low for the use in cereals which are considered as not attractive for bees. Risk mitigation measures such as no application during flowering were proposed for the use in peas. The higher tier studies did not cover the application rate in maize and a data gap was identified to address the risk to bees further. A high in-field risk to non-target arthropods was indicated from the standard laboratory and the extended laboratory tests. The applied doses in the field tests were too low for the representative uses and a data gap was identified to address further the in-field and the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for all representative uses. Although formally not triggered, the experts considered it necessary to address the risk to soil dwelling mites and collembola because of the potential high risk to arthropods. It was suggested that investigation of soil dwelling mites and collembola should be included in a field study with non-target arthropods. The study on effects on respiration of activated sewage sludge was assessed as not valid. A new study was submitted by the applicant but in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance aluminium phosphide Issued on 29 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.182r,"Aluminium phosphide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aluminium phosphide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 19 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 29 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants Casa Bernardo, Detia Freyberg GmbH and United Phosphorus Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, rodenticide, talpicide and leporicide as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Phostoxin Tabletten"", ""Quickphos tablet/pellets/bags 56 GE"", and ""Gastoxin"" gas generating products (GE). The gas phosphine that is produced is the true active ingredient. Pooling all the available data from all aluminium phosphide applicants a method of analysis for phosphine in products of plant origin is available; however ILV and a confirmatory method have been identified as a data gap. A method for products of animal origin is not required as MRLs have not been set. Methods for phosphine in soil are not required as the DT90 in soil is < 3 days for phosphine. A method is available for phosphine in water but a confirmatory method has been identified as a data gap. It should be noted however, that there is a confirmatory method in the magnesium phosphide DAR. The method of analysis for air did not have a low enough LOQ and a data gap was identified. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. The meeting of experts considered the specification and impurities on the basis that the spent pellets were contained and removed from the treated material. Therefore, given the toxicity of phosphine, possible relevant impurities were ignored. The case where the spent material is not removed has not been considered in the peer review process. The batch data and the specification for the Casa Bernardo sources were not accepted. Some data gaps for physchem data for the individual formulations were identified. The mammalian toxicology of aluminium phosphide was assessed in a series of tests. When coming into contact with moisture aluminium phosphide decomposes to aluminium hydroxide and phosphine, which is the toxicologically active ingredient and the relevant component for the assessment of mammalian toxicology of aluminium phosphide. Aluminium phosphide is classified as R29 ""Contact with water liberates toxic gas"" and R32 ""Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas"". Phosphine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. It is widely and evenly distributed in the body and has no potential for accumulation. Phosphine is excreted as such via expired air or with the urine in form of hypophosphite or phosphite. Aluminium phosphide is very toxic by the oral and inhalation route and harmful by the dermal route. It is neither a skin nor an eye irritant nor a skin sensitizer. Based on data on acute toxicity a classification as T+; R28 ""Very toxic if swallowed"", Xn; R21 ""Harmful in contact with skin"" and T+; R26 ""Very toxic by inhalation"" is proposed. A short term NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d (the highest dose tested, no adverse effects observed) was derived for phosphine from a rat 90-day inhalation study. Aluminium phosphide is not genotoxic. In a 2-year inhalation study with rats a NOAEL of 1.1 mg/kg bw/d was established for phosphine which was the highest dose level tested since no adverse effects were observed. A mouse carcinogenicity study was not carried out and not considered necessary based on the toxicity profile of the substance (lethality anticipated at low doses). In an inhalation developmental study with rats (a rabbit study was not provided) no specific developmental effects were observed and an overall NOAEL for phosphine of 1.9 mg/kg bw/d was set based on mortality occurring in dams. Effects on reproduction have not been assessed but are, based on the toxicity profile of the substance, not anticipated. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) have been set at 0.019 mg/kg bw/d. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was fixed at 0.032 mg/kg bw. The corresponding values for phosphine are 0.011 mg/kg bw/d (ADI and AOEL) and 0.019 mg/kg bw (ARfD). When applying aluminium phosphide containing formulations in rodent burrows without the use of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) maximum exposure levels amounted to 93% of the AOEL for operators, workers and bystanders, however more realistic exposure levels for workers and bystanders presented in the DAR accounted for 63% and 33% of the AOEL respectively. Application of aluminium phosphide in storage rooms when respiratory protective equipment is used amounted to 71% for operators and to 33% (or alternatively to 25%) for workers of the systemic AOEL. For unprotected bystanders a maximum value for exposure of 33% of the AOEL was derived. Two main uses of aluminium phosphide were evaluated, 1) as rodenticide, talpicide, leporicide to control rodent and non-rodent vertebrates by fumigation of underground tunnels and burrows in cropland and non-cropland situations, 2) as fumigant to control insects in various harvested plant products and in empty warehouses or transportation facilities. Due to its physico-chemical properties, no specific studies to evaluate metabolism and distribution of aluminium phosphide in treated commodities were submitted. In contact with soil or atmospheric moisture, aluminium phosphide is rapidly hydrolysed to produce phosphine (PH3) and aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)(3). After treatment the major part of phosphine is volatilised and diluted in air or oxidised to phosphorous oxyacids of no significant concern for human health. Considering stored fumigated commodities may contain residual gaseous phosphine and residual metal phosphide, the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set as ""phosphine and phosphine generators (relevant phosphide salts) determined and expressed as phosphine"". No residue trials were submitted to support the uses of aluminium phosphide as a rodenticide, considering that the direct application of the active substance into underground tunnels of rodent or non-rodent animals excludes the direct contact with plants and therefore, the possible residues in plants. For post harvest applications, in addition to the aeration period, the RMS proposed for each commodity or group of commodities a withholding period. Thus, during the meeting, the MRL proposals were not discussed on the basis of the residue levels observed at the end of the aeration period as stated in the GAP, but at the end of these additional withholding periods of 7 to 35 days, depending on the commodities. Consequently and after the meeting, EFSA was of the opinion that the fumigation practices have not been sufficiently defined to allow MRL setting, and considers the fact that the withholding periods were not clearly described in the intended GAP as a data gap. No storage stability study was provided considering that the inherent properties of phosphine lead to a low stability in stored products. No processing studies and no livestock metabolism and feeding studies were provided since no significant residues of aluminium phosphide and phosphine are expected in post harvested plant commodities. No rotational crop studies were submitted since no residues in soil are expected from the outdoor uses on rodent and non-rodent vertebrates. No chronic or acute risks to consumers are expected after fumigation of stored commodities with aluminium phosphide if a withholding period is taken into account in the GAP, and considering that the proposed MRL values do not reflect the critical GAPs as initially defined by the applicants. When placed in animal burrows (i.e. the soil environment) aluminium phosphide will rapidly hydrolyse producing phosphine gas and aluminium salts. The phosphine gas produced, which was shown to exhibit very low persistence, will volatilise to the atmosphere or adsorb to soil and be converted to phosphate anions. Any phosphine gas that reaches the upper atmosphere will be subject to indirect photooxidation to phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid that would be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition. The rate of indirect photooxidation of phosphine measured was rapid enough to indicate that phosphine will not be subject to long range atmospheric transport. The potential for groundwater exposure of aluminium phosphide and its breakdown products above the relevant parametric drinking water limits set out in the relevant EU legislation(2) was assessed as low from the applied for intended uses. There is a potential for surface water exposure by phosphine gas when treated target organism burrows are adjacent to surface water (via movement in the gas phase). A data gap was identified to better characterise this exposure potential. Due to the representative uses (applied outdoor directly into the burrow systems or indoor in food storage rooms), the exposure to non-target species was considered to be only local or negligible. On the basis of the potential exposure of surface water to phosphine where target organism burrows are adjacent to water bodies, the risk from the outdoor use to aquatic organisms needs to be addressed and therefore valid studies for invertebrates and algae should be provided. The risk to birds, mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non target macro- and micro- organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was expected to be low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metam Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.203r,"Metam is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 September 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main notifier Taminco. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide, fungicide, herbicide and insecticide by soil fumigation prior to the planting of carrot, lamb's lettuce, cucumber, aubergine, pepper, potato, strawberry, tomato and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Metam sodium 510 g/L"", soluble concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. However, it should be noted that the residue definition for plants and ground water are provisional. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is a data gap for the flash point of the TK. Storage stability data where the relevant impurities are analysed for was also identified as a data gap. Spectra are available for the relevant impurity MITC2 but not for the other relevant impurity DMTU3 so this has also to be a data gap. As MITC is currently not specified in the technical specification a new specification is needed. As for mammalian toxicology, metam sodium is harmful by oral ingestion and inhalation (R22 and R20 proposed). In irritation tests, metam sodium was not irritant to eyes but was corrosive to skin, therefore R34 (""Causes burns"") was proposed. Metam sodium is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). The relevant short term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, rats and mice, respectively. In particular, the occurrence of severe hepatotoxicity in dogs was considered to support the proposal of R48/22 (""Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"") to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Metam did not show any genotoxic potential, but caused angiosarcomas in mice, therefore R40 (""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") was proposed. The relevant long term NOAEL was 1.5 mg/kg bw/day based reduced bodyweight gain, specific lesion within the nasal passages, and changes in some haematology and spleen (haemosiderin depots) parameters in rats. In multigeneration tests, the relevant parental, reproductive and offspring NOAELs were 4, 12 and 4 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, metam sodium caused an increased incidence of variations and retardations at maternally toxic dose in rats and decreased number of live foetuses, increased number of dead implants in rabbits, with relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats of 5 mg/kg bw/day and of 5 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, in rabbits. The malformations occurred at low incidences (sometimes in singularity), but in a consistent manner, at the top-doses, in the presence of quite severe maternal toxicity. Effects were clearly treatment related and associated with maternal toxicity: the classification as R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"") was proposed for consideration to the ECHA. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study NOAEL with a Safety Factor (SF) 100; the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw based on an overall rat developmental toxicity NOAEL and supported by rabbit developmental study. MITC is toxic via ingestion (R25 proposed) and via inhalation (R23 proposed). It is harmful in contact with skin (R21 proposed). In skin irritation tests it was corrosive to skin (R34 proposed). It was also irritative to the respiratory system (R37 proposed). It is a skin sensitiser (R43 proposed). The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure to MITC is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the thymus involution and liver vacuolation at 0.4 mg/kg bw/day. MITC did not show any genotoxic, carcinogenic, reproductive and developmental toxicity potential. The relevant NOAEL for long term toxicity is 0.44 mg/kg bw/day based on haematological changes in rats; the relevant parental NOAEL is 0.7 mg/kg bw/day, the reproductive and offspring NOAEL is >3.6 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental toxicity NOAELs in rats are 3 and 10 mg/kg bw/day. The ADI and AOEL are 0.004 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1 year and 90-day studies in dog, respectively; the ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on NOAEL for rat maternal toxicity with SF 100. The operator exposure in open field is below the AOEL with the use of Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE); the bystander and worker exposure in the open field is below the AOEL without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered the impurity DMTU as relevant, due to the lack of toxicological information. Metabolism studies were supplied but no metabolites were identified. It was noted that the majority of the metabolism studies were under dosed. The meeting of experts considered the under dosing and lack of identification. It was concluded that as long as fate and behaviour had not identified any significant metabolites in soil then the metabolism data could be accepted. At this time fate and behaviour are unable to conclude on this issue and therefore a data gap has been set to address this. As some of the impurities in the technical material are applied at significant levels the consumer risk for the impurities still has to be addressed. A data gap for new residue trials was identified. Currently the need for processing studies, rotational crops and livestock studies are not triggered. However, this is subject to the data gaps. The risk assessment can not be finalised and MRLs can not be proposed at this time as the residue trials data are identified as a data gap. Degradation of metam and its known active metabolite MITC in soil was investigated in four soils under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. The experts in the meeting were not confident that these experiments provided a realistic representation of the fate and behaviour of metam and MITC in soil mainly due to the mode of application used in the study with respect to the application in field where volatilization is minimized by compacting soil or with plastic films. However, the meeting noted that a number of scientific studies investigating the persistence of metam and MITC are available in the public domain and to regulatory authorities. Consequently, a data gap was identified by the meeting of experts to address the range of half-lives available for metam and MITC and whether they are applicable to metam EU risk assessment. The notifier should address the different variables that might impact on the degradation in soil, such as method of application dose rate and soil adaptation. Taking into consideration the application rates of metam (306 612 kg / ha), during the peer review it was considered that impurities need to be addressed for the potential environmental and ground water contamination. The notifier submitted an overview of the main impurities present in the technical material that was summarized by the RMS in the addendum (June 2008). The meeting of experts in toxicology agreed that the impurity DMTU should be regarded as toxicological relevant and therefore a will need a ground water exposure assessment. PEC soil for metam and MITC were calculated for the worst case use in field tomato (612 kg a.s. / ha) assuming 15 cm incorporation. Time dependent PEC soil need to be updated once the data gaps identified for persistence in soil are solved. Initial PECs in soil may be used for the EU risk assessment. Mobility of metam was investigated by the HPLC method. According this experiment metam may be considered to be very high mobile in soil. A batch adsorption / desorption study is available for MITC in four soils. This compound was very high mobile in these soils (K-foc = 27 mL / g). The meeting of experts concluded that adsorption in this study may have been overestimated due to the fact that experimental K-oc values are simultaneously affected by degradation and volatilization during the experiment. Therefore, the meeting of experts proposed a data gap for a new soil adsorption desorption study conducted with consideration of the volatility and the low adsorption properties of MITC (e.g. with shorter equilibration times, soil solution ratios of 1:1, high organic carbon soils). After the meeting of experts, a new data gap has been identified by EFSA to address the mobility of impurity DMTU in soil in order to obtain adequate input parameters for ground water modelling. Hydrolysis of metam is relatively fast at any pH. Hydrolysis of MITC at 25 degrees C occurs with half-lives of approximate to 40 d (pH 4), 50 d (pH 7) and 11 d (pH 9). Major hydrolysis products of MITC were DMU, DMTU and MDTA (metam). The fact that one of the major metabolites of MITC is metam indicates that in water metam and MITC are in equilibrium. Aqueous photolysis of metam under simulated sunlight is very fast (DT50 = 12 min; equivalent to 27.8 min at 38 degrees N). No readily biodegradation study is available and therefore the substance is considered to be non readily biodegradable. In the aerobic water /sediment experiment (25 degrees C) metam degrades rapidly in the whole system (DT50whole system = 0.32 h). The meeting agreed that the information provided by the notifier did not allow any quantitative estimation of the effect of temperature on the volatilization. Consequently, the meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the effect of temperature on the dissipation of MITC from water by volatilization. Depending on the results of the volatilization assessment, a new water sediment study at lower temperature may be necessary. The data from the anaerobic water sediment study were considered not relevant for the representative uses and it was not found scientifically justified to average dissipation rates from aerobic and anaerobic experiments Due to the data gaps identified on the derivation of various key modelling input parameters and to the fact that FOCUS SW modelling does not consider volatilization-deposition route of entry in surface water, the available PECSW were not considered appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for worst case PECSW estimations of MITC taking into consideration short range transport and deposition to surface water bodies and potential exposure via drainage with adequate input parameters. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate MITC PECGW values with adequate input parameters (when available) using FOCUS GW or higher tier approach if appropriate. After the meeting of experts, a new data gap has been identified by EFSA to address the potential ground water contamination of impurity DMTU. The meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the atmospheric fate and behaviour of MITC including global warming (ozone depletion), long range transport and deposition, and to address the potential contamination of surface water and soil by deposition in the vicinity of the applied areas. The notifier and the RMS proposed in the DAR that due to the method of application of metam-sodium, the risk to birds and mammals was considered acceptable for the intended field uses. Member States experts suggested that the most probable contaminated food items for birds and mammals would be the soil invertebrates (including earthworms). The experts in the PRAPeR 53 agreed that the notifier should provide an acute risk assessment to assess the effects of metam-sodium and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates feeding on soil invertebrates. The acute risk assessment should also be provided for the metabolite MITC using the lowest endpoint available of 100 mg a.s./kg bw, which was agreed during the meeting. Metam-sodium and its relevant metabolite MITC were very toxic to aquatic organisms based on the available data. Due to the rapid degradation of metam-sodium in soil, surface water contamination with the parent molecule could be excluded. Aquatic organisms may be exposed to the metabolite MITC as result of the drainage and run-off. The experts in the Fate and Behaviour meeting agreed that the PECsw for the MITC should be re-estimated by the notifier. As a consequence the aquatic risk assessment should be revisited, once the new PECsw could be available. An extended laboratory study was conducted with Aloechara bilineata and this aged residue study demonstrated that A. bilineata was able to recolonise the field after 55 days. From an extended laboratory study it was only possible to assess the potential for re-colonisation, but not the actual recovery. Therefore, the experts agreed that further refinement was required to address the recovery potential of the non-target arthropods and soil non-target macro-organisms. An earthworm field study was conducted with the metam-sodium. The experts agreed that after the application of the 608.4 kg a.s./ha, there was no clear indication of full recovery after one year. A further refinement was required from the notifier to address concerns on recovery/recolonisation of earthworms this should be include considerations on effects on recovery of different ecological groups as well as known data on migration distances. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to other soil macro-organisms should be addressed. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to bees, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low from out-doors uses. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low in greenhouse uses.",NA
NA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bensulfuron Issued on 26 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.178r,"Bensulfuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within 6 months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bensulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 24 November 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May-June 2008 A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of broad-leaved weeds and Cyperaceae as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Londax (R), a water-dispersible granule (WG) containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl which is a variant of bensulfuron(2). The technical specification is not finalised, a data gap was identified for a revised specification. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor bensulfuron-methyl residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil, surface water and air; however no monitoring methods were submitted for the metabolites set as part of the residue definition in ground water. An analytical method for food of animal origin is not required due to the fact that no residue definition is proposed. In the mammalian metabolism studies, bensulfuron-methyl was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was distributed mainly to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys and plasma and was extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no skin sensitisation potential was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. The main target organ of bensulfuron-methyl was the liver upon short term or long term exposure in either the rat, mouse or dog species; the relevant NOAEL for both short term and long term exposure was the dose level of 19.9 mg/kg bw/day from the one-year dog study. No potential for neurotoxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity was seen with bensulfuron-methyl; no reproductive or fertility effects were observed in a two-generation reproduction toxicity study. Some unspecific effects or delay in the development of rats were observed upon high dosing of bensulfuron-methyl without expressing maternal toxicity, in rabbits only decreased body weight was observed at maternal toxic doses. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of bensulfuron-methyl was 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.12 mg/kg bw/day based on the same 1-year dog study, safety factor of 100, and applying a correction factor of 60 % for low oral absorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 5.9 % for the concentrate representative formulation and 7.2 % for the in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in rat. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation Londax (R) (a water dispersible granule (WG) formulation containing 600 g/kg of bensulfuron-methyl), at a maximum dose rate of 0.06 kg bensulfuron-methyl/ha in rice was below the AOEL according to the UK POEM, only when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered; according to the German model, estimated exposure was below the AOEL even when no PPE were worn. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with bensulfuron-methyl was below the AOEL, without the use of PPE. Bystander exposure was low compared to the AOEL value. In metabolism studies with radio labelled bensulfuron-methyl in paddy rice, upon application to the water surface, levels of total radioactivity recovered in rice plants were very low and hence identification of residues was limited to the extractable radioactivity from foliage and straw. Neither intact bensulfuron-methyl nor bensulfuron was detected, but, though at very low levels, some metabolites could be identified that indicate a cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge occurred. In the meeting of experts the need for further data on the nature of the residue in plants with foliar exposure and in rotational crops was identified. Therefore a residue definition for risk assessment and MRL setting purposes could only be proposed provisionally as bensulfuron-methyl. Residue trials with post-emergence application to rice plants indicate that under practical conditions, residues of bensulfuron-methyl above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are not expected in rice grain, while in rice straw residues above the LOQ could be found in one trial. In a confined rotational crop study total residues in the rotated crops did not exceed 0.01 mg/kg, however data indicated an increase of residues in rotated cereals with time and thus clarification on potential uptake of soil metabolites is required. No significant residues are expected to occur in commodities to be processed or used in livestock diet, and therefore no further investigation in processing studies and livestock studies is required to support the representative uses in rice. In a provisional chronic consumer exposure and risk assessment, based on the provisional residue definition for risk assessment, it was demonstrated that the maximum estimated dietary intake of residues of bensulfuron-methyl is well below (<1%) the toxicological reference value ADI. As no ARfD was allocated an acute risk assessment is not considered necessary. Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in aerobic soil and aerobic natural sediment water systems it was identified that bensulfuron-methyl and the breakdown products IN-F78803 (max 9.7% applied radioactivity (AR) in whole natural sediment water systems), bensulfuron (max 27.7% AR in soil), IN-J02904(max 46% AR in soil), IN-N52975 (max 31.7% AR in whole natural sediment water systems), IN-DAT976 (max 9.9% AR in whole natural sediment water systems) and IN-D1R847 (max 18.2% AR in soil) needed environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised natural water (indirect) aqueous photolysis study IN-T58318 was formed at up to 13.7% AR. An environmental exposure assessment was also completed for this metabolite. These observed formation fractions were used as the basis for calculating the available environmental exposure assessments. Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting moderate to high persistence, IN-F7880 low to medium persistence, bensulfuron low to moderate persistence, IN-J0290 low to moderate persistence, IN-N5297 low to medium persistence, IN-T5831 no data available but considered to have moderate persistence on the basis of structural similarity to IN-J0290, IN-DAT97 moderate persistence and IN-D1R84 low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenyl and pyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 12-39% AR after 95-119 days and 2-25% AR after 95-119 days respectively in the available aerobic studies. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 11-37 % AR (same radiolabels, results amalgamated) after 95-119 days in these studies. A data gap was identified for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions). Bensulfuron-methyl was characterised as exhibiting medium to low mobility, IN-F7880 high to medium mobility, bensulfuron very high to low mobility, IN-J0290 high to low mobility, IN-N5297 very high to high mobility, and IN-D1R84 very high mobility. For IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 no experimental data were available and a data gap was identified. The environmental exposure assessment was completed assuming that these two compounds (IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97) exhibited very high mobility. Using this assumption the assessment indicated that mitigation to reduce the potential for the exposure of groundwater may be necessary for these two metabolites for one of the applied for intended uses in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand groundwater scenario. The information available was insufficient to enable a satisfactory environmental exposure assessment to be completed in line with agreed MED-Rice (2003) guidance(9), due to the data gaps identified above. A triggered higher tier exposure assessment for bensulfuron-methyl regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice sand soil scenario and for all scenarios where application is made before sowing the rice crop is missing. Whilst a higher tier exposure assessment regarding natural surface water and sediment for situations represented by the MED-Rice clay soil scenario for bensulfuron-methyl and post planting applications is available, the Member State experts did not accept the soil DT50 used as input (field dissipation value) to the RICEWQ module of the simulations or the way the exposure concentrations (90th percentile 14 day TWA values) provided by the applicant had been calculated. The experts agreed that there was a data gap for 90th percentile 14 day TWA values to be represented in a way that has some meaning for an edge of field risk assessment. The approach used by the applicant in the available assessment mixed temporal and spatial factors in an inappropriate way, such that the resulting aquatic risk assessment does not demonstrate in which (if any) situations the active substance might be used without impacting on populations of aquatic species, which is what Member State experts agreed would be required to demonstrate compliance with annex VI criteria. It can be concluded that the potential for bensulfuron-methyl to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the known metabolites, based on the available data, there are indications that this is also the case when applications are made to paddies with a 10cm layer of water overlying the soil and for shallower paddy water depths in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario where applications are made to paddies with <10cm overlying water it cannot be excluded with the available data that IN-5297, IN-T5831 and IN-DAT97 may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non relevance assessment for these three metabolites was triggered, but these are not available. In the absence of data to assess the non relevance of these metabolites, the available groundwater exposure assessments indicate that risk management options may be effective at mitigating the potential for groundwater exposure by these metabolites in regions represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario. However the groundwater assessment for metabolites cannot be finalised until the data gap for experimental data on the route and rate of degradation of bensulfuron-methyl under aerobic flooded soil conditions (that needs to include alkali soil conditions) has been filled. Bensulfuron-methyl is used as a herbicide and it is very toxic to aquatic and terrestrial plants. A low risk to the aquatic environment (algae and macrophytes) was not demonstrated using the submitted data and further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to non-target terrestrial plants in the off-field area needs to be mitigated. Risk mitigation comparable to an in-field no-spray buffer zone of 5 m is required to protect non-target terrestrial plants. The risk to birds, mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance chlormequat (considered variant chlormequat chloride),2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.179r,"Chlormequat is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on chlormequat in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 27 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant task force, comprising BASF AG, CIBA Speciality Chemicals, NUFARM GmbH & Co KG and Taminco SA. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as plant growth regulator in cereals for stem stabilisation as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Chlormequat-chloride 750 g/L', a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 750 g/l chlormequat chloride. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant origin, soil and air. There are no adequate methods available to monitor chlormequat in animal products and in water. With regard to the evaluation of the toxicological properties, the studies were performed with chlormequat chloride. The active substance was extensively absorbed, barely metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly by urine. The acute toxicity results with rats (after oral administration) and rabbits (after dermal administration) triggered the classification Xn, R21/22 ""Harmful in contact with skin and if swallowed"". In repeated dose studies, the dog appeared to be the most sensitive species, showing neuropharmacological effects, with an overall NOAEL of 4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year study. In mutagenicity and long-term tests, chlormequat chloride was not shown to have any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties. During the reproductive toxicity testing, fertility was affected at a maternal toxic dose level, leading to an overall parental NOAEL of 75 mg/kg bw/day and a reproductive NOAEL of 74 mg/kg bw/day. However, based on reduced body weight gain and focal muscular dystrophy, the offspring NOAEL was 41 mg/kg bw/day. No variations, retardations or malformations were observed in the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, and the maternal NOAEL was 75 mg/kg bw/day in rats and 20 mg/kg bw/day in rabbits. In mechanistic studies in vitro for neurotoxicity, chlormequat chloride showed a weak agonistic activity on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. With regard to the toxicological reference values, the agreed values reported as chlormequat chloride were 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), 0.04 mg/kg bw/day for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and 0.09 mg/kg bw for the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The dermal absorption values were 4% for the concentrate and the dilution, based on an in vivo test. The operator exposure estimates were below the AOEL according to the German model with the use of personal protective equipment, but above the AOEL according to the UK POEM even with the use of personal protective equipment. The different exposure estimates for the worker and the bystander led to values below the AOEL. With regard to residues, the metabolism of chlormequat chloride was investigated in wheat. The major component in grain and straw at harvest was unmetabolised chlormequat. Rotational crops data show that significant residues in succeeding and rotational crops are not expected to occur except in rotated cereals. However residues should not be higher than in cereals directly treated with chlormequat chloride according to the notified GAP. Currently, according to the conclusion of the expert meeting, only the use of chlormequat chloride on rye and triticale in Northern Europe would be supported by a sufficient number of residue trials to allow at least a provisional proposal of maximum residue levels (MRL) whereas uses have also been notified for wheat, barley and oats and also for use in Southern Europe. It is noted that the rapporteur Member State does not agree with this conclusion. Data gaps for further residue trials for all notified uses have been identified. On the basis of processing studies, processing factors have been calculated. After evaluation of animal metabolism studies and animal transfer studies with ruminants and poultry, MRLs for animal products have been provisionally proposed pending the submission of residue trials on primary crops and the demonstration of the validity of the analytical method used in feeding studies. If the use of chlormequat chloride on only rye and triticale is considered in a provisional calculation, then the consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However it is noted that the risk assessment does not cover the intake of barley, oats and wheat and therefore it is only indicative and the final assessment is pending submission of additional data. With regard to the environmental fate and behaviour data, no significant metabolites were identified in laboratory aerobic route and rate of degradation studies using [chloroethyl-U-C-14] labelled chlormequat chloride. However a minor unidentified non-transient metabolite was found above 5% at two consecutive occasions. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 19-28% of the applied radioactivity (AR) after 112 days, while significant mineralisation was observed (28.3-61.1% after 112 days). Chlormequat chloride exhibited moderate persistency in soil, first-order DT50 values were in the range from 27 to 34 days. The peer review concluded that no reliable data were available regarding the mobility of chlormequat chloride. In dark natural water sediment systems chlormequat chloride degraded exhibiting low persistence without forming major metabolites. Peak partitioning of chlormequat chloride to the sediment was measured 30 days after dosing at a maximum of 63.3% AR. Mineralisation was significant and by the termination of the study (CO2)-C-14 represented 55.6-67.0% AR. Based on the calculated photochemical oxidative degradation, air is not a likely route of environmental contamination by chlormequat chloride. No reliable FOCUS calculations regarding the predicted environmental concentrations in surface water and sediment as well as for the leaching potential were available. A potential high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment for birds and mammals except for the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals. The refined risk assessment based on measured residues in plants resulted in TERs above the trigger for herbivorous birds. However the long-term risk assessment to insectivorous birds needs further refinement. The acute risk to insectivorous mammals and small herbivorous mammals and the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals were not sufficiently addressed and need further refinement. The log Pow of chlormequat chloride was less than 3 and therefore no risk assessment is triggered for secondary poisoning of fish-and earthworm-eating birds and mammals. No major metabolites were found in plants and hence no risk assessment for the uptake of plant metabolites was conducted. Daphnia magna was the most sensitive aquatic species tested. The FOCUS step 1 calculations resulted in TERs above the trigger of 100 and 10 for fish, algae and higher aquatic plants but not for daphnids. The TERs for daphnids exceeded the Annex VI trigger values by a factor of 3.5 (acute) and 2.6 (chronic) with FOCUS step 2 PECSW values. However there is some uncertainty with regard to the reliability of the PECSW water values since the adsorption/desorption study was conducted at too low temperatures. If the new PECSW values would be increased by more than 2.6 times then further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment would be needed (e.g. FOCUS step 3 or step 4 calculations). A final conclusion on the risk to aquatic organisms can be drawn once reliable PECSW values are available. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, non-target macro-and micro-organisms, nontarget plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all representative uses.",NA
[Anonymous],CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance chlorsulfuron Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.201r,"Chlorsulfuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021.

This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on wheat, barley, oats, rye and triticale. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Chlorsulfuron 75 WG"", a water dispersible granule (WG). Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification could not be agreed, two impurities were found to be relevant but the maximum content has not been agreed. For the relevant impurities data gaps have been identified for spectra, storage and methods of analysis. A shelf life study was identified as a data gap for the product in water soluble bags. With regard to its toxicological properties, chlorsulfuron was rapidly but not extensively absorbed after oral administration. Widely distributed in the rat body, it did not accumulate in any organ and was excreted mainly via urine as parent, with two minor metabolites. Of low acute toxicity, chlorsulfuron was not a skin irritant, slightly irritating to the eye and did not induce skin sensitisation. The short term toxicity was manifested by an increased testicular weight (rats), decreased body weight gain and haematological changes (dogs). Chlorsulfuron was not shown to have a genotoxic potential in vivo, but induced testicular interstitial cell tumours in the 2-year rat study leading to the proposed classification as Carcinogen Category 3, R40 (Limited evidence of carcinogenic effects). In the reproductive toxicity studies, effects on the reproductive organs were observed without impact on the fertility parameters and were considered as related to general systemic toxicity. No effect in the offspring was observed up to the highest dose tested. Similarly in the developmental toxicity studies, some effects on the foetal development were considered as a result of maternal toxicity at the high dose level, and it was agreed that chlorsulfuron had no teratogenic properties. Several metabolites/ impurities were evaluated in the DAR and considered by the experts. The compound IN-A40972 was concluded to be a relevant groundwater metabolite and a relevant impurity. Based on the available information, there is no sufficient evidence demonstrating the absence of carcinogenic properties. The agreed ADI for IN-A4097 is 0.009 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day rat study with a safety factor of 1000. Based on acute toxicity results, the impurity IN-A4098(3) was considered as toxicologically relevant. As it is a potential metabolite, it was agreed that the reference values of the parent could be applied. Based on the available information, the other potential groundwater metabolites, not discussed by the experts, should also be considered as toxicologically relevant pending on the confirmation of the proposed classification of chlorsulfuron as Carcinogen Category 3 by ECHA. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) for chlorsulfuron is 0.2 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.43 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, the application of a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor for oral absorption of 71%. It was agreed that no acute reference dose (ARfD) was needed for chlorsulfuron. The default value of 100% was agreed for dermal absorption in the absence of experimental values. The operator exposure levels estimated with the UK and German models resulted in values below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment. Similarly, estimated worker and bystander exposure levels were respectively below 5 and 1% of the AOEL for the representative use on cereals. The metabolism of chlorsulfuron was investigated in cereals. Chlorsulfuron is metabolised extensively, mainly by hydroxylation followed by conjugation to glucose and by cleavage of the sulfonylurea linkage. Although the submitted residue trials were not carried out fully in accordance with the notified cGAP they were regarded as sufficient to propose an MRL for cereals taking into account that residues of chlorsulfuron in all grain samples were below LOQ. Data on the metabolism in rotational crops show that no quantifiable residues of chlorsulfuron or the soil metabolite IN-A4098 are expected in rotational crops after application of chlorsulfuron according to the notified GAP. However, a data gap was set concerning the investigation of the possible presence of two further soil metabolites in rotational crops (IN-A4097 and IN-J998(4)). The metabolite IN-A4097 which was found in the metabolism studies was regarded as toxicologically relevant. It was included in the proposed residue definition for risk assessment for products of plant and animal origin which should be carried out separately for chlorsulfuron and the metabolite. The risk assessment for the consumer for both was not peer reviewed. For IN-A4097 residue levels in cereal grain after application have not been analysed and can only be estimated on the basis of results from a metabolism study. According to provisional calculations the chronic exposure from intake of cereals is expected to be well below the ADI for chlorsulfuron and for IN-A4097. According to preliminary FOCUS calculations, concentrations of IN-A4097 are expected to exceed 0.1 mu g/L in ground water. IN-A4097 is considered as a relevant metabolite according to draft guidance document SANCO/221/2000-rev. 10 on the basis of the conclusions of the toxicological evaluation. Degradation of chlorsulfuron was very limited in the particular soil used to investigate the route of degradation under aerobic conditions (DT50 (lab 20 degrees C) = 232 d). Only two metabolites exceeded 5 % AR at two consecutive data points: IN-JJ998, IN-A40985. Other two minor metabolites were increasing in amount at the end of the study: IN-A4097 and IN-M69576. Additionally, the applicant presented a position paper reviewing published scientific literature that contains up to 25 chlorsulfuron degradation rate determinations in soil (DT50 = 6.7 - 232 d). The submission of the original papers that support these data was identified as a data gap during the peer review. Furthermore, EFSA identified some shortcomings on the kinetic assessment of these data provided after the meeting of experts. Some of the papers were based on applicants' studies not directly available in the dossier. The submission and assessment of these studies has also been identified as a data gap. Taking into consideration the relatively low degradation of parent observed in the laboratory route study it may not be excluded that the trigger values for soil assessment and / or ground water exposure assessment are exceeded in less extreme soils by these or other metabolites. Soil metabolites reach significantly higher levels in some of the field studies available (IN-A4097 up to 77.5 % AR, IN-A4098 up to 65.9 % AR and IN-JJ998 up to 26.7 % AR). Metabolite IN-A4097 may be considered high to very high persistent in soil (DT50 = 175 - 436 d) under dark aerobic conditions according the available studies. Metabolite IN-A4098 may be considered moderated medium persistent in soil (DT50 lab = 43.2 - 65.9 d) under dark aerobic conditions according to the available information as updated by the RMS after the meeting of experts. Metabolite IN-JJ998 may be considered medium to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 91.6 - 107.4 d) under dark aerobic conditions according the available information as updated by the RMS after the meeting of experts. Half lives of metabolites IN-A4098 and IN-JJ998 may not be considered fully peer reviewed. The degradation of chlorsulfuron was also investigated under dark anaerobic conditions at 25 degrees C (DT50 (lab 20 degrees C) anaerobic = 78.2 d). Major metabolite IN-D5293(7) (max. 14 % AR after 56 d) not identified under aerobic conditions was found in the anaerobic study. Half life of chlorsulfuron in the photolysis in soil study was calculated to be 62.2 d. A data gap was identified during the peer review to provide an estimation of soil photolysis half lives at different latitudes (35 - 55 degrees N). A specific photolysis metabolite (IN-V71608) was identified in this study. Field dissipation studies performed in California, Idaho (USA), Spain and Italy (2 sites) are available in the dossier. After the examination of these studies, the experts in the meeting agreed that the studies are not suitable to derive kinetic parameters for modelling purposes. According the batch soil adsorption / desorption studies available chlorsulfuron may be considered to exhibit high to very high mobility in soil (K-fOC = 14.1 - 60.2 mL / g), IN-A4097 may be considered to exhibit very high mobility in soil (K-fOC = 21.2 - 48.2 mL / g), IN-A4098 may be considered to exhibit very high to medium mobility in soil (K-fOC = 16.7 - 225.5 mL / g) and IN-JJ998 may be considered to exhibit high to very high mobility (K-fOC = 14.7 - 114.0 mL / g). According estimations obtained using PCKOCWIN metabolites IN-B5528(9) and IN-V7160 are very highly mobile in soil and IN-M6957 may be considered low mobile in soil. Chlorsulfuron is stable to hydrolysis at pH 7 and 9 and it hydrolysis with a half life of 23.2 d at pH 5. Photolysis in water is not considered to contribute significantly to its environmental degradation. Chlorsulfuron was found not to be readily biodegradable. Dissipation / degradation of chlorsulfuron in the aquatic environment were investigated in one study with one aerobic and one anaerobic water / sediment system. The experiment's design deviate significantly from the recommendations given by SETAC guidance and a data gap for an additional water sediment study has been identified by EFSA. The meeting of experts had already identified a data gap (considered not essential to finalize the EU risk assessment) for a new water / sediment study under acidic conditions. PECs (SW/SED) presented in the DAR were not validated during the peer review due to the lack of adequate input parameters. Therefore, a new data gap was identified for new PEC (SW/SED). Meeting of experts discussed the FOCUS GW calculations as presented in addendum 3. In these calculations, chlorsulfuron and metabolites IN-JJ998 and IN-A4097 exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L in some of the scenarios simulated. Metabolite IN-A4097 also exceeds the trigger of 0.75 mu g / L in some of the scenarios. Due to various deficiencies and data gaps, the calculations presented were not validated during the peer review and the ground water exposure assessment remains open. Chlorsulfuron is not expected to volatilize significantly under normal environmental conditions. Half life in the atmosphere due to photochemical degradation has been estimated to be of 2.1 d. For the representative use of chlorsulfuron a low risk was assessed for terrestrial vertebrates in a firsttier assessment. Algae and aquatic plants were the most sensitive organisms. Risk assessment was driven by Lemna gibba, for which potential higher first-tier risk was identified. The higher tier TER calculations provided did not allow to identify a low risk. Furthermore, new PECsw FOCUS step 3 values were requested by the fate expert meeting. Therefore a data gap was identified to calculate FOCUS Step 3&4 TER values in order to address the risk to macrophytes and to identify the most appropriate mitigation measures. Only if mitigation measures equivalent to an in-field non-spray buffer zone of 15 m (pre-emergence use) and 15 m plus a drift reduction >= 50% (post emergence use) are applied, the risk to terrestrial non-target plants was assessed as low. In order identify more realistic mitigation measures, EFSA proposed a data gap for the risk assessment for non target plants. A low risk was assessed for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworm, soil non-target macro and microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment.",NA
[Anonymous],CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of propaquizafop (an ester variant of quizalofop-P) Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.204r,"Propaquizafop is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on propaquizafop in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 22 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 12 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the sole notifier Makhteshim Agan and the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. Propaquizafop is an ester variant of the active substance quizalofop-P-2 which is included in the third stage Part B of the review programme. The EFSA wrote a conclusion on quizalofop-P based on the DARs which were submitted on the ester variants quizalofop-P-ethyl(3) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl.(4) This conclusion on propaquizafop was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on sugar beet and oilseed rape. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Agil 100 EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). The meeting of experts was not able to conclude on the acceptability of any of the methods as none of the methods were capable of analysing for the original residue definition proposed in the DAR. As it is not possible to reconsider all the methods at this time no conclusion can be reached. A general data gap for reconsideration of the methods has been identified. There are insufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification of the technical material has not been accepted. The method of analysis for the formulation is identified as a data gap. The formulation was seen to perform poorly in some of the physical-chemical tests. And there are outstanding issues on possible relevant impurities. In mammals, propaquizafop shows a low acute toxicity via the oral and dermal routes, as well as via inhalation; it is non-irritating to the skin and eyes. Skin sensitisation tests in guinea pigs gave positive results (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed). In repeated dose studies, liver was shown to be the target organ. The short-term toxicity No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for rats and mice were 6.25 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, on the basis of liver effects (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Levels - LOAELs 25 and 30 mg/kg bw/day, respectively); in long-term studies the relevant NOAELs were set at 5 mg/kg bw/day for rats and 1.5 mg/kg bw/day for mice (LOAELs 25 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). Propaquizafop did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were seen in both rats and mice. In one study in rats, an increase in Leydig cell tumours was also noted. Mechanistic studies performed in rats and mice indicate that propaquizafop acts as a peroxisome proliferator. Based on the occurrence of malignant tumours in two species (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in rats and mice) and on an increased incidence of Leydig cell tumours in rats, proposal for classification and labelling of propaquizafop as Carc. Cat. 3 R40(""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") was considered and proposed during the meeting. In a multigeneration reproductive toxicity study, there were no treatment-related effects on mating performance, fertility index, gestation length or gestation index. The relevant reproductive NOAEL was 15 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the relevant maternal and offspring NOAEL were 3 mg/kg bw/day. In a rat developmental study, numbers of implantations, corpora lutea and viable foetuses were comparable among groups. No treatment-related skeletal malformations were observed in any dose group. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 20 mg/kg bw/day based on an increased incidence of dilated renal pelvis up to 50 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 50 mg/kg bw/day due to decreased body weight gain at 125 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, there were no treatment related malformations or developmental changes. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs were 6 mg/kg bw/day and 18 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.015 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL of 1.5 mg/kg bw/day from the mouse long-term study ( Safety Factor (SF): 100); the NOAEL of 6.25 mg/kg bw/day from the rat 90 day study was the basis for the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, SF 100 and limited oral absorption (65%). Based on the acute toxicological profile of the propaquizafop, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not allocated. The operator, worker and bystander exposure assessment is below the AOEL even without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The metabolism of propaquizafop has been investigated in cotton, soybean, lettuce and sugar beet using C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the phenyl and/or the quinoxaline moiety. The metabolism proceeds primarily with the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to quizalofop-phenol(5), these metabolites being also observed as conjugates. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving hydroxy-quizalofop(6) and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol(7). In addition and in a limited extent, the presence of quinoxaline metabolites and phenoxy acid metabolites indicated a cleavage of the oxygen bond of the molecule. In the sugar beet study, the metabolites quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, hydroxy-quinoxaline(8) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline(9) were detected in leaves and roots in similar proportions to propaquizafop and quizalofop. However, taking into account the overall low residue levels expected in leaves and roots at harvest, these metabolites were not included in the plant residue definition. Finally, considering that the radioactivity was not sufficiently characterized in sugar beet and in cotton seeds the notifier was asked to provide clarifications on the uncharacterized radioactivity, otherwise a new metabolism studies on root crop on oilseed crop should be submitted. In conclusion and provisionally the experts proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment: ""Sum of propaquizafop and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"". Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop esters, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as: ""Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"". These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested information on the toxicological relevance of the phenoxy metabolites observed in the quizalofop-P-ethyl studies. After the meeting, the EFSA was however of the opinion that there is no need to include the conjugates in the residue definition for monitoring. Supervised residue trials were submitted to support representative uses on rape seed and sugar beet. Samples were analysed using a method covering propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol. Although this method was not strictly in line with the residue definition, results were considered as valid since the scope of this method was wider than the proposed residue definitions. The storage stability study showed the residues of propaquizafop, quizalofop and quizalofop-phenol to be stable under deep freeze storage conditions for at least 2 years in soya, rapeseed and tomato matrices. The behaviour of the residues in processing products was not investigated due to the low residue levels detected in the raw agricultural products. A rotational crop study performed with C-14-propaquizafop labelled on the quinoxaline moiety was provided. Propaquizafop was not observed in the different rotational plant parts investigated and the detected metabolites (quizalofop, quizalofop-phenol and their hydroxy derivatives) have also been identified in the primary crop studies, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Taking into account the residue levels observed in plants at harvest, it was concluded that no significant residues of propaquizafop or its metabolites are expected in rotational crops. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hen were provided. However, the meeting of experts concluded that no residue definitions can be established on the basis of these studies since the characterisation of the radioactivity was not sufficiently investigated in some matrices, especially in fat. However, and taking into account the low residues levels observed in rapeseed and sugar beet, the experts agreed that there is no need to set a residue definition in products of animal origin for propaquizafop at the moment. No feeding study was provided, the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg in diet being not exceeded. Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl and propaquizafop, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study on pig should be requested. The metabolism in rats and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis and the notifiers were asked to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. Such request is not relevant for propaquizafop at the moment, but this point would have to be considered if new uses beyond those supported in this review lead to a significant residue intake by animals. No chronic risk for the consumer resulting from the use of propaquizafop according to the representative uses on sugar beet and oilseed rape is expected since the Theoretical Maximum Daily Intake (TMDI) using various calculation models was at most 21% of the ADI (0.015 mg/kg bw/d) using the UK model. No acute evaluation was performed as no ARfD was set for propaquizafop. Based on the available supervised residue trials and the proposed residue definition a MRL of 0.05* mg/kg was proposed on sugar beet and rape seed, these MRLs being consistent with the proposals done for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl on these crops. In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment. In soil under aerobic conditions propaquizafop exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolite quizalofop (accounting for up to 88% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, the metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 33% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and the metabolite dihydroxy- quinoxaline accounting for up to 14% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. The metabolite hydroxy-quinoxaline (up to 8.8% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment and exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Another minor non transient metabolite in soil (max. 5.4 - 5.7% AR in three consecutive sampling points) was quizalofop-phenol. Mineralisation of the hydroquinone ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide ranged from 22.6% AR (after 121 days) to 44.2% AR (after 119 days). The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 36 - 39 % AR after 120 - 121 days. Due to the rapid degradation of propaquizafop in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. An adsorption Koc of 2220 mL/g has been estimated for modelling purposes, based on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient Log Kow. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility, and hydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits very low mobility in soil. Based on the adsorption properties of the minor non transient metabolite quizalofop-phenol (slight mobility to immobile) a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite was considered not necessary. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either propaquizafop or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems propaquizafop degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 90 % AR in water and max. 45% AR in the sediment), dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 10% in the sediment) and hydroxy-quizalofop (max. 11.2% AR in the sediment). The estimated rate of degradation in the aquatic system (DT50 (system), DT50 water, DT50 sed) for propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline are not peer reviewed and were not used in the risk assessment. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for hydroxy- quizalofop, dihydroxy- quinoxaline and hydroxy-quinoxaline (Steps 1 and 2) and for propaquizafop and quizalofop (up to Step 3). The initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water (PECsw) and in sediment (PECsed) were used with the appropriate toxicity endpoints for the calculation of the toxicity exposure ratios (TERs). The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by propaquizafop and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and hydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The lower metabolite toxicity endpoints available in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were used in the risk assessments of propaquizafop. The acute and short-term risk to birds was assessed as low for the intended uses at tier one, as was the long-term risk to herbivorous birds. Further refinements were required to address the risk to insectivorous birds. The rapporteur Member State provided a refined risk assessment in an addendum after the expert meeting (Addendum, July 2008), based on yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava) as generic focal species feeding on a mixed small-large arthropod diet. A TER value of 14.8 was calculated using wet weight based proportion of different food types (PD) refinements, indicating a low long-term risk to insectivorous birds from the intended uses. The first tier acute and long-term TERs were above the Annex VI trigger for mammals, indicating a low risk from the intended uses. All TERs for secondary poisoning to birds and mammals were above the Annex VI trigger, indicating a low risk from all intended uses. The acute risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed for the puddle scenario. TERs were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 for both birds and mammals. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from plant metabolites was not addressed in the DAR or during the peer review. Mammal toxicity and metabolism data, however, suggest that the risk to herbivorous mammals was covered by the risk assessment for the parent substance. Propaquizafop was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with fish being the most sensitive species tested. A comparable toxicity was identified for the macrophyte Glyceria fluitans exposed to the metabolite quizalofop. FOCUS Step 3 exposure refinements were required to identify a low risk to aquatic organisms. For use in sugar beet all FOCUS Step 3 scenarios indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms, whereas only 3 out of 5 scenarios for spring use in oilseed rape and 2 out of 6 in winter oilseed rape indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms. The risk to sediment dwellers and the risk from bioaccumulation were assessed as low. The risk to non-target arthropods needed to be refined further to address the in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi. A no-spray buffer zone of 5 m was required to identify a low risk to the non-target plants, based on the most sensitive vegetative vigour endpoint for oat. The risk to bees, earthworms, biological methods for sewage treatment and other soil non-target macro- and micro-organisms was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflumuron Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.194r,"Triflumuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Alsystin SC 480"", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480g/l triflumuron. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition except for air where a data gap has been identified. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurities is missing and the specification can not be finalised. A method for the active substance in the plant protection product has been identified as a data gap. Also some physchem properties have been identified as data gaps. With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential. Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. According to them, three impurities were considered toxicologically relevant, three plant metabolites were considered covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same reference value) but new toxicological data were required for the derivation of the acute reference dose for one acutely toxic plant metabolite. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for the triflumuron, however it was agreed to require further data in order to derive an ARfD for the plant metabolite M07, since this metabolite was shown to be more acutely toxic The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower. The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apples, potatoes and soybean. The study on apples was assessed by the RMS as having several deficiencies, and hence a new fruit metabolism study has been required to support the notified uses in pome fruit and stone fruit crops. The meeting of experts noted deficiencies also in the metabolism studies in potatoes and soybean and agreed that further data is necessary to conclude on a final plant residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring. Though the number and quality of the submitted residue trials was considered sufficient, the conducted trials do not determine all compounds included in the provisionally proposed residue definition for the risk assessment. In addition, further studies on the level of residues in processed fruit commodities are necessary to allow robust estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure to residues present following the use of triflumuron. Consequently, the assessment in terms of potential residues in food of animal origin including a residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in animal products could not be finalised, neither could the consumer exposure and risk assessment be concluded. In addition, the need for further data to derive an ARfD was identified for 4-trifluoromethoxyaniline, a metabolite and degradation product of triflumuron that has been considered pertinent for the consumer risk assessment. At the current stage, with the data available and eligible for evaluation it was only possible to provisionally propose residue definitions and MRLs for the notified uses. However, precise estimates of human and livestock dietary exposure, and finally a robust consumer risk assessment can only be finalised when the outstanding data and information will be evaluated. Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil (DT50 (lab 20 degrees C) = 6.9 - 52 d) under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlrobenzoic acid (M02, max. 23.5 % TRR; DT50(lab) (20 degrees C) = 1.2 - 4.2 d) and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea (M08, TMPU, max. 23.1 % TRR; DT50(lab 20 degrees C) = 1.3 - 20.5 d). Trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring. The range of pH in the soils investigated was too narrow with respect to the directive requirements. Therefore, a new data gap to address the rate of aerobic degradation of parent and formation and degradation rates of metabolites in alkaline soils was identified. From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M2 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil. PEC soil calculations were presented in addendum 2 were accepted by the experts for the parent compound. However, new PEC soil calculations for metabolite M02 and M08 were requested. The new PEC soil have been calculated with the agreed input parameters and EFSA has presented the figures in the list of end points (a mistake was identified in the values calculated in addendum 3). According available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g),metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 280 - 113 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g). However, available data may only be considered relevant for acidic soils. Therefore, the experts identified a data gap for batch adsorption / desorption studies with more alkaline soils for parent and metabolite M02. The PRAPeR meeting of experts noted that these studies would eventually influence the results of PECGW and PECSW calculations and that these calculations may need to be revised. Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the lack of the corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable. In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than of the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values. The meeting agreed that FOCUS PEC (SW / SED) presented in the DAR (including the Step 4 approach based on GIS) were not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. New FOCUS PECSW based on FOCUS kinetics were requested. New calculations provided in addendum 3 are not peer reviewed. EFSA considers that Step 2 calculations for metabolites are adequate for risk assessment. However, Step 3 and Step 4 calculations do not necessary represent worst case estimations. Step 3 single application calculations are still missing for the combination of input parameters agreed by the meeting. Potential ground water contamination was addressed in the DAR by FOCUS PECGW calculations (80th percentile at 1 m depth) for triflumuron and its soil metabolites M02 and M08 with the FOCUS model PEARL and the nine FOCUS GW scenarios. Formation fraction of one had been assumed in these calculations for both soil metabolites M02 and M08. During the peer review data gaps have been identified for triflumuron and the metabolite M02 adsorption / desorption studies on more alkaline soils. Furthermore, rate of formation / degradation on alkaline soils needs to be investigated for triflumuron and both soil metabolites M02 and M08. Therefore, results of the available modelling are only relevant for acidic soils. Under these conditions neither the parent triflumuron nor any of the two soil metabolites M02 and M08 are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g / L. The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 (birds feeding only on large insects) was suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low. Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs > 3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive to exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term studies were conducted with earthworms. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified. No studies with other soil non- target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 2-phenylphenol (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-392) Issued on 19 December 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.217r,"2-Phenylphenol is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on 2-phenylphenol in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 11 February 2008. The peer review was initiated on 17 March 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifiers LANXESS Deutschland GmbH and Dow Benelux BV. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November - December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a post harvest fungicide on citrus and pears (indoor use, closed drench chamber). Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'AGF/1-04', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). A partially validated method is available for citrus but there is currently no validated method for pears. Acceptable methods are available for soil and water but a method for air has been identified as a data gap. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Tested in mammals, 2-phenylphenol showed low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity (oral LD50 2733 mg/kg bw; dermal LD50 > 2000 mg/kg, inhalation LC50 > 0.036 mg/L). 2-Phenylphenol is irritating to skin (R38, ""Irritating to skin"" proposed) and to eyes (R36, ""Irritating to the eyes"" and R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"" proposed) and to respiratory system (R37 ""Irritating to respiratory system""). 2-Phenylphenol is not a sensitising agent. The relevant short-term oral NOAEL is 391 mg/kg bw/day from a study in rats, based on hyperplasia in the bladder urothelium and kidney damage in males. 2-Phenylphenol is not genotoxic. Systemic long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity NOAEL is 39 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased incidences of urinary bladder papillomas, transitional cell carcinomas, and/or combined papillomas and/or transitional cell carcinomas. The mechanism of tumorigenesis in rats was assumed to be non-genotoxic, probably based on chronic irritation of the epithelium by a combination of high pH, high sodium-ion concentration and/or high concentration of free metabolites at high doses. In mice, 2-phenylphenol caused an increased incidence of liver adenoma, carcinoma and hepatoblastoma at 500 mg/kg bw/day and 1000 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for systemic toxicity in mice was <250 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the NOAEL for tumours was 250 mg/kg bw/day. Considering the occurrence of liver tumours in mice and urinary bladder tumours in rats, where the mechanism is not known, R40 Carc. Cat 3 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Reproductive parameters were not affected at any dose level. The overall parental and offspring NOAEL was established at 100 mg/kg bw/day, and the reproductive NOAEL was 500 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental NOAELs in rats were established at 150 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in rabbits the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL were proposed to be 100 mg/kg bw/day and 250 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. 2-Phenylphenol did not show any evidence of neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.4 mg/kg bw/day (NOAEL 39 mg/kg bw/day applying an SF of 100). An Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not allocated, based on the toxicological profile. The default dermal absorption value 100% was regarded as appropriate. Operator and worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As the representative formulation 'AGF/1-04' is used in closed facilities, bystander exposure is not expected. Metabolism of 2-phenylphenol was investigated in oranges and pears having received a post-harvest treatment. In oranges, substantial amounts of residues only penetrated into the peel and, in addition to 2-phenylphenol and its conjugates, 2-phenylhydroquinone and its conjugates were also found. In pears, residues penetrated into the pulp and 2-phenylhydroquinone or its conjugates were not found. Concern was raised with regard to the toxicological potential of the metabolite 2-phenylhydroquinone. Therefore, the experts meeting proposed a provisional residue definition for plant matrices including 2-phenylphenol, 2-phenylhydroquinone and their conjugates, expressed as 2-phenylphenol. It is pending information on the toxicological potential of 2-phenylhydroquinone which was requested from the notifier. The notifier made a case that treated fruits are destined only for direct human consumption and will not be part of livestock diet. Therefore an assessment with regard to livestock exposure and residues in food of animal origin would not be necessary. However, consideration of the issue by risk managers is required. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, an assessment was carried out assuming livestock exposure to 2-phenylphenol residues from treated crops. Intake of fruit pomace is only relevant for ruminants. A metabolism study on ruminants was submitted and showed only very low transfer of residues into milk and tissues. 2-Phenylphenol and metabolites could not be identified in the matrices analysed. Therefore, no residue definition for animal matrices could be proposed. Based on the intake calculation for pomace of citrus fruit treated with 2-phenylphenol according to the notified GAP, no significant residues are expected in milk or tissues of ruminants. However, this estimation might have to be re-addressed for pears when relevant data are available. A provisional MRL for citrus fruit was proposed on the basis of six residue trials on mandarins and oranges respectively. To confirm this MRL the notifier was asked to demonstrate that the analytical methods used in the residue trials and processing studies correctly quantify the residues of 2-phenylphenol, 2-phenylhydroquinone and their conjugates and to provide two further residue trials and valid storage stability data. No MRL could be proposed for pears as no valid residue trials were available. A provisional chronic dietary intake estimate for citrus fruit was carried out by the rapporteur Member State. The TMDI was below the ADI for all considered consumer groups. However, the risk assessment is provisional pending further information on the toxicological potential of the metabolite 2-phenylhydroquinone and on additional residue data for citrus fruit and a full set of residue data for pears. With regard to the applied for representative uses and considering that the waste water, including the cleaning water of the drenching system, must be collected and handled as hazardous chemical waste, the contamination of the environment was deemed to be negligible. However reliable data indicated that 2-phenylphenol is not persistent and exhibits medium mobility in soil (based on short duration batch experiments in which equilibrium was not reached). The formation of unextractable residues in soil was a significant sink, accounting for 77.4% AR, while the mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 9.6% AR after 127 days. No major soil metabolites were found. No reliable natural water sediment study was available, however a range of DT50 values of 5.5 - 19 days was estimated for the dissipation of 2-phenylphenol from the water column. 2-Phenylphenol exhibited a relatively fast photolytic degradation in water to innumerable minor photoproducts and to a diketohydroxy-compound (2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzo[b,d]furan-3,4- dione) as major transformation product (maximum observed 13.6% AR), which also exhibited photolytic degradation. 2-Phenylphenol is readily biodegradable. 2-phenylphenol was toxic to aquatic organisms (the proposal classification was R50 ""Very toxic to aquatic organisms""). Since the exposure of surface water was excluded by the environmental fate and behaviour expert meeting, the risk to aquatic organisms was not assessed. Due to the representative use (indoor), the risk was considered low for terrestrial vertebrates, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro and micro-organisms, other non-target organisms and biological methods for sewage treatment.",NA

The peer review was initiated on 30 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier W. Neudorff GmbH KG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, berry fruits (except strawberry), grapes and ornamentals. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Promanal Neu', an oil in water emulsion (EW). Methods of analysis for food items are currently not required see sections 3. For environmental matrices methods are not required for groundwater and air, for surface water a method is required for alkanes (chain lengths up to C-30). For soil it is not concluded if a method is required or not, see sections 4 and 5. Sufficient internationally accepted methods e.g. ASTM, ISO are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, at this time the technical specification is not accepted and there is no supporting batch data. Data gaps have been identified for autoflammability, flash point and a shelf-life study. During the mammalian toxicology meeting, as no technical specification was agreed by the meeting on physical and chemical properties, concerns were raised over relevant impurities generally associated with these compounds. The specification, as proposed by the notifier, could be accepted on toxicological grounds if its high purity is confirmed by the section on physical and chemical properties. However, while this is not demonstrated, paraffin oils have to be classified as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARfD were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure could be conducted as the experts considered that these specifications were not acceptable from the toxicological point of view. It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacology or oils are used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and, on ingestion, most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces. Paraffin oil has a low toxicity profile. No toxicological study was submitted, except an acute inhalation toxicity study in the rat. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Also, in line with the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be proposed, nor considered necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required. The list of endpoint on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities. No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR. A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised. In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil on the basis of QSAR estimates, and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed, and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C-30 above, the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. EFSA re-calculated the TERs after the expert meeting, with the new PECsw and included the values in the final list of endpoints. A high potential acute and chronic risk was identified for Daphnia magna for all the intended uses. Risk mitigation measures were applied to refine the risk in the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, even using the widest no-spray buffer zones (25m for streams and ditches for the pome fruit and grapevine uses and 30m for stream and ditches for the use on ornamentals), the acute and chronic TERs for Daphnia did not meet the Annex VI trigger values for all the intended uses, except for the acute TERs estimated for the grapevine use when a 25m no-spray buffer zone was applied. Further information is necessary to address the risk to aquatic invertebrates for all of the intended uses. The TERs for fish and alga exceeded the Annex VI trigger value based on the use of a 20m no-spray buffer zone for the pome fruit use. However, the TERs estimated for fish and alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of no-spray buffer zones. The risk for fish and algae was assessed to be low for the grapevine and ornamental uses. However, mitigation measures equivalent to 20m are necessary to refine the risk for fish and alga with respect to the pome fruit use. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed. The experts meeting agreed that, in absence of data, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid exposure to bees. Herbicidal effects of the formulation ""Promanal Neu"" on vegetative vigour were investigated in tests with six plant species. The lowest ER50 value was observed for Allium cepa ER50 > 17.64 kg a.s./ha for vegetative vigour. The TERs were 4.8 and 5.4 for post-emergence treatments based on PECs from spray drift at 3m and 5m no-spray buffer zones, respectively. There was no valid study evaluated in the DAR to assess the effects of paraffin oil on soil non-target macro-organisms. A data gap for information to address this issue was identified. The risk to birds and mammals, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low.",NA

A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as Plant Protection Products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised. In soil under aerobic conditions this paraffin oil mixture exhibits moderate to medium persistence in terms of the time taken for carbon tetrachloride extracted alkanes to be mineralised. The alkanes in the mixture are classed as immobile in soil, on the basis of QSAR estimates and adsorption is not pH dependent. In a 55 cm deep microcosm study this paraffin oil mixture formed a layer at the water surface (spray application made), where it dissipated rapidly exhibiting low persistence in water. Sediment concentrations were not measured. The mechanism of the dissipation was not identified. Surface water exposure assessments are available using the SWASH drift calculator tool. A data gap is identified regarding the potential for water body associated sediment to be exposed and information on degradation/dissipation potential of this paraffin oil mixture in sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by alkanes up to C31 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Based on the available data, paraffin oil was proposed to be classified as toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk of paraffin oil to fish was assessed as low for all the relevant scenarios. Risk mitigation measures equivalent to 25m, 3m and 1m no-spray buffer zones were necessary to refine the risk for aquatic invertebrates and alga for the pome-fruit, grapevines and ornamental uses. The available information did not allow the risk to sediment dwelling organisms to be assessed. Standard laboratory tests were conducted with the formulation 'Para Sommer' and the species Coccinella septempunctata (0 % effects on mortality; 58 % fecundity) and Phytoseidus permisilis on the leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris (69 % of mortality). Two extended laboratory studies with the standard indicator species Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri were submitted. The in-field HQ values were above the Annex VI trigger values, however the off-field HQs were below the triggers. Therefore, the in-field risk should be further addressed and risk mitigation measures should be considered. Data gaps were identified after the peer review by EFSA to address the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms and to soil non-target macro-organisms. The risk to birds and mammals, bees (with mitigation to avoid direct spraying of bees), nontarget plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tebufenpyrad Reissued on 23 October 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.192r,"Tebufenpyrad is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Germany being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tebufenpyrad in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 12 March 2007. The peer review was initiated on 6 February 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant BASF AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June-July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide, insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit for the control of mite pests on all developmental stages of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""BAS 31806I"" (""MASAI""), a wettable powder (WP) containing 200 g/kg tebufenpyrad. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The specification cannot be finalised as there are outstanding issues. Also a shelf-life study and a new suspensibility study have been identified as data gaps. Adequate methods are available to monitor tebufenpyrad residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices. Mammalian toxicology of tebufenpyrad was assessed in a series of tests. Tebufenpyrad is absorbed extensively but slowly. It is widely distributed and has no potential for accumulation. It is excreted slowly but completely and is rapidly and extensively metabolized. It is of moderate toxicity by the oral and the inhalation route and of low toxicity by the dermal route. Tebufenpyrad is neither irritant to skin nor to the eyes but is a skin sensitizer. Based on the available data on acute toxicity a classification as Xn; R20 (""Harmful; Harmful by inhalation""), Xn; R22 (""Harmful; Harmful if swallowed"") and Xi; R43 (""Irritant; May cause sensitization by skin contact"") is proposed. In short term tests with tebufenpyrad effects on bodyweight and food consumption were observed in all species tested (rat, mouse, dog and rabbit). While in rats and mice the liver was the target of toxicity, in dogs gastrointestinal effects and lesions were prevalent. The lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was achieved in the rat (0.7 mg/kg bw/day). In dogs an overall NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day was set. Tebufenpyrad is not genotoxic. A 2-year rat study and an 18-month study with mice were reported. In the rat study a systemic NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on effects on bodyweight and food consumption, altered erythrocyte parameters, and liver effects. The liver adenomas observed were considered not relevant for human risk assessment. In the mouse study a NOAEL of 3.6 mg/kg bw/day was derived based on increased liver and kidney weights, and reduced bodyweight and food consumption. No tumours were observed. Tebufenpyrad did not cause specific effects on reproduction in a two-generation study. While no effects on development were observed in rabbits, in rats increased incidences of supernumerary ribs were seen at maternally toxic doses. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) were set at 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. An acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.02 mg/kg bw was allocated. Using the German model operator exposure amounted to 65% (tractor-mounted application) and to 92% (hand-held application) of the AOEL when personal protective equipment (PPE) was used. In the UK POEM exposure exceeded the AOEL in all scenarios. Worker exposure was calculated to be 57% of the AOEL when PPE is used. A refined exposure assessment after the PRAPeR meeting of experts showed a bystander exposure of 93% of the systemic AOEL. The metabolism of tebufenpyrad in apples was investigated. Application was made at a rate of 2.22 kg a.s./ha which is a 22N rate. Some minor metabolites were identified but given that the study was conducted at such a high rate the only significant residue will be tebufenpyrad. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment is therefore tebufenpyrad only. Sufficient residue trials were supplied for the critical GAP in the north and south of Europe. Residues of tebufenpyrad were stable under freezer storage for a period of at least two years. On processing, the nature of the residue will be unchanged, and sufficient data were supplied to derive processing factors for juice and pomace. Metabolism data in goat and hen were provided; the most significant residues were tebufenpyrad, CL 810,7202 and CL 810,721(3). In a ruminant feeding study, even at 3N, significant residues of tebufenpyrad as well as these two metabolites were not found. Also at the 10N rate, only very low levels were found. The meeting of experts concluded that there will be no significant residues present in products of animal origin. The residue definition was therefore set as tebufenpyrad for monitoring and risk assessment for ruminant only. The meeting noted however, that this should be considered again if other uses lead to higher intakes. No conclusion was reached on the residue definition for poultry. However, the notified uses would not give rise to significant residues in poultry as there is no dietary exposure. The risk assessment showed that maximum intakes are 28 % of the ADI and 64 % of the ARfD. An MRL for pome fruit was set at 0.2 mg/kg. In soil under aerobic conditions tebufenpyrad exhibits moderate to medium persistence forming the major soil metabolite CL 810,721 (accounting for up to 23% of applied radioactivity (AR)), which exhibits low to moderate persistence, and the minor non-transient metabolite CL 810,7284 (accounting for up to 5.1 % AR). Mineralisation of both the benzene- and pyrazole rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 16% AR and 9.2-43.9% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. The formation of unextractable residues accounted for 3.5 % AR and 2.5-35.5% AR, respectively, after 120-122 days. Photolysis studies with tebufenpyrad on soil revealed CL 810,7295 to be the major photo- degradation product accounting for up to 12% AR. Tebufenpyrad is immobile to low mobile in soil; CL 810,721 and CL 810,729 exhibit high to very high mobility in soil, and CL 810,728 is very highly mobile. There was no indication that adsorption of tebufenpyrad, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 were pH-dependent, whilst sorption of CL 810,721 was clearly dependent on pH in soil. In dark natural sediment water systems tebufenpyrad partitioned rapidly from water to sediment, where the metabolite CL 810,721 was formed at maximum 16.5% of AR in the water phase. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for tebufenpyrad up to step 4, step 3 for metabolite CL 810,728 and step 2 for metabolites CL 810,721 and CL 810,729. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by tebufenpyrad and its metabolites CL 810,721, CL 810,728 and CL 810,729 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations, that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute and short-term risk to birds and the acute and long-term risk to mammals were assessed as low in a first-tier risk assessment. The long-term (reproductive) endpoint for birds was discussed by the experts. A long-term NOEL of 6.6 mg a.s./kg bw/day was agreed based on effects on reduced number of hatchlings, eggs laid and 14-day old survivors at the higher tested concentrations. The first-tier long-term TER was below the Annex VI trigger of 5. The refined risk assessment based on the agreed PD (proportion of different food types) resulted still in a TER below 5, and a data gap was identified to further refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds. The risk to earthworm-and fish-eating birds was assessed as low. Tebufenpyrad was very toxic to fish and to aquatic invertebrates with steep dose-response curves. All FOCUS step 4 scenarios resulted in acute TERs > 100 for daphnids, if a no-spray buffer zone of 20m was applied. However, no full FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in TERs above the Annex VI trigger for fish. The risk assessment for fish was refined by HC5 (hazard concentration of the 5th percentile of the species distribution) calculation based on five species. The experts suggested using the lower limit HC5 (95% tile lower confidence limit) of 6.1 mu g a.s./L together with a reduced safety factor of 10. The trigger was exceeded in all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 20m. The long-term risk assessment for invertebrates was based on a population development study with daphnids (NOEC of 4 mu g a.s./L). The Annex VI trigger of 10 was exceeded in the full scenarios D3, D4, R1, R4 and the part scenario D5 (pond), but was below the trigger in the full scenarios R2, R3 and the part scenario D5 (stream), if a 20m no-spray buffer zone was applied. The risk from the major metabolites in water and soil was assessed as low. The maximum bioconcentration factor (BCF) for fish, normalised to the lipid content, was 953. Tebufenpyrad was rapidly metabolised and excreted with a clearance time CT90 of 1.65 days. It is applied only once per year and it dissipates rapidly from the water phase. Therefore it was concluded, that the risk from bioconcentration and bioaccumulation is low. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low. T. pyri was the most sensitive arthropod species tested. A potential for high in-field and off-field risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment. In higher tier (extended laboratory) tests it was shown that the off-field risk to T. pyri is low. Recolonisation of the in-field area was considered as plausible, since effects were <50% after 14 days of ageing of residues. The risk to bees, earthworms, other soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance methomyl,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.222r,"Methomyl is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on methomyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 May 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 28 June 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main applicant DuPont de Nemours. Makhteshim Agan ICC also submitted a dossier which the rapporteur Member State considered to be substantially incomplete. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 7 (J)une 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 23 June 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 83 refers). ollowing the Commission Decision of 19 September 2007 (2007/628/EC)(5) concerning the non inclusion of methomyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier DuPont de Nemours made a resubmission application for the inclusion of methomyl in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows: operator, worker and bystander exposure; the risks to birds, mammals, and aquatic organisms; the possible impact on non-target arthropods. The United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted the additional report on methomyl to the EFSA on 15 May 2008. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA dispatched the additional report to Member States and the notifier for consultation. The comments received were subsequently submitted to the Commission for evaluation. In accordance with Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the Commission subsequently requested the EFSA, by letter received on 22 September 2008, to arrange a peer review of the evaluation, i.e. the additional report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review was initiated on 23 September 2008 by dispatching the comments received on the additional report to the rapporteur Member State for examination. The rapporteur provided a response to the comments in the reporting table, which was subsequently evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues to be further considered in a series of scientific teleconferences with Member State experts in November 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of mammalian toxicology, fate and behaviour, and ecotoxicology. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses presented in the DAR, i.e. use as an insecticide for foliar spraying to control biting and sucking insects in cucumber, courgette, tomato, eggplants and grapes. However, the use on grapes was not supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the additional report, i.e. only those uses on cucumber, courgette, tomato, and eggplants. The risk assessment presented for grapes has not been updated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Lannate 20 SL' (also known as 'Methomyl 20 SL'), a soluble concentrate (SL), registered in some Member States of the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multiresidue method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Methomyl is highly toxic via the oral, ocular and inhalation routes of exposure, but has a low toxicity via the dermal route. On the basis of the data package available the proposed classification is T+, R26 'Very toxic by inhalation' and R25 'Toxic if swallowed'. It is not an eye or skin irritant and does not cause skin sensitisation. The overall short term NOAEL is approximately 10 mg/kg bw/day. Reliable data on effects on cholinesterase activity were not always determined. Based on the available studies, the weight of the evidence indicates that methomyl does not pose a genotoxic, reproductive or developmental concern. There was no evidence of methomylinduced carcinogenic activity in rats or mice. The NOAEL for acute neurotoxicity is 0.25 mg/kg bw. The ADI, AOEL and ARfD were set at 0.0025 mg/kg bw, based on the acute neurotoxicity NOAEL applying a SF of 100. The operator exposure estimate is below the AOEL only for applications in field crops, with the use of PPE. The worker and bystander exposure is estimated to be below the AOEL for all scenarios considered. The metabolism of methomyl in fruits is fully elucidated. Four metabolic pathways were identified generally leading to metabolites of no toxicological concern, as formed as a result of hydrolysis of the carbamate ester link and further degradation. However at least 2 metabolites were identified with intact carbamate structure (INHUZ57 and IN-G6520) and are considered as toxicologically relevant. In fruits, these metabolites are present at much lower levels than the parent compound and their contribution to the global toxicological burden is expected to be minor. Therefore, only the parent compound is proposed to be included in the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in fruit crops. For other commodities dealt with at member state level, the need for inclusion of these metabolites in the residue definition for risk assessment should be carefully considered as it appears that their ratio to the parent compound may be significant on leafy parts of plants, based on information obtained on grape foliage. A sufficient amount of supervised residue trials were conducted in accordance with the supported representative uses, demonstrating that a MRL of 0.5 mg/kg would be needed for table and wine grapes, while residues in fruiting vegetables are consistently below the Limit Of Quantification (0.02 mg/kg) of the analysis method. In processed commodities (grape juice and wine), residues are lower than in raw grapes, this resulting from a preferential transfer to solid fractions during processing and from a partial degradation of methomyl to methomyl oxime. This degradation product has however no toxicological relevance. On the basis of the supported representative uses dealt with under this peer review, no livestock exposure to methomyl residues is expected. Due to the low persistency of methomyl in soil, no residue of methomyl is expected in following crops. Acute and chronic exposure assessments to methomyl residues were performed. A potential acute risk was identified for all considered population subgroups resulting from the consumption of treated table grapes. Degradation of methomyl under dark aerobic conditions in soil does not produce any major metabolite. Taking into consideration also studies performed with thiodicarb (where methomyl appears as metabolite) methomyl is low or moderate persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. Unextractable residues accounted for up to 32.2 % AR after 30 d and CO2 for 75.4 % AR after 92 d. New kinetic analysis presented in the resubmission dossier essentially confirmed the results of the first dossier evaluation. No new soil metabolites were identified in the soil photolysis study. Acetonitrile was detected as the major volatile metabolite. The meeting of MS experts considered that the potential environmental contamination by acetonitrile derived from the use of methomyl will be insignificant with respect to other anthropogenic sources. Under normal environmental conditions microbial degradation in soil is likely to predominate over the photolytic one. In the available field studies for thiodicarb, field degradation half lives of thiodicarb and methomyl were longer than the ones measured under laboratory conditions. The rapporteur Member State normalized the field dissipation rates for methomyl using the average soil temperatures over the period resulting in corrected half lives in the range of those observed in laboratory studies. Since the half life originally used to calculate PEC in soil was derived from a study finally not considered adequate, new PEC soil were calculated and reported in an addendum. Worst case laboratory half life of 15.2 d was used. Two applications of 450 g/ha with an interval of 14 d were calculated as a worst case representative use. Interception of 60 % (corresponding to leaf development BBCH 50) was assumed for vines and 70 % (corresponding to BBCH 20 onwards for tomatoes) was assumed for vegetables. The proposed representative uses in the initial submission did not restrict the application to any particular growing stage, therefore, EFSA calculated peak PEC soil for tomatoes considering leaf development stages (growing stages BBCH 10-19; 50 % interception) in the updated addendum. In the re-submitted dossier the representative uses have been restricted to growing stages after BBCH-20. Methomyl is very highly mobile in soil. A column (3 soils) and an aged column (1 soil) leaching study is available for methomyl. In the column leaching study methomyl in leachate represented 6.6 - 55 % AR. Methomyl oxime was observed up to 2.2 % AR in soil and 1.7 % AR in leachate. In the aged column study, the major radioactive component in the leachate (5 % AR) co-chromatographed with methomyl. Neither hydrolysis nor photolysis are expected to contribute significantly to the degradation of methomyl in the aqueous environment. Methomyl is not ready biodegradable. In water / sediment systems, methomyl partitions to the sediment to levels up to 11.4 % AR after one day. Degradation occurred with half lives between 2.5 to 4.8 days in the whole systems. Dissipation from the water phase was between 3.5 and 4.5 d. New kinetic analysis presented in the resubmission dossier essentially confirmed the results of the first dossier evaluation. Unextractable residues in the sediment reached a maximum of 20.1 % AR after 14 d declining to 14.7 % AR at the end of the study (102 d). CO2 reached a maximum of 32.1 - 72.3 % AR at the end of the studies. Acetonitrile appears as a major metabolite in some systems both in the sediment and as a volatile metabolite. The meeting of MS experts considered that the potential environmental contamination by acetonitrile derived from the use of methomyl will be insignificant with respect to other anthropogenic sources. PECSW / (SED) values for parent methomyl were calculated based only in spray drift loadings and considering two categories. The first category is 'late grapes and listed tall vegetables' (i.e. tomatoes and grapes post-flowering) and the second category is 'listed low vegetables' (i.e. courgettes and aubergines). For cucumber it is necessary for Member States to consider which category cucumbers fit into under their growing regimes. The values were recalculated for a water phase half life of 4.5 d in the addendum. In the resubmission dossier, the applicant presented new PECSW (/ SED) calculations based on FOCUS SW scheme. A soil half life of 6.5 d, a water phase half life of 4.1 d and a sediment phase half life of 1000d were assumed for methomyl in these calculations. Only the representative use on fruiting vegetables was intended to be supported in the resubmitted dossier and therefore PEC calculations for the use in grapes have not been updated. RMS estimated FOCUS Step 4 PECSW / SED with the maximum mitigations possible according final version FOCUS Landscape and mitigation guidance to be used in the EU risk assessment. The potential of ground water contamination by methomyl and its minor soil metabolite methomyl oxime was simulated by the applicant and recalculated by the rapporteur Member State for the representative uses in vines and tomatoes with FOCUS PRZM 2.2.1 and FOCUS PEARL 1.1.1 models for all relevant scenarios. None of the crop / scenario combinations exceeded the 0.1 mu g / L on the 80th percentile annual average concentrations neither for methomyl nor for methomyl oxime. Concentration of methomyl in the air compartment and transport through it is not expected to be significant. Several data gaps were identified during the previous peer review of methomyl for terrestrial vertebrates (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 83, 1-73, Conclusion on the peer review of methomyl): to provide a first -tier risk assessment for birds and mammals (insectivorous) according to SANCO/4145/2000, to refine the acute risk assessment for birds on the same basis as the PPR Panel Opinion on pirimicarb (the EFSA Journal 2005 240,1-21), to refine the long-term risk assessment for birds, to refine the acute and the long-term risk assessment for mammals, to refine risk assessment for birds and mammals from the consumption of contaminated drinking water. In the resubmission dossier the supported use was restricted to cucumber/courgette, tomato/eggplant, 2 applications with an application rate of 250-450 g a.s./ha, BBCH >= 20. A risk assessment was provided accordingly. A refinement of the acute risk to birds on the basis of the PPR Panel Opinion for pirimicarb was conducted. However a conclusion was not reached since experts agreed that further data would be necessary for the interpretation of the results. A refinement of the chronic risk to birds was provided, but a potential high risk could not be excluded when using the relevant generic focal species presented in the revised guidance document on the risk assessment for birds and mammals(6) (i.e. TER=4.0 to 4.6 for the generic focal species of 'finch', 'lark' and 'wagtail). The acute and long term risk for mammals was low for fruiting vegetables due to the limitation of the application window to growing stage BBCH >= 20. The risk from consumption ofcontaminated drinking water was addressed by considering that insectivorous birds obtain the water from the food. However EFSA is of the opinion that the available data do not clearly support this. The risk to aquatic organisms was re-assessed in the resubmission dossier according to FOCUS step 3 and step 4 PEC values for fruiting vegetables with a BBCH >= 20. A high risk was identified in all step 4 scenarios except D6 ditch early use with the application of mitigation measures such as a buffer zone of 30 metres. A high risk to bees was identified. Risk mitigation measures to avoid all contact with bees are considered necessary. No data to establish a withholding period are available. A high risk to non-target arthropods was identified. The applicant was asked to refine the risk assessment for non-target arthropods for both the in-field and off-field areas. In the resubmission no new data were provided. The potential for recovery was not demonstrated by the available data and risk mitigation measures such as an in-field no-spray buffer zone up to 15 m are necessary to address the off-field risk. The acute risk to earthworms is considered to be low. In addition the long term risk to earthworms can be considered to be low for the representative uses in cucumber/courgette and tomato/eggplant for growth stages from BBCH 20 onwards. The risk to soil micro-organisms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance sulfur,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.221r,"Sulfur is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sulfur in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 18 October 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 February 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifiers Sulfur Task Force and Sulfur Working Group. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide on cereals and grapes. Sulfur is also known to have acaricidal properties. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Thiovit Jet 80 WG', 'Microthiol Disperss', 'Kumulus WG', 'Netzschwefel Stulln' and 'Sulphur 80 WG' water dispersible granule formulations (WG) and 'Sulphur Dust' a dustable powder formulation (DP). Monitoring methods are not required; see sections 3, 4 and 5. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Some physical and chemical properties are missing, and some of the sources need 5-batch data. Sulfur is generally regarded as safe for human exposure given the wide range of background exposure, since it is naturally present and abundant in food, where it can be found in the form of sulfate, free amino acids, proteins and vitamins, and it is an essential element needed at a high dose level. Toxicological studies showed that sulfur has a low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity. It is a skin irritant but not an eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. The following classification was proposed: Xi, R38 ""Irritating to the skin"". Sulfur has also a low short-term oral toxicity, since the NOAEL in a 28-day and 90-day rat study was the highest dose level tested (1000 mg/kg bw/day). The weight of evidence indicates that sulfur is not a genotoxic agent. Thus, since sulfur is an essential element, and considering its wide range of background exposure, its low acute and short-term toxicity and its lack of genotoxic potential, long-term toxicity, carcinogenicity- and reproductive toxicity studies were not performed, neither they were required. Likewise, it was agreed not to propose an ADI, AOEL and ARfD. Operator, bystander and worker exposure to sulfur 80% WG products was considered negligible compared to the wide range of background level. Residues do not need to be considered as the mammalian toxicology assessment has concluded that sulfur is of low toxicity, and it is not necessary to set an ADI or ARfD. Therefore, a consumer risk assessment is neither possible nor necessary. Sulfur degradation in soil is governed by oxidation. The available data on the rate of oxidation of sulfur in soil were considered valid by the peer review only from a qualitative point of view. It has been shown that the oxidation rate of sulfur increases with the particle size of the elemental sulfur used, and with temperature. Sulfur exhibits low mobility in soil. A conservative estimation of the Koc value for sulfur was derived from the water solubility value. Results from the available lysimeter study indicated that sulfates (the main oxidation product of sulfur in soil) were highly mobile and prone to leaching under the experimental conditions, whereas the slow release characteristics of elemental sulfur led to smaller leaching losses. An evaluation based on the worst case in terms of sulfur application rate on grapes (30 kg S/ha, 5 times a year, 85 % crop interception), assuming that 100 % of sulfur applied to soil is oxidised to sulfates and 100 % of sulfates will leach to groundwater, showed that there was no unacceptable (< 250 mg/L) contamination of groundwater expected from sulfates. Sulfur is slightly soluble in water. Specific data on behaviour of sulfur in natural aerobic water/sediment systems is not available. However, the peer review considered the available information sufficient to complete an aquatic exposure assessment at EU level for the applied for intended uses. No PECsw values were calculated, as the risk assessment to aquatic organisms was performed taking into account an absence of effects to organisms at the highest water solubility limit of sulfur. New calculations for PECsed were provided by the rapporteur Member State after the PRAPeR meeting; however, as the new calculations were based on inappropriate input parameters, the EFSA identified a data gap to address the exposure assessment for the sediment compartment. The acute and short-term risk to insectivorous birds was low for the representative use in cereals and vineyards at application rates of 2 x 4.8 kg a.s./ha and 8 x 2.56 kg a.s./ha, respectively. The risk to herbivorous birds needs further refinement for the uses in cereals (early application). The risk to insectivorous birds needs to be refined further for the uses in cereals at an application rate of 2 x 6.4 kg a.s./ha, and for the uses in vineyards at application rates of 8, 19.7 and 29.5 kg a.s./ha. The risk to mammals was assessed as low for the uses in cereals and the use in vineyards at an application rate of 8 x 2.56 kg a.s./ha. Further refinement of the risk assessment is needed for application rates in vineyards of 8 x 8, 5 x 19.7 and 5 x 29.5 kg a.s./ha. Some uncertainty remains with regard to the long-term risk to birds and mammals. The experts considered it necessary to address this uncertainty with further and more detailed information/data. The risk to aquatic organisms in the water column was considered in general as low, because the solubility of sulfur in water is very low and no effects were observed at concentrations, which exceeded the water solubility by several orders of magnitude. Uncertainty remains with regard to the risk to sediment-dwelling organisms, and a study with Chironomus riparius was considered necessary. The hazard quotient (HQ) values for bees indicated a low risk to bees for the uses in cereals and in vineyards at an application rate of 2.56 kg a.s./ha. The HQ values exceeded the Annex VI trigger of 50 for all other uses in vineyards. The experts considered the risk to bees likely to be low, because no mortality of bees was observed at the highest tested doses. It was suggested in the meeting that the uncertainty with regard to the risk to bees from application rates of 8, 19.7 and 29.5 kg a.s./ha in vineyards should be addressed further at Member State level, considering also risk mitigation measures. The risk to sensitive non-target arthropods (parasitoids) was not demonstrated to be low in the available risk assessment. Further higher tier testing, e.g. field studies or aged residues tests, are required to provide evidence that recolonisation of the in-field area by sensitive hymenoptera is possible within 1 year. No studies were submitted with activated sewage sludge. It was considered that sulfur would not reach sewage treatment plants in significant amounts, and therefore no studies were considered necessary. The risk to earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target microorganisms, non-target terrestrial plants was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance difenacoum,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.218r,"Difenacoum is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenacoum in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 16 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 3 March 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Sorex Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a rodenticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise manual application into protected bait boxes for rodent control. Full details of the representative use can be found in the attached endpoints. Difenacoum consists of two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. A data gap was set for a new technical specification. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Neosorexa Pellets', a bait (ready-for-use) formulation (RB) containing 0.05 g/kg difenacoum. Analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible, however a data gap was identified for storage stability study. Monitoring methods to determine difenacoum residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin are not required, no MRLs are established. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in soil and water. Adequate methods are available to monitor difenacoum residues in tissues, however a method for the determination of residues of difenacoum in body fluids (blood) was identified as a data gap. With regard to its toxicological properties, difenacoum is a direct anticoagulant that interferes with the blood clotting mechanism by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase. The active substance is well absorbed following oral administration, and widely distributed within the body with the highest concentration in the liver. Based on the results of the acute toxicity studies, the proposed classification was T+ R26/27/28 ""Very toxic by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swallowed"". In repeated dose studies, no other toxic effect than reduced coagulation and haemorrhages were observed, leading to a short-term rat NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day. In the in vitro genotoxicity studies, no gene mutation was induced in bacterial and mammalian cells, while two chromosome aberration tests gave positive results. As the three in vivo genotoxicity studies were negative, the overall conclusion is that difenacoum has no genotoxic potential. No multigeneration study was provided in the dossier. In the developmental studies with rats and rabbits, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, no developmental toxicity was observed at a dose maternally toxic. Foetal effects in rabbits were observed in both the test and control groups, and were concluded as not dose-related. However, the experts considered that difenacoum should be regarded as teratogenic based on the knowledge about analogous compounds (other antivitamin K anticoagulants in humans), and they agreed with the classification proposed by the Specialised Experts on Reproductive Toxicity (Ispra, 19-20 September 2006) i.e. Reprotoxic Category 1, R61 ""May cause harm to the unborn child"". The experts assumed that no contamination of crops would occur during the intended use, and concluded that the derivation of an acceptable daily intake and acute reference dose was not required. For the operator risk assessment, the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.000017 mg/kg bw/day (or 17 ng/kg bw/day), based on the maternal NOAEL in the developmental rabbit study with the use of an overall safety factor of 300. The additional safety factor of 3 was justified by the severity of the toxicological effects of difenacoum, the higher potency of the second generation anticoagulants (such as difenacoum) compared to warfarin, and the much higher vulnerability of human foetuses to vitamin K deficiency compared to rodents. For the operator exposure assessment, the exposure estimates for the biocide use(4) were considered as a worst-case scenario, which gave an exposure of 52% of the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment. No worker or bystander exposure was expected due to the type of product assessed and the representative use in secured bait boxes. Under the conditions of use as applied for (i.e. formulated bait in secure bait boxes), it is very unlikely that residues in food of plant or animal origin will occur. Therefore, it was concluded that the dietary consumer risk is negligible, and that data on the residue behaviour of difenacoum in plants and livestock animals are not required. No MRLs were proposed. However, a situation has not been assessed where bait pellets are removed from bait boxes and hoarded by rodents because of their natural instinct. Depending on the treated area, this may lead to a situation where food or feed could become contaminated or where domestic animals might become exposed. The consumer risk assessment is strictly based on the assumption of a 'no dietary exposure situation' for humans and livestock from the notified representative use, presuming that no contact of difenacoum with food, feed or drinking water will occur. No reliable information is available on the route and rate of degradation of difenacoum in soil, though the information available indicates it has some persistence. The adsorption of difenacoum to soil would be expected to be pH-dependent at environmentally relevant pH, with lower adsorption expected at higher soil pH. Evidence from laboratory sieved soil column leaching studies indicates difenacoum would be expected to exhibit low mobility in soil including alkaline soils, though limitations in the design of experiments in three of the four soils investigated means it is not possible to conclude that difenacoum is immobile. Difenacoum is stable under conditions of sterile aqueous hydrolysis but undergoes rapid aqueous photodegradation. Information is not available on its behaviour in natural aerobic water/sediment systems. Though the available data are relatively limited, the available information is considered sufficient to complete an environmental exposure assessment at EU level for the applied for intended use, but only when formulated bait products are placed in secure bait boxes. When the product is used in this way, the potential for surface water body exposure was assessed as negligible. Also, when the product is used in this way, the potential for groundwater contamination by difenacoum above a toxicologically based concentration limit of 0.05 mu g/L was considered to be low. The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds was assessed as high, if birds can get access to the baits. The acute risk of primary poisoning was assessed as low for larger mammals like dogs or pigs, but a high long-term risk was indicated. Risk mitigation measures are needed, which are proven to be efficient, to prevent birds and larger mammals gaining access to the baits (e.g. bait boxes). The risk to birds and mammals from secondary poisoning was assessed as high. It is more difficult to mitigate the risk from secondary poisoning of birds and mammals. The efficiency and applicability of risk mitigation in the context of the application in the field, such as removal of carcasses during and after the control campaign, is uncertain and would need some further consideration. A high risk was evident for small non-target mammals. No risk mitigation measures were proposed. It is unclear if the risk to small non target mammals can be mitigated without reducing the efficacy of the product. Member States should be aware that it cannot be excluded that the suggested application of difenacoum in the field may also affect endangered/protected small mammal species potentially found in agricultural landscapes. Difenacoum was very toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae. However, the risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low because exposure of the aquatic environment was expected to be negligible from the applied for intended use. The risk to bees, other arthropod species, earthworms, soil macro- and soil micro-organisms, terrestrial plants and biological sewage treatment plants was considered to be low because of negligible or low local point exposure.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance ethanol,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.215r,"Ethanol is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004,(2) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(3) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on ethanol in accordance with the provisions of Article 21(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 7 January 2008. The peer review was initiated on 25 February 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Catalytic Generators UK Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as an ethene precursor, as proposed by the notifier, which comprises of the use of ethanol in a catalytic generator to produce ethene gas, which is used as a growth regulator for the ripening of bananas. Ethanol would not be applied directly to the plants. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Ethy-Gen II', a gas generator (GE) containing 90 % (w/w) ethanol. Considering the applied for use, ethanol cannot be regarded as an active substance, since ethene is in fact the true active substance. A risk assessment for ethene (ethylene) has been presented in a separate DAR. However, the experts on toxicology decided to discuss the substance according to the agenda. No metabolism or toxicity study was submitted to the rapporteur Member State, therefore all the toxicological information came from the open literature, mainly from the US EPA and the IARC review of 1988. The animal data and published information submitted was of insufficient quality to set NOAELs, although these studies had identified target organs and tissues. Considering the representative use, ethanol does not come into contact with food materials being treated and therefore no ADI or ARfD are needed. With regards to the operator exposure risk assessment, the experts concluded that, in view of the low dermal and inhalation exposure (as a worst case, operator exposure would represent the dermal application of 1.08 ml ethanol/day), compared with other sources of general use (as in cosmetics, medicines, household products), there was no concern over the risk assessment to operators. No exposure is foreseen for workers or bystanders related to ethanol and therefore no AOEL was considered necessary. Accordingly, no data gap was set to define NOAELs (either short term, long term, for reproductive toxicity or from further studies) with ethanol. No classification proposal could be concluded based on the available information, but was not required for the risk assessment. A data gap was set on the toxicological information of the reaction product, ethene and other breakdown products, for formal reasons, as in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. This information is needed to conclude on the worker risk assessment (operators and bystanders are not considered to be exposed to ethene and other breakdown products). Another data gap was confirmed for information on the nature and levels of impurities as a result of the catalytic generation. No data or information with regard to residues and consumer exposure were available in the peer review procedure. Under the notified conditions of use the crop will not be exposed to ethanol but to ethene. However ethene and potential other metabolites or reaction products were not subjected to an assessment during the peer review of ethanol. An addendum prepared by the rapporteur Member State on the 'Assessment of available information on the residues of the reaction and degradation products (ethene and ethene oxide)' could not be considered in the meeting of experts due to the restrictions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. Consequently, no discussion or conclusion on the consumer risk assessment and in terms of a MRL proposals were possible. It is proposed by EFSA to set a data gap with regard to the assessment of the relevant information on the residues of the reaction and degradation products of ethanol. The evaluation of the environmental fate and behaviour of ethanol in soil and natural surface water systems is not relevant for the representative use as there will be no exposure to these environmental compartments from ethanol. However, it was recognised that there may be the potential of exposure to two metabolites, or reaction products, of ethanol: ethene and ethene oxide. As these reaction products were not assessed in the DAR for ethanol, but a reference was made to the DAR for ethene, which has not been peer reviewed. A data gap for data and/or information on ethene and ethene oxide was identified. The risk to non-target organisms from the use of ethanol was considered to be minimal due the lack of exposure. The risk from exposure from the two metabolites, or reaction products, ethene and ethene oxide however needs to be assessed. These reaction products were not assessed in the DAR for ethanol, but a reference was made to the DAR for ethylene, which has not been peer reviewed. A data gap to address the potential risk from ethene and ethene oxide was identified during the peer review.",NA

The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Total Fluides. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide for use on pome fruit, stone fruit, citrus and potato. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of endpoints. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were 'Citrole', 'Arb'hiver', 'Arbofine' and 'Finavestan TS', all emulsifiable concentrates (EC). For food and environmental matrices there are data gaps and currently it is not clear whether methods will be required, see sections 2, 3, 4 and 5. Sufficient internationally accepted methods (e.g. ASTM and ISO) are available to characterise the technical material and formulated product. However, numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the technical materials and plant protection products. During the mammalian toxicology meeting, concerns were raised over relevant impurities that require classification of paraffin oils as T ""Toxic"", carcinogenic category 2, R45 ""May cause cancer"". The meeting on toxicology confirmed that the impurities benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons are relevant and the specification as proposed by the notifier could not be accepted on toxicological grounds due to the high levels of relevant impurities. On this basis, no toxicological studies were required, no ADI, AOEL or ARM were proposed and no risk assessment of operator, worker and bystander exposure were conducted. It was noted however that if highly purified paraffin oils were considered (i.e. no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the active substance), then no toxicological concern would be raised for consumers, operators, workers and bystanders. Sources of mineral oil are laxatives in pharmacy or oils used in food technology as release agents, for lubrication purposes, or as a substitute for fat. Paraffin oils are chemically inert substances, especially the straight chain (n) alkanes and on ingestion most of the mineral oil (about 98 % depending on the length of the C-chain) remains unabsorbed and is rapidly excreted, mostly unchanged, via faeces. Acute toxicity studies have confirmed the low toxicity profile of paraffin oils. The experts agreed that no acute, short-term, long-term, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity studies would be required, provided that no concern would be raised from the impurity profile of the substance. Paraffin oils are not considered to be genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or toxic to the reproduction. Considering the low toxicity of paraffin oils (of high purity), no ADI, AOEL or ARfD would be necessary, and no risk assessment for operators, workers and bystanders would be required. The list of endpoints on mammalian toxicology has been filled in considering that the technical material does not contain unacceptable levels of relevant impurities. No information on potential levels of residues in food or feed items were presented in the DAR. A consumer risk assessment has not been performed due to the possible high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. If these compounds are present then it would result in a toxicological classification that would mean that these compounds could not be registered as plant protection products. The risk to consumers can therefore not be finalised. With regard to environmental fate and behaviour, no information was provided in the dossier, nor presented by the RMS in the DAR, except for results from ready biodegradability studies that were carried out using a sewage sludge inoculum. Therefore only crude and incomplete environmental exposure estimates for surface water (only spray drift route of entry assessed) and soil, based on the applied for uses, could be made. With the exception of the requirement for ready biodegradability data, all data requirements remain open. No conclusion on the potential for groundwater exposure can be made using the information in the DAR. The acute TERs estimated for fish and D. magna were above the Annex VI trigger when a non-spray buffer zone of 25 m was applied for the pome fruit uses. However, acute TERs values were above the Annex VI trigger values without the use of any non-spray buffer zone for the other evaluated uses. The acute TERs for alga were above the Annex VI trigger values without risk mitigation for all the evaluated uses. Therefore, risk mitigation measures or refined of aquatic risk assessment were required. The experts at the meeting agreed that in absence of data addressing the risk to bees, mitigation measures should be taken to avoid the application in the presence of bees. Two field studies were conducted with two different plant protection products 'SAM 501' and 'Arbofine'. The intension of the first study was to determine the efficacy of the product 'SAM 501' on red spider mites in apples trees as well as the effects on Amblyseius andersoni in apple tree during summer. The purpose of the second study was to assess the effects on Typhlodromus pyri in apple orchards after the application of 'Arbofine' (1 x 2 hl/ha equivalent to 20.08 Kg a.s./ha). The meeting of the experts had some concern regarding the reliable of the A. andersoni study. The experts also expressed their concern regarding to the second study showed adverse effects on the T. pyri density (at least lasting 43 days) with only one application rate of 20 kg as/ha. The evaluated uses proposed in the GAP included the uses in citrus with 4 x 23.7 kg as/ha. The increase of adverse effects on T pyri populations with repeated application should not be disregarded. The experts agreed that further information to address the risk to non-target arthropods was necessary or mitigation measures should be requested at Member State level. A data gap was identified during the experts meeting for the notifier to address the acute risk to earthworms. There was no valid study to evaluated in the DAR assess the effects of paraffin oils on soil non-target micro-organisms, or soil non-target macro-organisms. Data gaps for information to address these issues are identified. The risk to birds and mammals, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.213,"Etofenprox is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on etofenprox in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005 and following a quality check on the DAR, on 14 February 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Landis Kane Consulting. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in oilseed rape, head cabbage, grapes, peach and apple for the control of biting and sucking insects. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'TREBON 30EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 287.5 g/L etofenprox. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices. In the mammalian metabolism studies, etofenprox was rapidly but partially absorbed after oral administration. It was uniformly distributed through the body, and transferred via placenta and via milk. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation; etofenprox was rapidly eliminated, mainly via faeces, a major part as metabolites. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a modified maximisation test. The main target organs of etofenprox were the liver and thyroid upon short-term or long-term exposure in the rat, which was the most sensitive species. The mouse presented also renal toxicity, but at much higher dose levels and the dog was less sensitive, showing effect only in the liver. The relevant NOAEL for short-term exposure was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat feeding study; for long-term exposure, the NOAELs in rat and mouse were similar. 3 1 mg/kg bw/day in mouse and 3.7 mg/kg bw/day in rat. No potential for genotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The aetiology of the formation of the thyroid adenomas observed in rats was elucidated in a mechanistic study and considered not relevant for human risk assessment. Marginally increased renal cortical tumours found only in male mice at high doses were also not considered relevant to humans. No effect on the reproduction, fertility or development was found, however, considering the increased mortality of offsprings during the lactation phase, classification with R64, ""May cause harm to breastfed babies"", was proposed. Further studies were provided on the plant metabolite alpha-CO2, which showed that its toxicity is covered by the parent's toxicity studies. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of etofenprox was 0.03 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term mouse study and applying a safety factor of 100, which is supported by the long-term rat study. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.06 mg/kg bw/day based on the oral 90-day rat study, applying a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor of 30 % for low oral absorption. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 1.0 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day from the rabbit developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100. A default value of 30 % was agreed for dermal absorption. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation ""TREBON 30EC"", at a maximum dose rate of 0.21 kg etofenprox/ha in high crops (grapes, peaches and apples) was below the AOEL when the use of gloves was considered; in field crops (oilseed rape and head cabbage), no personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed to achieve an operator exposure estimate below the AOEL, according to the German model. According to the UK POEM model, estimated operator exposure was above the AOEL, even when the use of PPE was considered. Estimated exposure of workers entering crops treated with etofenprox was below the AOEL, if PPE were worn (protective gloves, long-sleeved shirt and long trousers). Bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL. Concerning the plant and animal metabolism studies, the meeting of experts discussed the unusual way the experiments were conducted, using applications of a 1:1 mixture of both labelled forms in a single study, instead of two distinct radioactive labels from two separate studies. After discussion, the experts were of the opinion that such studies may only be accepted when no extensive cleavage of the parent molecule is observed. Thus, in the specific case of etofenprox, this practice could be accepted as no extensive metabolism was observed in plants and animals Otherwise, in the case of an extensive metabolism and/or early cleavage of the parent molecule, the recovered levels of the different metabolites may be underestimated, when compared to the initial radioactive level of parent molecule. In such situation, the meeting re-enforced its opinion that metabolism studies must be conducted separately according to the different labelling forms, in order to depict the fate of each labelling portion of the molecule as completely as possible and to provide reliable quantitative information. In plants, the metabolism of etofenprox has been investigated in rapeseed, grape and lettuce. The metabolism was limited and etofenprox was found to be the major compound of the residues, the other metabolites being detected in very low proportions, up to 7% of the TRR for the alpha-CO metabolite. However and considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was observed in proportions higher than 10 % of the etofenprox levels in the supervised residue trials, the meeting of experts decided to define the residue for risk assessment and monitoring as the ""sum of etofenprox and alpha-CO expressed as etofenprox"". Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on rape seed (Northern GAP) and on head cabbage, grape, peach and apple (Southern GAP). The storage stability studies demonstrated that etofenprox and alpha-CO residues were stable under freeze storage conditions for at least two years in oil and water-containing matrices. A standard hydrolytic study was identified as a data gap and additionally, one balance study and three follow-up studies were requested for red wine and for raisin. Processing transfer factors could be calculated for some rape seed, apple and peach processed commodities. For animals, the experts discussed the validity of the metabolism studies performed with the parent etofenprox only. Considering that the alpha-CO metabolite was shown to be a significant constituent of the residues in plants, the experts were of the opinion that information on the fate of this compound in the ruminant metabolism has to be requested. The parent etofenprox was found to be the major residue in all goat and hen matrices, and the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was set provisionally as ""etofenprox"", awaiting the requested information on the alpha-CO metabolite. Based on the cow feeding study and the animal burden calculations, MRLs were proposed for milk and ruminant products. The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments were performed using the EFSA and the UK PSD models. Using the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, the calculated theoretical maximum daily intakes (TMDI) and international estimated short term intakes (IESTI) were shown to be below the ADI and ARfD values. Degradation of etofenprox in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C occurred through oxidation at different parts of the molecule followed by breaking down in smaller moieties (DT50 = 7 - 57.7 days). In one study, one of the metabolites, alpha-CO, was observed to exceed 5 % AR in one of the soils (DT50 = 12 - 45 days). Unextracted radioactivity amounted to a maximum of 55.8 % AR after 55 days, and mineralization (CO2) up to a maximum of 45.6 % AR after 120 days. Under dark anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C, etofenprox is highly persistent in soil (DT50 = 174 days). Under these conditions metabolite 4'-OH3 was identified as a major metabolite. Mineralization was negligible, and unextractable residue in soil amounted to 9.5 % AR after 121 days. Photolysis only slightly enhanced degradation of etofenprox in soil. PEC soil were calculated for etofenprox based on the soil half-life of 25 days for all representative uses. The meeting of experts agreed that these values could be used for the risk assessment. According to the results of available soil batch adsorption/desorption experiments, etofenprox may be classified as immobile in soil (Koc = 8548 - 14923 mL/g). The meeting of experts identified a data gap for an additional batch soil adsorption/desorption study, but considered it not essential to finalize the EU risk assessment. The metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH were estimated to be immobile with PCKOCWIN (EPA). Chemical hydrolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of etofenprox. The photolysis of etofenprox is relatively rapid. The major aqueous photolysis metabolites were alpha-CO (max 63.6 %) and PENA(4) (max. 14.4 %). The metabolite alpha-CO was also found to reach up to 10% of the parent's applied amount in the outdoor mesocosm study. On the basis of the available studies, etofenprox should be considered not ready biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, partition of etofenprox to the sediment occurs during the first seven days. The meeting of experts agreed on the half-lives calculated for etofenprox in the whole system (DT50 whole system = 6.5 days - 20.1 days). The metabolite 4'-OH was identified as a major metabolite in the sediment phase of both systems. The meeting of experts discussed the need to consider aqueous photolysis and photolysis metabolites for the EU risk assessment, and agreed that the risk assessment presented for the metabolite alpha-CO by the applicant could be regarded as conservative. PECSW were calculated with FOCUS SW modelling for the relevant scenarios based on the soil halflife of 25 days. Degradation in the water phase was assumed to occur with a half-life of 1000 days, and the mean whole water/sediment system half-life was applied to the sediment phase. Step 3 and Step 4 (only oilseed rape; assuming 30m spray drift buffer zone) were calculated for the representative uses. PECSW of the aqueous photolysis metabolite alpha-CO was estimated to be 63.6 % of the PECsw of the parent compound. Worst case PECsw were also estimated for the sediment metabolite 4'-OH as 21.9 % of the PECsw calculated for the parent compound. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate PECSED for the parent compound for the uses different from oilseed rape, to take into account the accumulation of etofenprox after multiple applications and the PECSED of the metabolites alpha-CO and 4'-OH. The necessary PECSW / SED values were provided by the rapporteur Member State in the addendum Volume 3 v3 after the meeting of experts. Neither etofenprox nor its soil metabolite alpha-CO is expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g /L for any of the representative uses and scenarios simulated. The environmental concentrations in air and transport through air of etofenrprox are considered negligible. The risk assessment indicated low risk to birds and mammals for all intended uses. Refinements of the long-term risk assessment for mammals were, however, required for the uses in head cabbage, grape, peach and apple to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low for all of the intended uses, as was the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended use in oilseed rape. Further refinements were still required to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals for the intended uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. The acute risk to birds and mammals from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddles was assessed as low for all intended uses of etofenprox. Etofenprox was not considered to biomagnify in the terrestrial food chain, and the risk from plant metabolites was assessed to be low. The risk to aquatic organisms was not addressed for any of the intended uses. The TER values for aquatic organisms, based on tier 1 effect data and FOCUS Step 3 and 4, failed to meet the Annex VI trigger value. The use of an endpoint from the available higher tier mesocosm study would require further supportive data. Member State experts suggested that single species tests on the most sensitive species from the mesocosm study should be provided to consolidate the confidence in the data from the mesocosm. The design of the single species tests should take into account the multi-application uses. Based on the additional studies, a relevant assessment factor should be reconsidered for a refined aquatic risk assessment. A fish full life cycle (FFLC) study was required by the Member State experts, which should be included in the aquatic risk assessment. The risk to sediment dwellers should be addressed for etofenprox and for the metabolites 4'-OH and alpha-CO. Also, the aquatic risk assessment for alpha-CO would have to be refined further for uses in head cabbage, grapevine, peach and apple. In addition, the risk from biomagnification and potential endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms should be addressed. Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated a high risk to bees from all intended uses. Member State experts concluded that the available field studies did not address the risk to bees, and they agreed that mitigation measures were needed for pre-flowering/flowering uses in oilseed rape, grapevine and apple to avoid exposure of bees. The Tier I risk assessment indicated a high in-field risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi and Typhlodromus pyri for all intended uses. The off-field risk was considered to be low for A. pyri and A. rhopalosiphi for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, based on no-spray buffer zone of 1 and 5m, respectively. Higher tier risk assessment based on extended laboratory studies with A. rhopalosiphi, T pyri, Orius laevigatues and Chrysoperla carnea still indicated a high in-field risk to non-target arthropods. The potential for in-field recovery was not addressed in the draft assessment report. The higher tier off-field risk assessment indicated a low risk to non-target arthropods for uses in oilseed rape and head cabbage, with no-spray buffer zones of 1 and 5m, respectively. For uses in grapevine, the assessment indicated a need for a no-spray buffer zone of 10m to identify a low risk. Further refinements were required to address the off-field risk to non-target arthropods for uses in peach and apple. The risk to earthworms, non-target micro- and macro-soil organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low for all intended uses.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance incorrectly named didecyldimethylammonium chlorides,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.214r,"Didecyldimethylammonium chloride is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20042 , as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/20073 . This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on didecyldimethylammonium chloride in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 28 November 2007. The peer review was initiated on 23 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation to the Member States and on 5 March 2008 to the sole notifier Lonza GmbH. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November-December 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The active substance called didecyldimethylammonium chloride is a mixture of compounds and has no ISO common name. However, to facilitate the peer review, the name didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) was used. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as bactericide, fungicide, herbicide and algicide, as proposed by the notifier, which comprise soaking or dipping applications for the disinfection of horticultural vessels and equipment, and watering applications for the disinfection of surfaces, controlling plant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, weed seeds and algae. Full details of the GAP can be found in the endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was M&ENNO-TER forte, a soluble liquid (SL) containing 310 g/L didecyldimethylammonium chloride. Data gaps were identified for adequate information on identity, production process, starting materials, purity and how to express it, specification, analytical methods and test materials used in toxicity testing. Data gaps were identified for an analytical method for the determination of the active substance in the technical material and formulation, and also for monitoring of DDAC residues in surface water. Sufficient methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties, except for the active substance content, are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Considering the proposed uses, residues in food of plant and animal origin, soil, ground water and air are not relevant, and therefore analytical methods for these matrices are not required. With regard to its toxicological properties, DDAC was absorbed to a very limited extent after oral administration, without accumulation in the organism. Based on acute toxicity results, the proposed classification Xn; R22 Harmful if swallowed and C; R34 Causes burns was agreed for DDAC. In repeated dose studies, even though the systemic effects were considered as secondary to the primary effect of corrosivity, they were taken into account for the setting of the NOAELs. Therefore, the agreed oral short-term NOAEL was 60.7 mg DDAC/kg bw/day in rats, and 10 mg DDAC/kg bw/day in dogs. Similarly, in the dermal study, only local effects in the skin were observed and lead to a dermal short term LOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day (lowest dose tested). DDAC did not show genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. The agreed long-term NOAEL was 32 mg DDAC/kg bw/day in rats based on decreased bodyweight gain and histopathology in the liver and lymph nodes, and 76.3 mg DDAC/kg bw/day in mice based on reduced bodyweight gain. In the reproductive toxicity studies, neither adverse effects on the reproductive parameters, nor any indication of teratogenic properties were observed. In the multigeneration study, the agreed parental and offspring NOAEL was 50 mg DDAC/kg bw/day. In the developmental studies, clinical signs indicative of primary local effects (attributed to the corrosive properties of DDAC) were taken into account for the derivation of an agreed maternal NOAEL of 1 mg DDAC/kg bw/day in rats and rabbits. Foetal effects (if any) were only observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. With regard to the setting of the reference values, considering the restricted representative use in floriculture, the experts agreed that no dietary exposure of the consumers was expected, and therefore no acceptable daily intake (ADI) or acute reference dose (ARfD) were needed. The derivation of the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was extensively discussed by the experts, who agreed that, according to the toxicological profile of DDAC, an AOEL had not to be set. Concerning the operators, it was assumed that the exposure was safe with the use of personal protective equipment (due to the corrosive properties of DDAC). The exposure of bystanders was excluded due to the use indoors or in greenhouses. The worker exposure was expected to be negligible. No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of didecyldimethylammonium chloride in plants and livestock animals in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of didecyldimethylammonium chloride as a disinfectant of surfaces, plant pots and equipment only used for ornamental plant production is normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to humans or livestock animals. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to didecyldimethylammonium chloride residues, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the notified representative uses. With regard to the applied for representative uses, the contamination of the soil compartment or the groundwater was deemed to be negligible. However, reliable soil batch adsorption data were available indicating that didecyldimethylammonium chloride is immobile. No reliable natural water sediment study was available, however, a data gap was not considered necessary by the peer review, as the risk from the metabolites that may be formed was deemed to be covered by the risk assessment of the parent compound. As the FOCUS approach could not be applied to the representative uses of DDAC, the predicted environmental concentrations in surface water and sediment were estimated using USES 2.0 model, which can estimate the exposure via the sewage systems including a sewage treatment plant. For the calculations it was assumed that a user applies not more than 20 kg (for tier 1 calculation) or 5 kg (for tier 2 calculation) of DDAC on one occasion. Moreover, as an exposure refinement, it was assumed that a certain amount of DDAC is retained in the sewage system by adsorption to the organic matter. The values from these calculations are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion, which might not cover a wide range of situations in all Member States. DDCA was toxic to aquatic organisms (N Dangerous for the environment, R50/R53 very toxic to aquatic organisms; may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment). A high risk was identified for invertebrates and algae, even considering the surface water exposure reduction, which can occur as a consequence of the adsorption of the active substance to the organic matter in the sewage system. Therefore, a data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic organisms. The risk was assessed as low for terrestrial vertebrates, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro and microorganisms, other non-target organisms and biological methods for sewage treatment.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflusulfuron (considered variant triflusulfuron-methyl),2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.195r,"Triflusulfuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflusulfuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 26 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 31 August 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Du Pont de Nemours. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide on sugar and fodder beet for the control of annual grasses and broad-leaved weeds as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Triflusulfuron-methyl 50WG', a water dispersible granule (WG) containing 500 g/kg of triflusulfuron-methyl. Since clarification is required with respect to the proposed maximum levels of certain impurities in the technical material, the specification as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional (September 2008). Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product is possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds in the respective residue definitions for monitoring food/feed of plant origin, soil surface water and air, however an analytical method is needed for monitoring metabolites in groundwater. As for mammalian toxicology, triflusulfuron-methyl has low acute toxicity via the oral, dermal, or inhalation routes; it is not an eye or skin irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose studies triflusulfuron-methyl caused decreased body weight gain, food intake and food efficiency, as well as increased liver enzymes and anaemia. The relevant short and long-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 6.6 mg/kg bw/day and 4.06 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The weight of evidence from the complete battery of genetic toxicology studies indicates that triflusulfuron-methyl does not have genotoxic potential. In carcinogenicity tests male rats showed increased incidence of Leydig cell adenomas likely due to an aromatase inhibition mechanism, therefore the compound was proposed for classification as a category 3 carcinogen (Xn, R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect""). The increase in hepatocellular adenoma in male mice was considered not relevant to human risk assessment. Triflusulfuron-methyl is not a reproductive toxicant: the reproductive NOAEL is >= 89.5 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the maternal and offspring NOAEL is 5.8 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight in parental rats and pups. In developmental toxicity studies in rats, both the maternal and foetal NOAELs are 120 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, triflusulfuron-methyl did not show any teratogenic potential, with the developmental NOAEL >= 800 mg/kg bw/day and the maternal NOAEL of 15 mg/kg bw/day. Triflusulfuron-methyl did not show any neurotoxic potential. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.04 mg/kg bw/day (the ADI is based on the NOAEL from the 2-year study in rats with a Safety Factor (SF) of 100; the AOEL is based on the NOAEL from the 90-day study in rats, SF 100 and oral absorption 65%). The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 1.2 mg/kg bw based on the NOAEL for maternal body weight loss in the rat developmental study and a SF of 100. The estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL. Metabolism of triflusulfuron-methyl in primary crops was investigated in a sugar beet metabolism study, the results of which showed the only relevant residues at harvest are the metabolites IN-M7222(2) and IN-E7710(3). Triflusulfuron-methyl had decreased to <0.01 mg/kg by day 14. The residue definition for risk assessment was therefore set as IN-M7222 and IN-E7710. The residue definition for monitoring is IN-M7222. A confined rotational crop study was conducted, which showed that the only significant residues were the same as those seen in primary crops and this was confirmed by a radiolabelled field study. It was considered by the meeting of experts that the cold rotational crop study was not sufficient to fully quantify residues in rotational crops and a data gap was identified. Sufficient residues data were available for the representative crop sugar beet and it was demonstrated that residues are stable under freezer storage for a period of 12 months. Processing studies are not required as residues are low. In goat metabolism studies conducted at circa 1 and 100 N, four significant metabolites were identified. From this data the meeting of experts appeared to conclude that the residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment should be IN-M7222. However, there is no justification for this in the report of the meeting. The risk assessment can not be conducted as there are no applicable toxicological endpoints available. Triflursulfuron-methyl exhibits low to moderate persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT (50 lab aerobic) = 5.3 - 15 d). Triflursulfuron-methyl degrades by cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge and subsequent cyclisation to yield the two major metabolites methyl saccharin (IN-W6725(4); DT50 = 13 - 403 d) and triazine amine (IN-D8526(5); DT50 = 74 664 d). Triazine amine is subsequently demethylated to N-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-E7710; DT50 = 30 393 d) and N,N-bis-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-M7222; DT50 = 80 486 d). Unextractable radioactivity reached a maximum of 65 % AR after 368 d with triazine labelled compound and a maximum of 48.8 % AR after 90 d with ester carbonyl labelled compound. Mineralization was negligible for the triazine moiety and significant for the ester carbonyl moiety. The meeting of experts agreed that dark aerobic degradation in soil of the metabolites triazine amine (IN-D8526) and N,N-bis-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-M7222) show pH dependence. Under dark anaerobic conditions, degradation of triflusulfuron-methyl (DT50 anaerobic = 21 d) yields the metabolites methyl saccharin and triazine amine at levels above 10 % AR. The meeting of experts considered that overall, photolysis will not represent a significant role in the degradation of triflusulfuron-methyl in soil. Two field studies are available, which were carried out in Northern EU (Colonne and Munich, DE). The aerobic soil metabolites identified in the laboratory studies were also found in the field studies at comparable amounts. PECsoil were calculated for triflusulfuron-methyl and all major aerobic soil metabolites by the rapporteur Member State, based on worst case laboratory DT50 values and the maximum levels formed in the laboratory soil studies, as updated in corrigendum 1. From the available studies, triflusulfuron-methyl may be considered to exhibit high to very high mobility (K-foc, = 25 - 52 mL/g); triazine amine (IN-D8526) medium to high mobility (K-foc, = 70 - 374 mL/g); N-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-E7710) medium to very high mobility (K-foc = 41 - 181 mL/g); N,N-bis-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-M7222) high to very high mobility (K-foc = 31 - 127 mL/g) and methyl saccharin (IN-W6725) very high mobility (K-foc = 6 - 22 mL/g). Hydrolysis half-lives for triflusulfuron-methyl were DT50 = 3.7 d (pH 5), DT50 = 32 d (pH 7) and DT50 = 36 d (pH 9). The meeting of experts confirmed that photodegradation of triflusulfuron-methyl is not expected to play a significant role in the aquatic environment. Triflusulfuron-methyl is not readily biodegradable according the available study. In water / sediment aquatic systems, triflusulfuron-methyl partitions to the sediment (max. 22 % AR) and degrades (DT50 whole system = 21 39 d) to methyl saccharin (IN-W6725; max. 38.4 % AR in water and 12 % AR in sediment after 100 d) and triazine-amine (IN-D8526; max. 23.2 % AR in water and 18.9 % AR sediment after 61 d) that subsequently degrades to N-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-E7710; max. 10.7 % AR in water after 61 d). By an alternative pathway, triflusulfuron is formed (JK-555(6); max. 28.6 % AR in water after 100 d and 19.7 % AR in sediment after 61 d). The meeting of experts agreed that a water sediment study with pH within the acidic range (pH 5 - 6.5) would be needed but this was considered to be not essential to finalise the risk assessment at the EU level. The rapporteur Member State produced new PECSW using FOCUS up to step 3 for the parent triflusulfuron-methyl and up to step 2 for the metabolites that were agreed by the meeting of experts for the EU risk assessment. Potential ground water contamination was addressed by FOCUS GW modelling The meeting of experts agreed on the modelling performed by the rapporteur Member State and summarized in corrigendum 1. Effect of soil pH was considered in the calculations performed by the rapporteur Member State. For the representative use of triflusulfuron-methyl in sugar beet every three years, triflusulfuron-methyl did not exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for any of the scenarios irrespective of the pH. The metabolites triazine amine (IN-D8526) and N-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-E7710) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for one of the six scenarios modelled (Piacenza) under acidic soil conditions. The metabolite N,N-bis-desmethyl triazine amine (IN-M7222) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in the six scenarios simulated under acidic soils and in the five scenarios under alkaline soils. Additionally, the trigger of 0.75 mu g/L was exceeded for metabolite IN-M7222 in four of the five scenarios with alkaline soils. Degradation of the metabolite methyl saccharin (IN-W6725) is not pH dependent and PECGW were calculated in a separate simulation. The metabolite methyl saccharin (IN-W6725) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in all nine FOCUS GW scenarios and exceeded the trigger of 0.75 mu g/L in eight of the scenarios. Triflusulfuron-methyl is not expected to volatilize or be prone to long-range transport in the atmosphere. Triflusulfuron-methyl is very toxic to algae and higher aquatic plants. The TERs were >10 in two full FOCUS step 3 scenarios (D3, D4) and in the part scenario R1 (pond). The TERs were below the trigger in scenario R3 and the part scenario R1 (stream). Risk mitigation measures and/or a refined aquatic risk assessment is needed in Member States where environmental conditions prevail which are represented by FOCUS scenarios R1 (stream) and R3 (stream). Non-target plants were more sensitive when technical triflusulfuron-methyl was applied together with the surfactant X-77. The lower endpoints observed for technical triflusulfuron-methyl plus X-77 were considered as not being of relevance for the applied for representative use of the formulation 'Triflusulfuron-methyl 50WG'. The increased toxicity of technical triflusulfuron-methyl when combined with a surfactant should considered by Member States in their national registration, if appropriate. The TERs were 9.4 and 21.5 for the endpoints derived for the formulation with and without surfactant, indicating a low risk to non-target plants in the off-field area. The risk to birds and mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, soil macro- and soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA

Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June July 2008.

The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Atonik', a soluble concentrate (SL) containing 1 g/1 sodium 5-nitroguaiacolate 2 g/1 sodium o-nitrophenolate and 3 g/1 sodium p-nitrophenolate. The specifications for the technical materials currently should be regarded as provisional (September 2008). Analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product is possible; however a data gap was identified for additional validation data for determination of relevant impurities in the technical materials. Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices. With regard to its toxicological properties, the mixture 'Atonik' was shown to be rapidly and extensively absorbed, widely distributed in the body without bioaccumulation and excreted mainly via urine. The proposed classification for the acute toxicity was Xn; R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" for the three active substances; Xi; R36 ""Irritating to eyes"" for sodium o-nitrophenolate (Na o-NP) and sodium p-nitrophenolate (Na p-NP); and Xi; R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"" for sodium 5-nitroguaiacolate (Na 5-NG). In the short-term studies, the most sensitive species was the dog, with the lungs, liver and kidney as target organs at higher doses. However the NOAEL was based on clinical findings at lower doses (soft/mucous faeces and vomiting). Even though some positive results were observed during the in vitro genotoxicity studies, the negative results in the in vivo testing were supported by the absence of a carcinogenic potential in the long-term studies. With regard to reproductive toxicity testing, the fertility index was decreased in the presence of maternal toxicity at the high dose level, but no adverse effect was noted in the offspring. No teratogenic effect was observed in developmental studies with rats and rabbits. There were some indications of foetotoxicity in rabbits, but they were attributed to maternal toxicity. In the rabbit study, no maternal NOAEL could be derived since clinical signs were observed in dams at all dose levels. For the derivation of the reference values, it was agreed to set values applicable separately to the three active substances. Additionally, it was decided to use the toxicological studies with the mixture 'Atonik' since they are providing lower NOAELs for the active substances (based on their ratio in the mixture) than the studies with the individual active substances. Consequently the agreed values were based on the lowest individual NOAEL value in the relevant study with the mixture, applicable to the three active substances as a conservative and pragmatic approach. Therefore the agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.003 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1 -year dog study with the use of a safety factor of 100 Similarly, the agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.007 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day dog study and using a safety factor of 100. The agreed acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw based on the developmental study with rabbit, and applying an increased safety factor of 300 due to the use of a LOAEL (maternal) instead of a NOAEL. In the absence of experimental results, the agreed dermal absorption value of 100% was adopted. The sum of the operator exposure estimates for the three active substances give a total exposure level below the AOEL when PPE is used during field application with tractor or greenhouse use, but the exposure is above the AOEL even with PPE in the case of hand-held application in field. The use of PPE is also required for workers re-entering treated fields, but the exposure level of bystander is below the AOEL. Plant metabolism studies have been performed on sugar beet, tomato and rapeseed after foliar applications of 14C-'Atonik', a mixture of the three active substances Na 5-NG, Na o-NP and Na p-NP, using exaggerated application rates up to 10 times the total normal dose rate. At harvest the TRR was low in beet roots, tomato fruits and rape seeds, in the range of 0.034 to 0.049 mg/kg and no parent active substances or unidentified metabolites were observed at levels higher than 0.013 mg/kg. However in beetroot leaves, it was considered that the two unknown metabolites M6 and M7 could be above 0.01 mg/kg when 'Atonik' is applied at a normal dose rate and additional information was requested on the possible structure of these two compounds. Three separate residue definitions were proposed in the DAR for each individual compound as ""Na 5-NG"", ""Na o-NP"" and ""Na p-NP"" respectively. Nevertheless, after the meeting and taking into account the conclusion of the PRAPeR 54 meeting on mammalian toxicology setting the same ADI and ARfD values for the three constituent active substances, the EFSA was of the opinion that it could be possible to propose a single residue definition for monitoring as ""sum of 5-NG, o-NP and p-NP"", this proposal having to be considered as not peer reviewed. No supervised residue trials were presented and the meeting of experts, considering low application rates and the metabolism study results, agreed that such trials are not necessary and confirmed the MRL values set at the LOQ. Processing studies and animal metabolism studies were not provided since significant residues of Na 5-NG, Na o-NP and Na p-NP are not expected in plant commodities. No rotational crop studies were submitted with regard to the low DT50 values. The MRLs of 0.01* mg/kg were initially proposed in the DAR for each of the individual active substances. Nevertheless and based on the single residue definition, the EFSA is of the opinion that MRLs of 0.03* mg/kg (sum of the LOQ achieved for each individual active substance) should be more appropriate. The chronic and acute consumer risk assessments showed that the TMDI and IESTI did not exceed the ADI and the ARfD respectively. In soil under aerobic conditions Na 5-NG, Na o-NP and Na p-NP exhibit very low to low persistence forming the unknown major soil metabolite M5 (accounting for a maximum of 20.5% of applied radioactivity (AR)). Mineralisation to carbon dioxide was significant, accounting for 54.9-60.8% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink accounting for 32.1% to 41.1% of the applied radioactivity after 120 days. Na 5-NG exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, whereas Na o-NP and Na p-NP exhibit high to low mobility in soil. There was no evidence of a correlation of adsorption with any soil parameter. In dark natural sediment water systems, Na 5-NG, Na o-NP and Na p-NP degraded exhibiting fast disappearance from the water column and from the whole system. The terminal metabolite, carbon dioxide, accounted for 66.1-63.5% AR at 122 days (end of study). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 30.7%-34.6% AR at study end. Major metabolites were not found in this study, however in the aqueous photolysis study several unknown metabolites were observed. Risk assessment for these photolytic metabolites was required by the peer review. FOCUS surface water modelling was carried out up to step 2 for the individual active substances. These values form the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses of these active substances to exceed the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However, based on a worst case calculation for the unknown metabolite M5, in geoclimatic regions represented by the Jokionen FOCUS groundwater scenario, contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 itg/L limit cannot be excluded for application to sugar beet. Therefore the identification of this unknown metabolite M5 and ground water modelling with a second model were required by the peer review. A low acute, short-term and long-term risk was assessed for terrestrial vertebrates in a first-tier assessment for the representative uses. Na 5-NG, Na o-NP and Na p-NP were toxic to aquatic organisms (N ""Dangerous for the environment"", R51/R53 ""Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment""). Algae were the most sensitive organisms tested. As these active substances are ""plant growth regulators"" the meeting agreed to require further studies such as a second algae species and Lemna tests. On the basis of available data, a low first-tier risk was identified for aquatic organisms. According to the fate meeting conclusion, a data gap was identified to further address the risk to aquatic organisms from the photolytic metabolites. The risk was assessed as low for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro and microorganisms and other non-target organisms. No risk was expected to biological methods for sewage treatment, but the experts agreed that at member state level the effects should be addressed in case agricultural practices induce a possible concern to sewage treatment plants.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bifenthrin,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.186r,"Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 01 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12. May 2006 to the sole applicant, FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Talstar 8 Sc"", a suspension concentrate(SC) containing 80 g/1 bifenthrin. Since clarification is required with respect to the proposed maximum levels of certain impurities in the technical material, the specification as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however data gaps were identified for residue methods in food/feed of animal origin air and body fluids and tissues. As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is ""Toxic if swallowed"" (R 25), it is toxic by inhalation (R 23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant. The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice, as their relevance to humans could not be excluded and since the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed. In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL>7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog studz with an SF 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL. In metabolism studies on apples, cotton seed and corn plants bifenthrin was found to be the predominant residue. No significant cis-trans-isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. Only for wheat/triticale and rye grown in Northern Europe sufficient residue trials have been submitted. Additional residue trial data are required to cover the notified use on n cereals in Northern and Southern Europe. On the basis of the available trials in cereals MRLs were only provisionally proposed. The representative uses in pome fruit and grapes are currently not supported by residue trials carried out according to the notified cGAP. For the use on cereals no processing studies are required. The requirement of such studies for the uses on pome fruit and grapes has to be evaluated once sufficient data on residue trails are available. Metabolism studies on rotational crops show that no significant residues are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption after application of bifenthrin on cereals according to the notified GAP. Metabolism studies on lactating goats and laying hens show that metabolism, mainly by oxidation, cleavage of the ester binding and conjugation, is more extensive in some of the compartments. The experts meeting decided to include metabolites in the provisional residue definition for risk assessment for liver and kidney and eggs respectively. On the basis of provisional dietary burden calculations for intake of cereal and straw only, significant up-take of residues is only expected for cattle. Taking into account the intake of cereals and of animal products only, consumer exposure is expected to be below the toxicological reference values. However, this risk assessment is only indicative and pending additional data for diverse areas of the residue section. In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid(2) (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate persistence and the minor non transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin(3) (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there is a data gap identified to confirm this and a data gap is identified for soil mobility data on TFP acid. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent. TFP acid might be expected to exhibit pH dependent adsorption. In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for intended uses on cereals. For the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 sediment calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. A data gap was identified for PEC in surface water for the major soil metabolite TFP acid that may runoff or drain to surface water. There is also a data gap identified for a further runoff mitigation assessment with respect to bifenthrin in the FOCUS runoff scenarios. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses on cereals by bifenthrin and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However for the metabolite TFP acid, data gaps are identified for the information required to further assess groundwater exposure potential. Contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit by TFP acid might be expected in at least some, if not all FOCUS groundwater scenarios if all the necessary data to complete exposure simulations were available. Thus it is expected that a non relevance assessment will be necessary for TFP acid. Such an assessment that could be considered by the peer review is not available. Satisfactory environmental exposure assessments are not available for the applied for intended uses on grapes and pome fruit. A low risk was indicated in the first-tier risks assessment for birds and mammals for all the evaluated uses except for the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and for the acute risk to mammals in orchards. A potential high long-term risk from the exposure of bifenthrin to mammals was identified for all the intended uses. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the long-term risk for mammals for all the intended uses. A new data gap was identified after the PRAPeR meeting by EFSA, for the applicant to refine the long-term risk to insectivorous birds and the acute risk to mammals in orchards. The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds was considered to be low in cereals. A potential risk was identified for earthworm-eating mammals in cereals and a refinement of the risk was required. The risk assessment for fish eating birds and mammals should be re-estimated when the revised BCF would become available. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was however considered to be low. The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m non-spray buffer zone) were below the Annex VI trigger values. Two higher tier studies were available to refine the assessment for invertebrates. From the mesocosm study a NOAEC of 0.015 mu g a.s./L was derived. It was proposed to apply an assessment factor of 3 to this value to cover variation in potential for recovery depending on the nature of the ecosystem. The higher tier risk assessment resulted in a TERit=3 based on the NOAEC from the mesocosm and initial FOCUS PECaw, Step 4 with 20 m no spray buffer zones in cereals. No safe use was identified for fish when applying the maximum 25m no spray-buffer zone. Due to the logP(OW) of 7.3 for bifenthrin the potential to bioconcentrate was considered to be high. The experts agreed that the potential for bifenthrin to accumulate in aquatic organisms needs to be further addressed. Two data gaps were identified during the experts meeting, The first one was for the submission of a refined risk assessment for fish and the second for the submission of the ecotoxicological studies with the TFP acid since there is the potential for exposure to this metabolite in water bodies associated with treated crops. The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the evaluated uses. Risk mitigation measures were identified as being necessary. It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods (NTA) for in-field and off-filed areas within the treated area from the use in cereals. Risk mitigation measures are required to refine the risk to NTA in the off-field areas. A non-spray buffer zone of 5 m was identified as being necessary for cereals. A data gap was identified for the applicant to refine the risk to non-target arthropods. The acute risk assessment of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low in cereals. However, the long-term risk to earthworms in cereals from exposure to both these compounds was considered to be potential high, and needed to be further addressed. A litterbag study (Walker H. 2005) was included in the dossier and this study did not show any effects of bifenthrin to the litter bag decomposition. Member State experts at the PRAPeR 52 meeting agreed that for pyrethroid compounds, the litter bag study does not cover the potential for there being a risk for soil macro organisms. A data gap was identified to the applicant to address the risk to non-target soil macro organisms. The risk to non-target plants needs to be addressed. The risk to micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the applied for representative uses evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cyflufenamid,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.258r,"Cyflufenamid is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/636/EC3. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State, the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on cyflufenamid, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available, which was received by EFSA on 30 January 2006. The peer review was initiated on 10 May 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation of the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in May 2007. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November-December 2007. A final consultation on the outcome of the experts. discussion took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying to winter and spring cereals against powdery mildew. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, NF-149 EW., an oil-in-water emulsion EW), containing 50 g/L cyflufenamid. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data requirement was identified in relation to the method for plants. A data requirement was identified for a monitoring method for the residues in food of animal origin. In mammals, cyflufenamid is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal or inhalation routes; it is not a skin or eye irritant or skin sensitiser. In the short-term toxicity studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing alterations in the liver function and brain vacuolation. The relevant oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level NOAEL) is 4.1 mg/kg bw/day 1-year dog study). Cyflufenamid did not show any genotoxic potential. Increased incidences of thyroid tumours and hepatocellular adenomas were observed in male rats and mice, respectively, however, these were not considered to be of relevance for the risk assessment. The relevant NOAEL from the long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is 4.4 mg/kg bw/day rat study). No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats: the relevant parental and offspring NOAEL is 18 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 57 mg/kg bw/day. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, cyflufenamid did not cause malformations in the rat or rabbit: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day rat and rabbit, respectively); the relevant developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day highest dose level tested) for rat, and 10 mg/kg bw/day for rabbit based on skeletal effects enlarged anterior fontanels and retardation of ossification). The Acceptable Daily Intake ADI) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the chronic rat study applying a safety factor SF) of 100. The Acute Reference Dose ARfD) is 0.05 mg/kg bw NOAEL for maternal toxicity from the developmental rabbit studies, SF of 100). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day rounded) is based on the 1-year dog study with a correction for oral absorption of 70% and a safety factor of 100. The operator, worker and bystander exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment. The metabolism of cyflufenamid was investigated in wheat and rotational crops. The metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides cyflufenamid, its E-isomer 149-E)-FB4 and further metabolites 149-F-2-OH-B5, 149-F-4-OH-B6, 149-F-a-OH-B7, 149-F8 and 149-F4BGlu9) were identified. The meeting of experts decided to include the E-isomer in the residue definition for plant matrices based on the assumption that the analytical methods used in the residue trials and for monitoring cannot separate the two isomers. The notifier was asked to confirm this assumption. Based on the results of a confined rotational crop study, no residues above the LOQ are expected in parts of rotational crops intended for human consumption. Dietary burden calculations showed a significant intake of cyflufenamid through cereal straw and grain for dairy and beef cattle only. A metabolism study on ruminants was submitted and showed low transfer of residues into milk and tissues. Cyflufenamid was the main radioactive component in fat. However, in other tissues and milk, the metabolite 149-F110 was the main radioactive component. The meeting of experts decided to include 149-(E)-FB and 149-F1 in the residue definitions for animal matrices. It was concluded that bioaccumulation of cyflufenamid is not expected, and that no significant residues are expected in food of animal origin after feeding with cereal grain and straw treated according to the notified cGAP. MRLs for wheat, triticale, rye and barley were proposed provisionally on the basis of the residue trials on wheat and barley, pending confirmation that the analytical method used in the residue trials covers the residue definition for food in plant matrices. MRLs for animal matrices should be set at the LOQ when an analytical method for animal products is available. A chronic and acute dietary intake estimate was carried out by the rapporteur Member State. The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) was below 1% of the ADI and the national estimated short-term intake (NESTI) maximum 2% for all considered consumer groups. In soil under aerobic conditions cyflufenamid exhibits low to high persistence forming the soil metabolites: 149-F (low to moderate persistence), 149-F1111 (low persistence), 149-F1 (high to very high persistence), 149-F612 (very high persistence). Mineralisation to carbon dioxide represented less than 0.1% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in the fluorinated phenyl-labelled study, and represented 49.8% AR at 45 days in the cyclopropyl-labelled study. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 27.0-36.8% AR after 45-120 days. Cyflufenamid exhibits slight to low mobility in soil, with the four metabolites indicated above exhibiting very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of any of these compounds was pH dependant. In dark natural sediment-water systems cyflufenamid dissipated from the water phase with a first-order DT50 of 3.6-5.0 days. Cyflufenamid partitioned to the sediment with a peak concentration measured 14 days after dosing of 63.0-64.8% AR. The more prominent degradation products in both systems were 149-F11 (maximum 15.5% AR in water and maximum 6.8% AR in sediment) and 149-F (maximum 7.1% AR in water and maximum 8.6% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for a maximum of 0.5-3.5% of the applied fluorinated phenyl-U-[C-14] cyflufenamid. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 8.4-19.1% of this radiolabel at the study end. The available surface water exposure assessment for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 only considered the spray drift route of entry to surface water bodies, as FOCUS SW was not available when the DAR of cyflufenamid was written. The potential contamination of ground water by cyflufenamid and its soil metabolites 149-F, 149-F1, 149-F6 and 149-F11, when used according to the proposed representative uses, was assessed with FOCUS GW PELMO (v. 3.3.2) model and the relevant scenarios. The results showed that for cyflufenamid and for the metabolites 149-F and 149-F11 no annual average concentration in the percolate at 1m soil depth exceeding 0.001 mu g/L is to be expected. The concentrations for the metabolite 149-F1 are in the range of 0.011 - 0.546 mu g/L. The concentration of 0.1 mu g/L is exceeded in 7 out of 9 European FOCUS scenarios parameterised for winter cereals. For the metabolite 149-F6 the estimated PECgw are > 0.75 mu g/L in all the simulated scenarios (80th percentile annual average concentration at 1m ranged from 1.566 rho g/L to 5.623 mu g/L). The toxicological assessment was able to conclude that the metabolites 149-F1 and 149-F6 are not relevant concerning groundwater at the expected concentrations. Cyflufenamid is not expected to be transferred to the atmospheric compartment and the potential for long-range transport may be considered negligible. The acute, short-term and long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and the acute and long-term risk for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals was low for the representative uses in cereals at an application rate of 25 g a. s./ha. The risk from secondary poisoning and from the uptake of contaminated drinking water to birds and mammals can be considered as low. Aquatic organisms were more sensitive to the lead formulation, NF-149 EW.. The potential exposure of surface water with the parent compound cyflufenamid and the soil major metabolites 149-F, 149-F1 and 149-F11 via the drainage and run-off routes of entry has not been assessed. The EFSA considers that the main route of exposure was via drift. Therefore, in case the new PECsw for the run-off and drainage are considered, it is expected that these would be lower than those obtained with the drift. The risk to aquatic organisms for the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites can be regarded as low for exposure via drift. The resulting BCF (bioconcentration factor) exceeds the Annex VI trigger value of 100 for not readily biodegradable compounds. Nevertheless, the risk from bioconcentration in fish is considered to be low as more than 95% depuration was observed in 14 days. Low acute and chronic risk to earthworms was assessed from the representative uses of cyflufenamid and its relevant metabolites. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants and biological methods for sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cadusafos,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.262r,"Cadusafos is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU- Commission. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on cadusafos in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 1 June 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June and July 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 68) Following the Commission Decision of 18 June 2007 (2007/428/EC) 4 concerning the noninclusion of cadusafos in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier FMC Chemical made a resubmission application for the inclusion of cadusafos in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows: the potential contamination of groundwater. the operators exposure. the risk to birds and mammals. its possible impact on non-target organisms Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted the additional report on cadusafos to the EFSA on 15 October 2008. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA dispatched the additional report to Member States and the notifier for consultation. The comments received were subsequently submitted to the Commission for evaluation. In accordance with Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the Commission subsequently requested the EFSA, by letter received on 8 January 2009, to arrange a peer review of the evaluation, i. e. the additional report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review was initiated on 14 January 2009 by dispatching the comments received on the additional report to the rapporteur Member State for examination. The rapporteur provided a response to the comments in the reporting table, which was subsequently evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues to be further considered in a series of scientific meetings via teleconferences with Member State experts in March 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March-April 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis, mammalian toxicology, residues, environmental fate and behaviour, and ecotoxicology. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide and nematicide as presented in the DAR, which comprise application by spraying or via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in potatoes and bananas at application rates of up to 6 kg cadusafos per hectare. In case of potatoes incorporation into soil takes place after the application. It should be noted that during the peer review process the applicant stated that only the use in bananas will be supported in the EU review process. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as insecticide and nematicide, which comprise application via the drip irrigation system to control a range of soil insects and nematodes in bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. It should be noted that the use on potatoes was not supported in the resubmission application either, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative uses presented in the additional report, i.e. only the use on bananas at application rates of up to 4 kg cadusafos per hectare. The risk assessment presented for potatoes has not been updated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Rugby 200 CS., a capsule suspension (CS). Preparations containing cadusafos were registered in Cyprus, France, Greece and Spain. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate analytical methods are available to monitor cadusafos in food of plant origin, environmental matrices and body fluids and tissues. The absorption of cadusafos is extensive and rapid; the excretion is mainly via urine, without evidence of body accumulation. The acute oral toxicity is high, and the acute inhalation and dermal toxicity are very high. The proposed classification is T+, R26/27 ""Very toxic by inhalation and in contact with skin""; T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". The main effect after short-term oral administration is the decrease of cholinesterase activities in all species. Cadusafos has no genotoxic potential and is not considered to be carcinogenic. In the two-generation rat study, there was no effect on reproductive performance or fertility, and in the rat-and rabbit teratology studies, there was no evidence of teratogenic effects in the absence of maternal toxicity. Supplementary studies were performed due to the introduction of a new impurity in the technical material. The acute and subchronic oral tests revealed no difference in toxicity. The Ames test was negative but not valid. A further assessment of the genotoxic potential of the impurity was required. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.0004 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.0007 mg/kg bw/day, and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.003 mg/kg bw. The comparison of the oral and dermal LD50 values results in a dermal absorption value of 100%. The operator exposure estimates are based solely on one specific and restricted representative use in bananas, with automatic drip irrigation, work rate of 1 ha/day, application rate of 4 kg a. s./ha, and assuming that the microcapsules in the formulation do not release cadusafos until they are diluted for application. The results are below the AOEL, with the use of gloves, according to the currently used models, which do not apply properly to this particular scenario. Worker and bystander exposures are expected to be very low due to the mode of application by drip irrigation. The metabolism of cadusafos has been investigated on several crops after soil application. The use on potatoes can be considered as adequately covered by these data and the residue definition for this use can be cadusafos only, for both monitoring and risk assessment. The available residue trials in potatoes for Southern Europe are however not sufficient to draw a robust conclusion on the residue levels consumers may be exposed to. The available data suggest that residues are below 0.01 mg/kg, but results from trials in Northern Europe indicate that the currently available data may underestimate the actual situation. Further supervised residue trials should be carried out. For the representative use on bananas, two metabolism studies for this crop were originally submitted, and the data were not sufficient to propose a residue definition. This was due to major deficiencies in the studies, making it impossible to evaluate the possible presence of degradation products still exhibiting the anticholinesterase activity of the parent compound. Therefore, a new metabolism study in bananas was needed, as well as residue trials carried out according to the representative use pattern. The situation for rotational crops has not been addressed by the notifier, although the soil persistence of the compound exceeds the trigger value for conducting uptake and metabolism studies in succeeding crops. Therefore these studies should be requested. Based on the current knowledge of the residue situation in potatoes, the exposure of livestock is very low and metabolism studies in domestic animals do not need to be carried out. Only preliminary acute and chronic exposure assessments could be conducted for the use on potatoes, but these assessments need to be re-examined on the basis of complete and robust data. No MRLs can be proposed at this stage. In the resubmission, only the use on banana is supported with a lower application rate of 4 kg as/ha instead of 6 kg as/ha, and a harvest interval of 90 days instead of 14 days. A new plant metabolism study showed that no significant metabolites are formed. None of the minor metabolites formed will have the anticholinesterase activity of cadusafos. The study confirms that the residue definition is cadusafos only. Overdosed residue trials showed that no significant residues will be present at harvest even with shorter harvest intervals. A TMDI calculation using the EFSA model showed that the highest intakes were < 5% of the ADI. The acute risk assessment gave intakes at < 30 % of the ARfD. The proposed MRL for banana is 0.01* mg/kg. It should be noted however, that cadusafos has two chiral carbons and it is not known if the ratio of the isomers remains the same as the material tested in the mammalian toxicity studies. The available data demonstrate that in soil cadusafos degrades to the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone5. Mineralisation of the butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 43-71% AR after 90-120 days incubation at 25 degrees C. The values for residues not extracted by acetonitrile/water were 25-32% AR after 90-120 days. In soil cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and methyl-2-butyl sulfone exhibited low persistence, though this categorisation for methyl-2-butyl sulfone is based only a single experimental DT50 value. In guideline batch soil adsorption studies cadusafos exhibited medium mobility. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. Data on the adsorption of methyl-2-butyl sulfone were not available. As this metabolite accounted for > 5% AR at two consecutive sampling points in a soil route of degradation study, data on its mobility in soil are required to enable a groundwater exposure assessment for this metabolite to be carried out. In sediment water systems cadusafos exhibited moderate persistence and produced no major metabolites. It dissipated by partitioning to sediment, volatilising and mineralising to CO2 (butyl-2-[C-14] radiolabel accounted for 12-18% AR after 100 days incubation at 20 degrees C). Residues not extracted from sediment by acetonitrile/water accounted for only 6-8% AR at 100 days. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on bananas (application via drip irrigation) just in Tenerife indicated that surface water exposure and consequently sediment exposure would be negligible. This conclusion is specific to this use in Tenerife and should not be applied to bananas grown elsewhere. The available aquatic exposure assessment from the use on potatoes is appropriate for addressing just the spray drift route of entry to surface water for initial PEC in aquatic systems. Surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessments from the run-off and drainage routes of entry are not available for the potato use. The available FOCUS groundwater modelling for bananas in Tenerife for the parent cadusafos and for the metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone are not satisfactory, and the potential for groundwater contamination is therefore currently unclear. New groundwater modelling is therefore required for cadusafos and for the soil metabolite methyl-2-butyl sulfone. Cadusafos is moderately volatile and volatilisation will contribute to dissipation from soil and water. However, cadusafos is not expected to be subject to long-range transport via the upper atmosphere due to a relatively rapid calculated photochemical oxidative degradation rate with hydroxyl radicals. In the first-tier assessment an acute and long-term risk was identified for insectivorous birds. A risk was also identified for earthworm-eating birds and mammals, as well as for fish-eating birds and mammals for the use in potatoes. Since the use in potatoes was withdrawn by the applicant, the refinements of the risk to birds and mammals from this use were not further considered. For the use in banana plantations a high risk was identified for insectivorous and earthwormeating birds and mammals in a first-tier risk assessment. The proposed refinement was not accepted by the experts due to the lack of supporting data. However, due to the mode of application (drip-irrigation), only 16% of the in-field area is treated, leaving the majority of food items uncontaminated (the exposure of epigaec insects was considered negligible). This information could be used in a weight of evidence approach for a qualitative risk assessment. Cadusafos is very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The assessment indicates a high risk. However, for the specific use in banana plantations in Tenerife, the risk to aquatic organisms is considered low based on negligible contamination of surface water. The toxicity to bees is high, but since for the proposed uses application will be to bare soil, the risk is considered low. No in-field exposure of leaf-dwelling non-target arthropods is expected from the evaluated uses. For the application of cadusafos by drip irrigation to banana plants no off-field exposure is expected. No new data was provided with the resubmission dossier. No further data was considered necessary for the use in banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area. A high acute and long-term risk was identified for earthworms. The field study conducted in the United Kingdom was considered not appropriate for the risk assessment for banana plantations. A data gap was identified to provide information on the potential for recolonisation of earthworms in the treated area of banana plantations, or alternatively, a study on effects on earthworm populations in banana plantations. A study with Collembola and mites was required to address the risk to other soil macroorganisms. No study with Collembola was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the experts considered further data not necessary for banana plantations, since only 16% of the in-field area is treated leaving enough uncontaminated refuges, which would allow the recolonisation of the treated area. The risk to soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment plants is low. For the drip irrigation use in banana no off-crop exposure is expected, and hence the risk to non-target plants is considered low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance lufenuron,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.189r,"Lufenuron is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on lufenuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 20 April 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Syngenta Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on grapes and tomatoes as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Match 050 EC"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a modified multi-method (The German S19 method). The extraction procedure was as detailed in S19 however, the analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS which is a detection method not used in the multi-method. For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of lufenuron. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The outstanding issue is that the specification is not agreed. With regard to its toxicological properties, lufenuron has shown a potential of bioaccumulation in fat, and a systemic bioavailability of 70%, with a very low metabolism. During the acute toxicity testing, lufenuron showed skin sensitisation properties and the classification as R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed. In oral short term studies with different species, clinical signs of neurotoxicity (tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions) and liver changes were observed, as well as some deaths in one dog study resulting in the proposed classification Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"". No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential was detected in the available studies. In the long term studies, the incidence and severity of the convulsions in both species were also taken into account for the setting of the NOAELs. No specific adverse effect on fertility or embryofoetal development was observed in the studies for reproductive toxicity, with low maternal toxicity (reduced body weight) and minimal offspring toxicity (delayed righting reflex). In a 4-month neurotoxicity study with rats, convulsions or fasciculations were induced at the high dose without any impairment of motor/cognitive functions or histopathological changes in the nervous system. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the second 1-year dog study (Altman, 1995), and the agreed systemic acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.01 mg/kg bw/day using the same dog study but applying a correction factor for bioavailability (70%). Both reference values were derived with the use of a safety factor of 100. The setting of an acute reference dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The agreed dermal absorption values for humans were 13% for the dilution and 2% for the concentrate. The operator exposure estimates with the German model for use in field or in greenhouse didn't show exposure levels above the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment. The metabolism of lufenuron has been tested in three crop categories namely tomato (fruits), cabbage (leafy crop) and cotton (pulses and oilseeds). Lufenuron is always the major component of the residue, no significant metabolites were found. It was concluded that the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is lufenuron. A full set of residue trials were supplied for grapes in the north and south of Europe. A full set of residues trials data were available for protected tomatoes; a reduced data set was accepted for outdoor tomatoes in the south as the use is much less critical. The stability of residues in freezer storage was demonstrated for a period of two years. Sufficient processing data were submitted for tomatoes and grapes which showed an overall reduction of the residues in processed commodities. The rotational crop studies demonstrated that residues of lufenuron are unlikely to occur in crops planted after the treated crop is harvested. Given that lufenuron is lipophilic it is unlikely to be taken up by plants. The only possible issue would be soil contamination but this will easily be removed during preparation of food before consumption. From the representative uses in grape and tomato evaluated there is no animal intake according to the current guidance. However, metabolism studies in hens and goats were provided that demonstrated that the only significant residue that will be present is lufenuron. Feeding studies were also provided but it can not be concluded if the dose levels were appropriate, because there is no animal consumption expected for the representative crops. Lufenuron is a pair of enantiomers and it is currently not addressed if the ratio remains the same in the plant metabolism. Potentially the consumer risk assessment could under estimate the risk by a factor of 2 (assuming the residue is only 1 isomer and all the toxicity comes from it). For the UK consumer model intakes were highest for the vegetarian population subgroup at 10 % of the ADI using the STMR and 80% of the ADI when using the proposed MRLs. For the WHO European diet the TMDI was 3.42 % and IEDI was 0.62 %. For the Portuguese diet the TMDI was 20.22% and the NEDI was 2.63%. An acute risk assessment has not been conducted as an ARfD has not been set. In soil under aerobic conditions lufenuron exhibits high to very high persistence forming the major soil metabolites CGA 2382772 (max. 32% applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and CGA 2244433 ( max. 33% AR) which exhibits moderate to medium persistence. Under sunlight the major metabolite CGA 1497724 can be formed (max. 1 I%AR) which exhibits low persistence. Mineralisation of the dichlorophenyl ring to carbon dioxide was relatively limited accounting for 1-7 % AR after 91-100 days; this value for the difluorophenyl ring was 34% AR at 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 17-59% AR (range for both rings) after 90-100 days. Lufenuron is immobile in soil. CGA 238277 exhibits slight mobility, CGA 224443 is immobile or exhibits slight mobility and CGA 149772 exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either lufenuron or these metabolites were pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems lufenuron partitioned rapidly to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting moderate to high persistence in sediment, to the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 which exhibited moderate and high persistence respectively. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for only 0.2 % AR of the dichlorophenyl ring by 90 days but 11.8-36% AR for the difluorophenyl ring at 90 days. Unextracted sediment residues were a sink representing 6-15% AR and 12-37% AR for each radiolabel respectively at 90 days). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for lufenuron at steps 1-4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolites CGA 238277 and CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 that may leach from soil to surface water appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Information on the fate and behaviour in soil and water of the individual enantiomers of lufenuron is not available. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by lufenuron, CGA 238277, CGA 224443 and CGA 149772 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute toxicity to birds and mammals and the short-term toxicity to birds were considered to be low from exposure to lufenuron. Long-term reproductive endpoints of 19.7 and 8.7 mg a.s./kg bw/d were agreed by Member State experts for birds and mammals respectively. TERs from the standard tier 1 risk assessment indicated a low risk for all intended outdoor uses, except for the risk to small herbivorous mammals from the use in vine. A refined risk assessment provided after the peer-review and agreed by EFSA indicated a low risk, based on a vine foliar interception factor of 70%. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water from puddle was assessed as low. The risk from secondary poisoning for the worst-case vine use was assessed as low, based on a no-spray buffer zone of 5 m and 10 m respectively for fish eating birds and mammals. The potential for biomagnification was assessed as high for birds and mammals. Food-chain modelling indicated a low risk for all steps of the food chain for the worst case use in vine, based on appropriate mitigation measures (e.g. no-spray buffer zones). No mitigation measures were required for the tomato use. The risk to birds and mammals from the metabolite CGA 224443 was assessed as low by the RMS after the peer-review. The toxicity of lufenuron suggested a classification as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The lowest acute end point value for Daphnia magna was an EC50 of 0.4 mu g a.s./L, based on a formulation study. The lowest chronic toxicity to fish (NOEC=20 mu g a.s./L) was identified from a fish full life cycle study. A lower NOEC of 2 mu g a.s./L could potentially be derived from a chronic toxicity study with fish, pending further statistical analysis. The chronic study to daphnia was not accepted by member state experts. No new study was required as chronic toxicity to invertebrates was covered by a microcosm study. A NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L from the microcosm study was agreed by member state experts with an assessment factor of 2-3. The aquatic risk assessment for the tomato use indicated a low risk, based on the microcosm endpoint and no-spray buffer zones of 5 m. For use in vine a low risk was identified, based on a no-spray buffer zone of approximately 25 m. The latter assessment would be based on an assessment factor of 2. Application of an assessment factor of 3 would require further refinement of the risk characterisation for potentially more susceptible FOCUS surface water scenarios. The risk to sediment dwellers from lufenuron exposure was assessed as low in case of a no spray buffer zone of 5 m, as well as the risk from the relevant metabolites. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification was assessed, resulting in a BCF of 28.000 and a slow elimination rate. Risk assessment based on food-chain modelling suggested a low risk to fish, also considering the potential lower toxicity of 2 mu g a.s./L from the chronic fish toxicity study. First tier risk assessment indicated a risk to bees. As the higher tier field studies were not accepted by member state experts, lufenuron should not be applied during the flowering season of the GAP crops. Further data were required to address the risk to bees from treated flowering weeds. The initial risk assessment to non-target arthropods from lufenuron (IGR) indicated a potential high risk. The higher tier field study was not accepted by member state experts. Further data were required to address the risk to non-target arthropods. The assessment of soil non-target macro-organisms indicated a potential high risk to collembola. The higher tier litter bag study provided to address the risk was not accepted by member state experts, as the exposure did not cover the expected plateau PECoil. Further data were required to address the risk. The risk to earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance quizalofop-P (considered variants quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl) Issued on 26 November 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.205r,"Quizalofop-P is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(1) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted a DAR on the variant quizalofop-Pethyl and a DAR on the variant quizalofop-P-tefuryl in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which were received by the EFSA on 1 February 2007 and 2 May 2007 respectively. The peer review was initiated on 24 October 2007 by dispatching the DARs for consultation of the Member States and the respective notifiers Nissan Chemical Europe SARL and Chemtura Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DARs were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting tables. These tables were evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of quizalofop-Pethyl as a herbicide on sugar beet and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as a herbicide on oilseed rape, sugar/fodder beet, potato, combining pea, field beans, linseed and sunflower. Full details of the good agricultural practice (GAP) can be found in the attached list of endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation of quizalofop-P-ethyl was 'Targa Super', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). For quizalofop-P-tefuryl the representative formulation was 'Panarex' (also known as 'Pantera'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). For food of plant and animal origin none of the methods supplied comply with the residue definition. For environmental matrices sufficient methods are available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. The specification for the ethyl variant was not accepted as further justification is required. Data gaps for surface tension and persistent foam were identified. For the tefuryl variant the specification was acceptable for section 1, although there is an outstanding question on the formation of the isomeric impurity of quizalofop. A data gap was identified for a method of analysis to separate the R and S isomers (note this is not the R and S isomers in the tefuryl part of the molecule). A data gap was also identified for kinematic viscosity for aspiration hazard classification. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl tested in mammalian toxicology is ""Harmful if swallowed"" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral Lethal Dose - LD50 1012 mg/kg bw); it has low dermal and inhalation toxicity (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and Lethal Concentration - LC50 >3.9 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-tefuryl is not a skin or eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser in Magnusson-Kligman test (Xn; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed). Short-term toxicity target organs were liver and testes. In rodents, the relevant No Observed Adverse Effect Level - NOAEL (rat study) was 1.7 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weights, accentuated lobulation of the liver and haematological and clinical chemistry findings at 33.4 mg/kg bw/day. Kidney, testis and body weights were decreased at 134 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl did not show genotoxic concern. In long-term toxicity studies the relevant NOAEL is 1.3 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl caused an increased incidence of rare renal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as a clear treatment related increase in the Leydig cell tumours in rats; the liver tumours occurring in rodents were not relevant to humans. On this basis Carc Cat, 3; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. In the two-generation rat study, the NOAEL for parental and offspring was 1.4 mg/kg bw/day based on increased liver weight and liver hypertrophy in adult males and females, vacuolar changes in pituitary in adult males, decreased body weights during lactation in F1 generation and decreased viability during early lactation. The NOAEL for reproduction was 16.9 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats the maternal NOAEL was set at 10 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on increased postimplantation loss per dam with concomitant lower number of viable foetuses and increased number of malformations at maternally toxic dose. In rabbits, the NOAEL was 20 mg/kg bw/day for maternal and developmental toxicity. However, the rabbit was not adequately tested but this was considered not to preclude concluding on the risk assessment. Due to the limitations of the studies, Repr. Cat. 3; R63? (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"") was agreed for proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.013 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of the 2-year study in rats, SF 100. The NOAEL of 1.7 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day rat study was the most relevant NOAEL, also based on its dosing regime, and applying a 60% correction factor (limited oral absorption) and SF 100 resulted in an Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 0.1 mg/kg bw was based on the maternal toxicity seen in the rat developmental study with a SF 100 applied. The estimated operator exposure exceeded the AOEL without the use of PPE, as well as with PPE but only with the UK POEM. The exposure was estimated below the AOEL (13%) applying the German model, with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application and coverall and sturdy footwear during application. The exposure for workers re-entering the field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers re-entering in ornamentals the use of gloves is needed). Quizalofop-P-ethyl is ""Harmful if swallowed"" (Xn; R22 proposed based on oral LD50 1182 mg/kg bw); dermal and inhalation acute toxicity is low (LD50 >5000 mg/kg bw and LC50 5.8 mg/L air, respectively). Quizalofop-P-ethyl is not a skin or eye irritant, nor does it show any sensitisation potential. Target organ in repeat dose studies was shown to be the liver. The lowest short-term NOAEL for quizalofop-P-ethyl is 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in mice study after 13-week (90-day) dietary administration, whereas the relevant long- term NOAEL is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day (2-year study in rats). Quizalofop-P-ethyl did not exhibit genotoxic or carcinogenic properties relevant to humans. It is not a reproductive or developmental toxicant: the NOAEL for offspring is 2.4 mg/kg bw/day based on hepatoxicity; the parental NOAEL is 9.4 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight during premating period, whereas the reproductive NOAEL is 37.8 mg/kg bw/day, highest dose tested. The maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats is 30 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight gain and food consumption, increased resorptions and skeletal variations at >= 100 mg/kg bw/day. In rabbits, no malformations were observed up to doses of 60 mg/kg bw/day, which represented the NOAEL for developmental toxicity, whereas the maternal NOAEL for dams was 30 mg/kg bw/day based on slightly decreased body weight and food consumption and decreased thymus and thyroid weights at 60 mg/kg bw/day. Quizalofop-P-ethyl does not have a potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.009 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-yr rat study with an SF 100; The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day mouse study with an SF 100 (corrected for limited oral absorption of 67%). Due to the toxicological profile of quizalofop-P-ethyl, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not triggered. The operator exposure assessment was estimated to be below the AOEL (26%) with the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE, with the German model). The exposure for workers re-entering field for crop inspection and the bystander estimated exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL (for workers the use of gloves is needed). For both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism in plants was investigated in potato, cotton and soya; the ethyl variant was additionally investigated in sugar beet. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, one radioactive label was investigated and considering the insufficient metabolite characterisation in some studies, the meeting concluded that new studies labelled in a second position need to be provided. For both variants, the metabolism proceeds primarily by the hydrolysis of the ester link to yield quizalofop (acid) followed by the loss of the propionyl moiety leading to the quizalofop-phenol metabolite. Further metabolism occurs by hydroxylation of the quinoxaline moiety giving the hydroxy-quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol and the dihydroxy-quizalofop-phenol. In addition, the presence of the quinoxaline and phenoxy metabolites indicated a cleavage of the parent molecule. Parts of these different metabolites were also found as conjugates. The meeting discussed whether the phenoxy propionate and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol metabolites which were observed in beet foliage and soya meal in similar amounts to the tefuryl ester or to quizalofop, have to be included in the plant residue definition and if they have to be taken into account in the animal feeding. Finally and provisionally, the experts decided not to include these compounds in the residue definition, awaiting a statement on their toxicological relevance, and proposed the following residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for each individual ester variant: ""Sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"" Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three quizalofop ester variants, a common residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was also proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl as: ""Sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop and quizalofop conjugates expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers)"" These definitions should remain provisional, pending the submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information. After the meeting and considering that conjugates were mainly detected in immature soya and cotton plants, the EFSA proposed not to include these conjugates in the residue definitions, especially for monitoring since the ethyl variant, tefuryl variant and quizalofop seem to be sufficient markers for the residues in plants. In addition for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the meeting was of the opinion that the metabolism pattern has not been sufficiently described in root crops. No characterisations were performed in potato tubers and a substantial part of the extracted radioactivity was not identified in the sugar beet. Therefore, it was concluded that these studies were not sufficient to validate the proposed residue definition on the root/tuber plant group, especially on potato. However, and considering that no metabolites are expected at significant levels in sugar beet root, it was agreed that the proposed residue definition could be applied to beet root. The notifier was requested to provide further information concerning the unidentified fractions observed in the beet studies, unless a new metabolism study has to be submitted for tuber/root crops. For quizalofop-P-ethyl, supervised residue trials were submitted to support a single representative use on sugar beet only. The trials performed with the highest LOQ of 0.10 mg/kg were removed from the data set and a MRL of 0.05 mg/kg was proposed for sugar beet roots. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a sufficient number of residue trials were submitted to propose MRLs on potato, sugar beet, bean, pea, lentil, oilseed rape, linseed, soya and sunflower. Samples were analysed using a method quantifying separately the parent quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its free and conjugated metabolites (including quizalofop) which can be converted to 2-methoxy-6-chloroquinoxaline, but this method was only validated for the tefuryl variant and quizalofop. This method was considered as appropriate in the framework of this peer review since its scope is wider than the compounds included in the proposed residue definition. The storage stability study showed that quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues are stable for at least 16 months in beet matrices. However, an additional study on oil/protein matrices was requested in order to support the results of the rotational crop study. Quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop residues were shown to be stable up to 12 - 24 months in a wider range of plant matrices (soya beans, cotton seeds, rape seed oil and cake, potato tubers). A degradation from the ester quizalofop-P-tefuryl to quizalofop was observed in beet matrices after one month, but generally recoveries were more than 80% when both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop residues were added up. Clarifications were requested concerning the different analytical methods used in these storage stability studies and especially concerning the validation for ""bound residues"". No processing study was provided for quizalofop-P-ethyl as no residues were detected in beet roots following the use of the active substance as stated in the critical GAP. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, a standard hydrolytic study was provided but for the boiling condition only and a new study covering the full range of the processing conditions was requested. No processing factors could be derived from the rapeseed study since the residues detected in all processed fractions (crude oil, refined oil, pressed cake etc.) were considered to be not consistent with the initial levels observed in seeds. A new processing study was requested, unless clarifications could be provided. On potatoes, the residue levels were not affected in boiled potatoes but were increased in fried potatoes. The compounds detected in the rotational crops studies performed with quizalofop-ethyl (racemate) and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were also present in the primary crops, suggesting a similar metabolic pathway in both primary and rotational crops. Considering the residue levels observed in these studies, it was concluded that no significant residues of quizalofop-ethyl, quizalofop-P-tefuryl and of their metabolites are expected in rotational crops. The metabolism in animals was investigated using the racemate quizalofop-ethyl labelled on the phenyl and quinoxaline moieties in the goat study but only on the quinoxaline moiety in the hen study. This single radio-labelling was considered as sufficient in the scope of this peer review, since the intended use on sugar beet does not lead to significant intake by poultry. For quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the metabolism studies on goat and hen were conducted using a single label only. Considering that the characterisation/identification of the metabolites was insufficiently investigated in some animal matrices, a new study using a second labelling position was requested. Similar metabolic pathways were observed for both ester variants, starting with rapid hydrolysis of the ester bond leading to the acid quizalofop and followed by hydroxylation or further hydrolysis giving the hydroxy-quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop-phenol, these metabolites being subject to conjugation. In the hen study, quizalofop-pentanoic acid was also observed as a major metabolite in liver and kidney. The very low proportion of quinoxaline metabolites (<1% TRR) indicated limited cleavage of the parent molecule. Considering the comparative metabolite distribution in rat and goat for quizalofop-P-ethyl, the experts discussed whether a supplementary metabolism study in pig should be requested. The metabolism in rat and ruminants was similar qualitatively but differences were observed quantitatively. Higher residues were detected in rat on an equivalent mg/kg bw basis, some differences being of a 10-fold magnitude. Before asking for a pig metabolism study, it was suggested to ask the notifiers to provide explanations for these quantitative differences. No comparison was possible for quizalofop-P-tefuryl since the dosages of the metabolites in rat and goat were performed at different time points. Finally and provisionally the meeting of experts proposed the following residue definitions for each individual variant: For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-ester and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers). For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-ester, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers). Considering the metabolism studies performed with the three ester variants, the meeting of experts concluded that the following common residue definitions can be proposed for propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl: For monitoring: sum of quizalofop-esters and quizalofop expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers). For risk assessment: sum of quizalofop-esters, quizalofop pentanoic acid and quizalofop, expressed as quizalofop (sum of isomers). These definitions should remain provisional, pending submission and the evaluation of the requested additional information and the statement on the toxicological relevance of some metabolites. No feeding studies were submitted for quizalofop-P-ethyl and considering the metabolism studies performed with an exaggerated dose rate, it was concluded that no significant residues are expected in animal matrices resulting from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet. Feeding studies in cow and hen were submitted for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Taking into account the transfer in animal products and the theoretical animal burden resulting from the representative uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl, residue levels above the LOQs are expected in ruminant kidney and in poultry liver, kidney and fat. MRLs were proposed for these animal products. The stability of the residues in products of animal origin was however considered as insufficiently demonstrated and the notifier was asked to provide new data. Using the EFSA consumer model and considering the representative use of quizalofop-P-ethyl on sugar beet, no chronic concern was observed, the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) being less than 13% of the ADI (0.009 mg/kg bw/d). Considering the MRLs proposed for plant and animal products, no chronic and acute concerns were observed for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the maximum TMDI using the EFSA model being 23% of the ADI (0.013 mg/kg bw/d) and the maximum international estimated short-term intake (IESTI), 31% of the ARfD (0.1 mg/kg bw/d). Awaiting the additional information/ clarification requested during the peer review process, provisional MRLs were proposed for sugar beet, potato, bean and pea (without pods), lentils, soybeans, oil seed rape and sunflower. MRLs were also proposed for products of animal origin, based on the quizalofop-P-tefuryl representative uses. In the environmental fate and behaviour section, the data sets for the common metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline available in the DARs of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were combined in order to derive a single set of endpoints (amalgamated list of endpoints) for the fate properties of each metabolite to use in the environmental exposure assessment. In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-tefuryl exhibits very low persistence forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 101.5% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to high persistence, hydroxy-quizalofop (accounting for up to 21% AR) which exhibits low to medium persistence, dihydroxy-quinoxaline (accounting for up to 18% AR) which exhibits moderate to high persistence, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (accounting for up to 59% AR) which exhibits very low persistence. The metabolite tetrahydrofuroic acid (up to 9.3% AR) was present at levels that trigger a groundwater exposure assessment. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring, the furfuryl group or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 2.3 - 70% AR after 30 - 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 15 - 50% AR after 30 - 120 days. Due to the rapid degradation of quizalofop-P-tefuryl in soil under aerobic conditions, batch equilibrium studies with the parent compound were not performed. A worst case value of 0 mL/g and 1/n = 1 was selected for use in FOCUS scenario calculations of groundwater exposure potential. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxyquinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites is pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems quizalofop-P-tefuryl degraded very rapidly to the metabolites quizalofop (max. 94% AR in water and max. 53% AR in the sediment) tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (max. 16.5% AR in the water), tetrahydrofuroic acid (max. 39.1% AR in the water), CQOP (max. 11.6% in the sediment) and dihydroxy-quinoxaline (max. 16.4% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for quizalofop-P-tefuryl. After the peer review for metabolites quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop, the EFSA performed new FOCUS SW calculations at Steps 1 and 2 using the endpoints agreed in the amalgamated list of endpoints. The recalculated initial predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was used in the toxicity exposure ratio (TER) calculations for these two metabolites. For metabolites CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofuroic acid and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol no reliable PECsw and predicted environmental concentration in sediment (PECsed) were available. However, as the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to CQOP, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is assessed to be low when the initial PEC values for quizalofop are used, no further assessment is required for these metabolites. No recalculations for tetrahydrofuroic acid were necessary. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-tefuryl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, dihydroxy-quinoxaline, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofuroic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. In soil under aerobic conditions quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to very low persistence, forming the major soil metabolites quizalofop (accounting for up to 84% AR) which exhibits low to high persistence, metabolite hydroxy-quizalofop accounting for up to 16% AR which exhibits low to medium persistence, and metabolite dihydroxy-quinoxaline accounting for up to 12% AR which exhibits moderate to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring or the quinoxaline group to carbon dioxide accounted for 1.8 - 32% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 23 - 42% AR after 120 days. Quizalofop-P-ethyl exhibits low to slight mobility in soil. Quizalofop and hydroxy-quizalofop exhibit low to high mobility in soil, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline exhibits low to very high mobility in soil. There was no indication in the available data that adsorption of either quizalofop-P-tefuryl or its identified soil metabolites was pH dependent. In dark natural water/sediment systems quizalofop-P-ethyl degraded very rapidly to the metabolite quizalofop (max. 83% AR in water and max. 43% AR in the sediment). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach with Steps 1 and 2 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl, quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop and dihydroxy-quinoxaline. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by quizalofop-P-ethyl and its metabolites quizalofop, hydroxy-quizalofop, and dihydroxy-quinoxaline above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological endpoints for the common metabolites of propaquizafop, quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl were assessed by Member State experts. Where more than one study was available for the same metabolite in the dossiers for propaquizafop, quizalofop-Pethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl, the lower valid endpoint was agreed to be used in all relevant risk assessments. The acute, short-term and long-term risk to birds from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. For mammals, a revised long-term endpoint was agreed for quizalofop-P-ethyl in the meeting of experts. The acute and long-term risk to mammals from quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was assessed as low for the intended uses. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from the common plant metabolites was considered to be low. The risk from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants. The risk from secondary poisoning was assessed as low for the intended uses of both ester variants and for the common metabolites. Both quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl was found to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, based on the lower acute endpoints for algae and fish respectively. The risk from both active substances was assessed as low for the intended uses, based on FOCUS Step 2 PEC calculations. The aquatic risk assessment for metabolites was revised, based on the agreed endpoints for metabolites and PEC values derived from the GAP of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl. Metabolite PEC values from the DAR of quizalofop-P-ethyl were used in the risk assessment, whereas EFSA did calculate new worst case PEC values for quizalofop-P-ethyl metabolites after the peer review. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was assessed as low, based on FOCUS Step 2 and 3 for quizalofop-P-tefuryl and quizalofop-P-ethyl respectively. No risk from bio-accumulation was foreseen for quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-P-tefuryl or any of the metabolites. In the initial assessment for non-target arthropods a potential in-field risk was identified from the use of quizalofop-P-ethyl. Extended laboratory studies were provided for relevant non-target arthropod species. The risk was addressed for all tested species, except for Typhlodromus pyri where the meeting of experts agreed that the in-field risk still needed to be addressed. For the uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl the initial assessment indicated a high risk to T. pyri and Aphidius rhopalosiphi, both in-field and off-field. Extended laboratory studies were provided to address the risk for relevant species. A data gap was, however, agreed in the meeting of experts for the notifier to address the risk to Chrysoperla carnea. The risk assessment for non-target plants from intended uses of quizalofop-Pethyl indicated a need for no-spray buffer zones of 10 m to address the risk to the most sensitive plant species. No valid data were submitted to address the risk to non-target plants from the intended uses of quizalofop-P-tefuryl and a data gap was agreed during the peer review. A study was also required for quizalofop-P-tefuryl to address the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment. An assessment of the risk to biological methods for sewage treatment was provided in the DAR on quizalofop-P-ethyl, indicating a low risk. The risk to bees, earthworms, soil non-target micro-and macro-organisms was assessed as low for the intended uses of quizalofop-P-ethyl and quizalofop-Ptefuryl.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Carbofuran (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-496) Issued on 16 June 2009,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.310r,"Carbofuran is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000(2), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR, Belgium, 2004), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbofuran in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 3 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants FMC Chemical sprl and Dianica S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as laid down in the EFSA conclusion issued on 28 July 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 90). Following the Commission Decision of 13 June 2007 (2007/416/EC)(4) concerning the non-inclusion of carbofuran in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier FMC made a resubmission application for the inclusion of carbofuran in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows: operator, worker and bystander exposure; the risks to birds, mammals, and aquatic organisms; the possible impact on non-target arthropods. Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted the additional report (Belgium, 2008) on carbofuran to the EFSA on 5 January 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA dispatched the additional report to Member States and the notifier for consultation. The comments received were subsequently submitted to the Commission for evaluation. In accordance with Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the Commission subsequently requested the EFSA, by letter received on 18 March 2009, to arrange a peer review of the evaluation, i.e. the additional report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review was initiated on 18 March 2009. The comments received on the additional report were dispatched to the rapporteur Member State for examination. The rapporteur provided a response to the comments in the reporting table, which was subsequently evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues to be further considered in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April/May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in May 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all sections. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide as proposed by the applicants, which comprise incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects where maize, sugar beet and sunflower will be grown, at an application rate of 0.6 kg carbofuran per hectare. Carbofuran can be used as an acaricide, insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as insecticide was evaluated. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as an insecticide as proposed by the applicant, which comprises mechanical incorporation into soil (at drilling) to control soil insects in sugar beet at an application rate of 0.6 kg carbofuran per hectare, applied once every 3 years. It should be noted that the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment of the representative use presented in the additional report, i.e. only the use on sugar beet at an application rate of 0.6 kg carbofuran per hectare. It should also be noted that the proposal by the applicant for a reduced application rate of 60 g a.s./ha was rejected by the rapporteur and was not considered in the peer review. The representative formulated products for the evaluation in the original review were Furadan 5G, a granule (GR) and Diafuran 5G, a microgranule (MG). Both were registered in some Member States of the EU. The representative formulated product for the evaluation under the resubmission was Furadan 5G, a granule (GR) containing 50 g/kg carbofuran. There are methods available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for food of plant and animal origin, environmental matrices, body fluids and tissues, however data gaps were identified for additional validation data for the hydrolysis step of the monitoring methods for plant and animal matrices and for an ILV for the method in plants. Published multi-residue methods allowing determination of all compounds included in the proposed residue definitions in all matrix groups are not available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Carbofuran is rapidly and completely absorbed and excreted in the rat. It is very toxic by ingestion (LD50 7 mg/kg bw) and by inhalation (LC50 0.05 mg/L) whereas toxicity during dermal exposure is moderate (LD50 1000-2000 mg/kg bw). Carbofuran is not a skin irritant, eye irritant, or skin sensitizer, but mortality was reported after exposure to eyes. The proposed classification is T+, R28/R26 ""Very toxic if swallowed and via inhalation"", Xn, R21 ""Harmful in contact with skin"" and T, 39/41 ""Danger of very serious irreversible effects"" and ""Risk for serious damage to eyes"". The critical target is inhibition of brain and erythrocyte (RBC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The overall oral short term no-observed-adverse-effect-level ( NOAEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year dog studies with the NOAELs of 0.1 and 0.25 mg/kg bw/ day, based on RBC AChE inhibition and clinical signs of neurotoxicity and testicular degeneration. It is genotoxic in vitro but negative in in vivo studies. The relevant long term NOAEL is 0.462 mg/kg bw/ day from the rat study. Carbofuran induced decreased body weight in pups as well as pup survival at parental toxic doses. Results from the open literature demonstrated that in utero or lactational exposure to carbofuran during whole gestation or lactation period caused testicular and spermatotoxicity in pups at dose levels of 0.4 mg/kg bw not associated with inducing general toxic effects, these effects were reproduced in a more recent study with dietary administration, however, the effects were far less pronounced and occurred only at systemically toxic doses (18 mg/kg bw/day); they were not reproduced upon gavage administration. Therefore, no classification regarding reproduction toxicity was proposed. At the occasion of the resubmission of carbofuran, new sets of acute neurotoxicity studies were assessed. No NOAEL could be established in pups at post natal day 11 (PND11) based on a significant inhibition of the brain acetylcholinesterase, the low-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was 0.03 mg/kg bw. In young adult rats, the NOAEL was 0.03 mg/kg bw; overall, clinical signs were observed from 0.3 mg/kg bw onwards. The human study (1976) was not considered as scientifically valid. The metabolites 3-hydroxy-carbofuran(5) and 3-keto-carbofuran(6) are very toxic and toxic (LD50 of 8 and 107 mg/kg bw, respectively), the hydroxy metabolite is genotoxic as well in vitro (Ames test and mouse lymphoma cells assay). The metabolites 3-hydroxy-carbofuran-phenol(7), 3-keto-carbofuran-phenol(8) and carbofuran-phenol(9) are harmful if swallowed. The dermal absorption value for the granular formulation, Furadan 5G, is 5 % based on in vivo (default value of 10 %) and in vitro studies (rate of absorption 2x higher in rat than in human skin). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acute reference dose (ARfD) are 0.00015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw in pups from the acute neurotoxicity studies and a safety factor of 200. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.0003 mg/kg bw/day, based on the NOAEL of 0.03 mg/kg bw in young adults from the acute neurotoxicity studies and a safety factor of 100 applied. The estimated operator exposure according to the US PHED (Pesticide Handler's Exposure Database) is below the AOEL i.e. 95 % if personal protective equipment (PPE) as gloves, normal work wear and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) are worn during loading and spreading of the product and assuming an application rate of 0.6 kg carbofuran/ha and a maximum work rate of 10 ha/day. Worker exposure is unlikely to occur, as the formulation is incorporated by mechanical means into the soil when sowing. The granular formulation is applied by ground-directed equipment that is nearly dust free; therefore, the level of bystander exposure to vapour or airborne particles at the time of application is likely to be negligible. The metabolism, distribution and residue behaviour of carbofuran was investigated in various crops and with different methods of application. Moreover, studies with benfuracarb and carbosulfan, of which carbofuran is the main metabolite, were considered applicable to address residue behaviour of carbofuran. Based on all available data the metabolic pathway of carbofuran in soil applied uses can be considered as sufficiently investigated. Carbofuran and 3-OH-carbofuran and their conjugates were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, a need to fully address residues and in particular their identity in succeeding crops was identified. Supervised residue trials in sugar beet, indicated that residues were low and mostly below the LOQ. However, data to demonstrate the analytical method used in the residue trials has efficiently determined conjugated residues is still necessary in order to validate the residue data. In livestock, carbofuran undergoes an extensive metabolisation. 3-OH-carbofuran free and conjugated was considered the relevant residue in animal matrices to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. Further clarification on the ratio of free and conjugated residues in animal matrices was required by the experts in PRAPeR 70 ( data gap). This might be important information to conclude on an animal residue definition for monitoring. For the time being no MRLs can be proposed for plant and animal commodities, because amongst others, the residue definition for monitoring could not be agreed due to outstanding data. The data gaps identified by the meeting PRAPeR 70 do not permit finalisation of the consumer risk assessment. The RMS has provided a comprehensive dietary exposure and risk assessment for consumers using both the EFSA PRIMo and the UK model for a review by the experts, which can be considered being indicative. The sum of intakes of carbofuran and 3-OH carbofuran from the primary crop, rotational crops and food of animal origin was estimated and compared to the toxicological reference values for carbofuran. An exceedance of the ADI was noted for UK toddlers in both models. As agreed by the meeting PRAPeR 70 the risk assessment could be further refined in terms of residues in processed sugar beet. However, the acute consumer risk assessment indicates the ARfD is significantly exceeded for a number of crops, mainly succeeding crops, consumed by children and by adults/the general population. The results highlight the importance of further residue data on succeeding crops to enable refinement of the dietary risk assessment for consumers. To mitigate the identified risk it was suggested to restrict crop rotation to cereals only, but further data and assessment of the proposed scenario will be necessary. Based on the available data no further refinement of the consumer risk assessment is currently possible. EFSA notes that significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected through drinking water derived from groundwater if any restrictions that might be considered to mitigate leaching of residues of carbofuran were not effective. On basis of the laboratory degradation experiments, carbofuran is from low to very high persistent in soil under aerobic conditions. In one of the experiments the metabolite 3-keto-carbofuran exceed the 10 % AR. Carbofuran-phenol reached the 9 % AR at the end of one of the aerobic experiments and the transformation product 3-OH-carbofuran was identified as a minor metabolite in various experiments (max 1.32 % AR). Additionally, the rapporteur Member State included in the list of end points degradation parameters obtained in the studies performed with benfuracarb and carbosulfan. Three experiments resulted in significantly longer DT50 values than the other soil incubations. The EPCO/PRAPeR expert meetings (EPCO 31, September 2005; PRAPeR 62, January 2009 and PRAPeR 67, May 2009) agreed to use these values in the exposure assessment, however the RMS disagreed with the use of these values for the resubmission. Only carbofuran-phenol was identified as major metabolite in the validated anaerobic study. In this anaerobic study carbofuran is low persistent. In the field studies performed with parent carbofuran in USA metabolites 3-OH-carborfuran, 3-keto carbofuran and carbofuran-phenol were analyzed for. Results were only reported as total carbamate for some of the trials and it is not possible to know the exact amount of each metabolite. In other trials, 3-OH-carborfuran is found at levels up to the 3 % of the total residue and 3-keto-carbofuran at levels up to approx. 20 % of the total residue. Carbofuran-phenol is not found above the LOD in any of the trials. Summaries of some field studies performed carbosulfan (EU, reported in the carbosulfan DAR) as parent compound were provided by one applicant. Addendum including the data from these studies has been provided by the rapporteur Member State in April 2006; however the complete assessment of the studies is still missing. Half life of carbofuran in the EU trials (where it appears as metabolite of carbosulfan) ranges between 1.3 to 71.9 d. Half life of carbofuran in the USA sites (where it is applied as parent compound), assessed as relevant for the EU climatic conditions by the rapporteur Member State, ranges between 5 and 121 d. However, only the carbosulfan field studies performed in EU were used by the rapporteur Member State in the risk assessment of carbofuran. The expert meeting EPCO 31 (September 2005) was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. A position paper from the applicants was available (June 2005) but has not been assessed and peer reviewed. The expert meeting EPCO 31 agreed also that it is necessary to determine whether the studies from the USA are acceptable for the EU risk assessment. In the additional report for carbofuran (November 2008) the RMS stated that the field studies performed in the USA were of limited quality, therefore these results were not used in the final risk assessment. Moreover an assessment of the experiment, resulting in a DT50 of 71.9 days, was provided. The RMS conclusion in this assessment was that this experiment is not accepted anymore and for PECsoil calculation the second longest DT50 of 27 days was used from the data set of the EU field studies. Based on the available information, carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil. No information on the degradation rate of metabolites was available in the original DAR, but for the resubmission, laboratory degradation experiments were submitted for the metabolites 3-OH-carbofuran, 3-keto-carbofuran and carbofuran-phenol. Carbofuran-phenol and 3-OH-carbofuran exhibited very low persistence, while 3-keto-carbofuran exhibited very low to low persistence. Carbofuran is classified as very high mobile compound. A data gap was set in 2006 for batch adsorption/desorption studies on carbofuran soil metabolites, which were included in the additional report. 3-OH-carbofuran exhibits very high to high and 3-keto-carbofuran exhibits very high to low mobility in soil, while carbofuran-phenol exhibits medium to low mobility. An aged column leaching study shows that carbofuran and its metabolites (3-keto-carbofuran and carbofuran-phenol) are mobile and may leach under the conditions of the experiments. In aqueous buffer solutions, carbofuran is stable at pH 4 and degrades with half lives of 28 - 45.7 d at pH 7 and 0.1 d at pH 9. Carbofuran-phenol was the major hydrolysis product identified. Photolysis may contribute only slightly to the degradation of carbofuran in water. Carbofuran is not readily biodegradable according the available study. Dissipation of carbofuran in the water sediment was investigated in two studies with a total of three systems. In an acidic system carbofuran degraded in the whole system with a half life of approximately 70 days (normalized to 20 degrees C). Mineralization was low and bound residue reached a maximum level of 32.8 % AR. In the neutral or alkaline systems carbofuran dissipated from the water phase with half lives of 6.9-8.5 days and degraded in the whole system with half lives of 9 - 11.6 d. Carbofuran-phenol was the only major metabolite found in the water-sediment systems. Bound residues reached maximum of 74 - 78 % AR at the end of the study (102 d). These experiments seem to indicate that the degradation of carbofuran may be pH dependent in water sediment systems. Additionally, degradation parameters obtained in the studies performed with benfuracarb and carbosulfan were included in the list of end points. No suitable PECsw and PECsed calculations were available in 2006, but for the resubmission, calculations based on the FOCUS recommendations were performed. FOCUS modelling for estimation PECgw were performed in the original DAR in 2005 and in the additional report (November 2008), however some input parameters used for these simulations were questioned. The simulations were repeated with the agreed parameters (note that most of the FOCUS input parameters for carbofuran were already agreed in January 2009, when benfuracarb was discussed) and the results are included in an addendum. These simulations were accepted by the expert meeting (PRAPeR 67). Parent carbofuran was calculated to be present in leachate leaving the top 1m soil layer at 80th percentile annual average concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in case of 8 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios with the range of 0.19-7.21 mu g/L using the PEARL model, and 7 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios with the range of 0.48- 1.2 mu g/L using the PELMO model, when annual application was simulated. Only the Porto (PEARL) or Porto and Thiva (PELMO) FOCUS scenarios resulted PECgw <0.1 mu g/L (0.037 mu g/L, 0.018 mu g/L and 0.003 mu g/L, respectively). When triennial application was simulated by FOCUS PEARL, 7 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L parametric drinking water limit (0.38-1.26 mu g/L), and again Porto and Thiva FOCUS scenarios resulted PECgw < 0.1 mu g/L (0.018 mu g/L and 0.056 mu g/L, respectively). The PECgw for the metabolites simulated exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L parametric drinking water limit only in a few cases of FOCUS simulations except the annual simulation with PEARL for 3-keto-carbofuran, where 6 out of the 9 results were above the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L. However, it is noted that the simulations for the metabolites were regarded as extreme worst case, as 100 % formation was assumed (which would be expected to be lower in reality). In summary, the potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by carbofuran above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be very high in geo-climatic situations that are represented by 8 out of the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Even at the drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L that is applied to groundwater, consumer exposure would be greater than 10% of the toxicological reference values for vulnerable consumer groups (toddlers and infants). Therefore a drinking water limit < 0.1 mu g/L is needed for carbofuran according to uniform principles. Carbofuran is not expected to be prone to long range transport through the air compartment. A high risk to birds and mammals was identified. The suggested refinements of the risk assessment were not sufficiently supported by data (e.g. PT, PD refinement) or had some shortcomings (e.g. residue trials, lower application rates used in the risk assessment). The experts in the PRAPeR 68 meeting were concerned that the TERs were below the trigger even when the not justified refinements of PD and PT values were included in the TER calculation. The experts expressed their doubts that a safe use could be demonstrated even with further refinement of the risk assessment. The TERs were below the trigger of 100 and 10 for aquatic invertebrates with FOCUS step3 PECsw for the application rate of 600 g a.s./ha for the drainage scenarios (D3, D4). The exposure of the aquatic environment was negligible for the FOCUS run-off scenarios (R1, R3). The TERs for carbofuran were below the trigger of 100 and 10 for aquatic invertebrates with FOCUS step3 PECsw for the application rate of 600 g a.s./ha. Therefore the aquatic risk assessment needs further refinement. A high risk was indicated in extended laboratory studies and semi-field tests with non-target arthropods. A field study was submitted where recovery was observed. However, the study was conducted at an application rate of 375 g a.s./ha which was too low to cover the intended rate of 600 g a.s./ha. The long-term TERs were below the trigger of 5 for earthworms. A field study with the formulation Marshall 25 CS (a.s. carbosulfan) was suggested to address the long-term risk to earthworms. Uncertainties remain whether the exposure from in-furrow application (high concentrations locally) would lead to higher risk than even distribution of the active substance. A high risk was indicated in the first-tier risk assessment for soil non-target macro-organisms. Recovery was observed also for soil dwelling arthropods in the above mentioned field study. Since the application rate was too low the risk to soil dwelling non-target macro organisms was considered not sufficiently addressed. The risk to bees, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluopicolide (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-309) Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.299r,"Fluopicolide is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 the United Kingdom received an application from Bayer for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2005/778/EC3. Following the agreement with the EU-Commission EFSA will organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after 30 June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State the United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on fluopicolide, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 12 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 11 January 2006 by dispatching the draft assessment report for consultation to the Member States and the notifier. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in a written procedure in March 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November / December 2007 and in January 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States in a written procedure in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier which comprise foliar spraying to vine grapes against downy mildew and to potatoes against late blight. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were, 'AE F053616 06 WG71 A1'. or, 'EXP 11074B', a water dispersible granule (WG), containing 44.4 g/kg fluopicolide and 666.7 g/kg fosetyl-aluminium and, 'AE B066752 04 SC61 A1'. or, 'EXP 11120A', a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 62.5 g/L fluopicolide and 625 g/L propamocarb hydrochloride. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices. Since fluopicolide is not classified as acute toxic or very toxic, analytical methods for the determination of residues of fluopicolide in body fluids and/or tissues are not required. In the mammalian metabolism studies, fluopicolide was moderately rapidly but incompletely absorbed orally (approximately 62 %) and widely distributed. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation, fluopicolide was extensively metabolised and rapidly excreted mainly via faeces. The acute toxicity of fluopicolide in rats was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route, no skin irritation and only slight irritation to the eyes were observed. Fluopicolide did not exhibit skin sensitisation potential. The liver was the main target organ of fluopicolide in short-term tests in rats, mice and dogs. A sub-acute NOAEL of 17.7 mg/kg bw/day was based on the 28-day rat study. The relevant short term NOAEL was 7.4 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dietary study in rat, based on haematological changes, clinical signs, liver and kidney toxicity at the next higher dose level of 109 mg/kg bw/day. As indicated in a mechanistic study, fluopicolide appears to be a phenobarbital-like inducer of liver enzymes. It is unlikely that fluopicolide presents a genotoxic hazard to humans. In a chronic rat study, effects on liver and kidneys were observed, but no tumour induction was found. Similarly, in a chronic study with mice, liver toxicity was observed. The increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas seen at high dose was considered not relevant for human risk assessment based on mechanistic considerations. Accordingly, no classification for carcinogenicity was proposed. The relevant long term NOAEL was based on the mice study with a NOAEL of 7.9 mg/kg bw/day, which was supported by the rat NOAEL of 8.4 mg/kg bw/day. In a two-generation study no effect on reproduction or fertility was seen. Premature delivery, effects on body weight (dams and pups) and reduced crown-rump lengths at maternally toxic doses were observed in developmental studies in rats and rabbits; the relevant developmental NOAEL was the dose level of 20 mg/kg bw/ day from the rabbit study. A series of fluopicolide metabolites were assessed for their toxicological relevance with the aid of toxicological studies conducted with M01(4), M02(5), M04(6), M05(7), M10(8) and M14(9). Plant metabolites M04, M05, M08(10) and M09(11), were considered less toxic than the parent. The M01 metabolite may be considered of comparable toxicity as the parent, although slightly more acutely toxic. In principle, the ADI of the parent could have been applied, however, as an acceptable set of studies were conducted with M01 and considering that M01 is also a metabolite of another active substance, an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.05 mg/kg bw/day was set for this metabolite as well as an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.3 mg/kg bw. The metabolites M01, M03(12), M05, M10, M11(13), M12(14), M13(15) and M14 were not considered relevant according to the guidance document on groundwater metabolites(16) even if they appear at levels above 0.1 mu g/L in groundwater, however information is lacking on the metabolite M15(17), which was not peer-reviewed. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of fluopicolide was set at 0.08 mg/kg bw/day derived from the 78-week dietary study in mice and supported by the 2-year study in rats; a safety factor of 100 was applied. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was set at 0.05 mg/kg bw/day, derived from the 90-day rat study, corrected for limited oral absorption of 62 % and applying a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) was set at 0.18 mg/kg bw, derived from the 28-day dietary rat study and the rabbit developmental study, applying a safety factor of 100. For both representative preparations, the dermal absorption values were agreed at 0.24 % for the concentrate and 2.75 % for the in-use spray dilution. Considering only the fluopicolide component of these formulations, the level of operator exposure estimated at a maximum dose rate of 0.133 kg fluopicolide/ha in grapevines and 0.1 kg fluopicolide/ha in potatoes was below the AOEL for all scenarios proposed when gloves were used during mixing/loading and application and even when no personal protective equipment (PPE) was considered according to the German model and EUROPOEM. Estimated exposures for unprotected re-entry workers and bystanders were below the AOEL for both fluopicolide representative formulations. Metabolism of fluopicolide was investigated in grapes, potatoes and lettuce. Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides fluopicolide, its metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-06 were identified. With the exception of M-01 for which an ADI and an ARfD was set by the toxicology section, the metabolites were regarded as less toxic than the parent and/ or were also found in the rat metabolism studies. It was decided to include M-01 in the residue definition for risk assessment for plant matrices. As the metabolite M-01 is not unique to fluopicolide it was not included in the residue definition for monitoring. A sufficient number of residue trials on grapes and potatoes supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose MRLs for these crops. Metabolism in rotational crops was found to be similar, but more extensive as in primary crops. Additionally identified metabolites were M-04, M-05, M-08 and M-09. On the basis of the results of field studies on rotational crops, no quantifiable levels of fluopicolide are expected in consumable crop parts. Metabolism studies on lactating diary and laying hens showed a low transfer into tissues, milk and eggs. Metabolism was extensive, mainly by hydroxylation followed by conjugation. The only hydrolysis product identified was metabolite M-01, which was included in the residue definition for risk assessment because of its toxicological potential. Dietary burden calculations showed only significant intake of fluopicolide residues for cattle. On the basis of available feeding studies on lactating cows, no quantifiable residues are expected in products of bovine. Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment with fluopicolide according to the notified GAPs. The level of 0.75 mu g/L is expected to be exceeded in groundwater by metabolites M-01, M-05, M-10 and M-11. A consumer risk assessment for the consumption of drinking water for these metabolites showed that an exceedance of the relevant reference values is not expected after chronic or acute intake of fluopicolide through drinking water. Fluopicolide is of high to very high persistence in soil (DT50 (lab) (20) (degrees C) = 194 d - 411 d) under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. In soil fluopicolide forms the metabolite M-03. This compound breaks down to M-01 and M-02. The metabolite M- 03 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 2.2 - 5.0 d) in soils at acidic pH and of very low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C < 5h) in soils at neutral or slightly alkaline pH and may be considered an intermediate in the formation of M-01 and M-02. M- 01 is of very high persistence in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 557 - 1831 d) and M- 02 is of low persistence (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 3.2 - 4.6 d). No other metabolites were detected in significant amounts in the laboratory soil studies. Extent of degradation in sterilized and non sterilized samples was in the same range, indicating little contribution of microbiological degradation. M-01 was shown to be very stable in the two soils where it was investigated. Degradation of M-02 produced an extensive number of pyridine derivatives. Some of them were identified and characterized: M-10, M-05, M-14, M-11/12 and M-13. M-05 and M-10 are moderate to high persistent (M-05: DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 31 - 130 d; M- 10: 22 - 253 d), M-14 is low persistent in soil (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 5- 8 d). RMS considered that values obtained for half lives metabolites M-11/12 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 38.5 - 86.1 d), M-13 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 10.3 - 43.0 d), and M-10 (DT50 lab 20 degrees C = 4.5 - 307 d) were not robust due to low and variable levels of these metabolites but acceptable to be used in groundwater modelling. Fluopicolide was very stable under dark anaerobic conditions and only metabolites M- 01 and M- 02 were identified at minor amounts. Photolysis degradation occurs to some extend but no new metabolites are identified in the available studies. On the absence of further data, the meeting considered that photolysis may contribute to some extend to the degradation of fluopicolide under natural conditions in EU and that the applicant should update their estimate of photolytic half life at 40 - 45 degrees N latitude. Dissipation of fluopicolide under field conditions has been investigated in a number of field dissipation studies in Germany (3 studies, 3 sites), Spain, Southern France and Northern France. One of the studies performed in Germany and the studies performed in France were prolonged over some seasons to investigate the potential for accumulation of fluopicolide residues. Dissipation in most of the cases was better described by a biphasic model. Three soil dissipation and accumulation studies were conducted by the applicant in Germany (one site, 5 years), Northern France (one site, 4 years) and Southern France (one site, 4 years). The expert meeting agreed with the RMS and confirmed the initial evaluation that indicates that the plateau has not been reached in some of the studies. For PEC soil calculations, the PRAPeR 37 expert meeting agreed using a SFO DT50 = 290 d for fluopicolide and a SFO DT50 = 315 d for M01 since they result in DT90 corresponding approximately to the worst case observed in the field studies. Potential for accumulation of fluopicolide and the metabolite M- 01 was confirmed by the PEC soil calculation (plateau are reached for the parent after 7 years in potatoes and after 9 years in vines and for the metabolite M-01 after 5 years in potatoes and 6 years in vines). Fluopicolide exhibits medium mobility in soil (K-Foc = 172 - 580 mL/g). M-01 and M-02 are very high mobile in soil (M-01: K-Foc = 31 - 51 mL / g; M-02: K-Foc = 1.1 - 10.5 mL / g). The metabolite M-03 is high mobile in acidic soil (K-Foc = 82 - 133 mL / g). Finally the metabolites M-05 and M-10 are very high mobile in soil (M-05: K-Foc = 11 - 49 mL / g; M-10: K-Foc = 0 - 10.66 mL / g). A three years lysimeter study was performed in Germany. Due to the fact that fluopicoline was only labelled at the pyridine ring, no information on the potential leaching of M-01 was obtained from these experiments. A number of metabolites not previously identified in the laboratory degradation in soil studies were identified in the leachate of these lysimeter studies: M-05 (max. annual average concentration = 0.9 mu g / L), M-10 (max. annual average concentration = 0.83 mu g / L), M-11/12 (max. annual average concentration = 0.55/0.36 mu g / L), M-13 (max. annual average concentration = 0.14 mu g / L), M-14 (max. annual average concentration = 0.19 mu g / L), M-15 (max. annual average concentration = 0.095 mu g / L), M- 16 (max. annual average concentration = 0.08 mu g / L), M54 (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.03 mu g / L), P6A (max. annual average concentration = 0.07 mu g / L), M3 (max. annual average concentration = 0.04 mu g / L) and M29 (max. annual average concentration = 0.09 mu g / L)(18). The mobility of the lysimeter metabolites M- 14, M-11/12 and M-13 was assessed with the HPLC method. All these metabolites are very high mobile. Due to the high polarity of M11/12 and M13, the results obtained were considered meaningless and a K-oc = 0 was assumed for the risk assessment. For M-14 was possible to estimate acceptable soil sorption parameters (K-oc = 19.2 mL / g). A field leaching study in South West Germany is also available. Metabolite M-01 reached annual average concentrations up to 2.93 mu g / L at 120 cm depth on the third year after application. Fluopicolide and its metabolite M-01 may be considered stable to hydrolysis under most relevant environmental conditions. Hydrolysis M-03 was pH dependent with half lives between 45.5 h (pH 5.1) to 9 min (pH 8.1). Aqueous photolysis is unlikely to be a significant route of degradation of fluopicolide in the natural aqueous environment. Fluopicolide and M-01 compounds should be considered not readily biodegradable. Degradation of fluopicolide in the water sediment systems was very limited. RMS calculated whole systems half lives for fluopicolide in both systems (DT50 (whole system) = 873 - 1428 d). During the experiment, fluopicolide was partitioned to the sediment. At the equilibrium about 10 to 40 % AR remained as parent fluopicolide in the water phase. Only M-01 and M-02 were identified as degradation metabolites at low levels. PECSW / SED values were calculated by means of FOCUS SW. FOCUS Step 1-2 were calculated for fluopicolide and metabolites M-01, M-02 and M-03. FOCUS SW Step 3 values were also calculated for fluopicolide. The potential of ground water contamination by fluopicolide and the metabolites M-03, M-01, M-02, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-14 and M-13 was assessed in the original dossier for the use in vines and potatoes with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. Further modelling with FOCUS PEARL has become available during the peer review. Fluopicolide and its metabolites M-03, M-01, M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12 and M-13 may exceed the limit of 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for at least one of the scenarios simulated. The metabolite M-01 also exceeded the limit of 0.75 mu g / L in a number of scenarios. For the use in vines fluopicolide exceeds 0.1 mu g / L annual average concentration at 1 m depth for more than half of the scenarios simulated. In the lysimeter study, where potatoes were planted, annual average concentration of metabolites M-05, M-10, M-11, M-12, M-13 and M-15 at 1 m depth exceed the 0.1 mu g / L trigger, in the case of M-05 and M-10 also the trigger of 0.75 mu g / L was exceeded in at least one of the lysimeters in oneout of of the three years the experiment was performed. In the field leaching study metabolite M-01 reached an annual average concentration of 2.9 mu g / L in the leachate at 120 cm depth the third year after the product was applied. Since half life in the atmosphere is longer than 2 d and fluopicolide is sprayed, formation of aerosols and long range transport trough the atmosphere cannot be excluded. It was concluded that the risk for birds and mammals was assessed as low for both evaluated uses, except for the long-term risk for mammals for the use in vines. Risk mitigation measures should be required at Member Stated level. The risk from secondary poisoning and from consumption of contaminated drinking water was assessed to be low for birds and mammals. A potential high risk was identified for the aquatic organism for both evaluated uses, therefore risk mitigation measures were required. The risk for bioaccumulation in fish from fluopicolide is considered to be low. The risk for the relevant metabolites to aquatic organism was assessed as low. The risk for bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organism, non-target plants and biological methods for swage treatments, was assessed to be low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clofentezine Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.269r,"Clofentezine is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). Clofentezine was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on clofentezine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 August 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan International Coordination Centre. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in August-September 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2009. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as acaricide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in pome fruit, stone fruit, grapes, strawberries and ornamentals for the control of mites. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Apollo 50 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 500 g/L clofentezine, registered under different trade names in Europe. The minimum purity of clofentezine technical could not be concluded on, as the original manufacturing site was no longer in use, and the data on the new source could not be considered in the peer review. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor clofentezine residues in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices, however a data gap was identified for a confirmatory method for determination of clofentezine in commodities with high water content. Furthermore, pending on the final residue definition for products of animal origin, a data gap was identified for a fully validated method for the determination of the compounds in the residue definition. In mammals, clofentezine is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalational toxicity; it is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. The main toxicological effect after repeated oral administration to mice, rats, and dogs was liver enlargement. The relevant short-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 2.65 mg/kg bw/day in rats, 151.4 mg/kg bw/day in mice and 1.7 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, whereas the relevant long-term NOAELs in rats and mice are 2 mg/kg bw/day and 5 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Clofentezine does not have a genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. Clofentezine does not affect fertility or reproductive performance. Relevant maternal and offspring NOAELs are 4 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased liver weight and reduced body weight in parents and decreased pup weight in offspring, whereas the relevant reproductive toxicity NOAEL is 27.8 mg/kg bw/day. Clofentezine does not show any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits: the relevant maternal NOAELs are 250 mg/kg bw/day (rabbit) and 320 mg/kg bw/day (rat), whereas the developmental NOAELs are 1000 mg/kg bw/day and 3200 mg/kg bw/day, in rabbits and rats, respectively. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.02 mg/kg bw/day was based on the long-term toxicity NOAEL from the 2-year rat study, with a safety factor of 100. The overall toxicological picture of clofentezine did not justify setting an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was based on the NOAEL from the 90-day study in rat, with a safety factor of 100 and corrected by 50 % oral absorption. In all scenarios proposed for the operator applying 'Apollo 50 SC' exposure levels are below the AOEL (mainly with the use of personal protective equipment - PPE) as well as for bystanders; worker exposure estimates shows levels below the AOEL, except for re-entry in treated pome and stone fruit crops (107 % of the AOEL, no PPE considered). The metabolism of clofentezine has been investigated in the fruit plant group only, on apple, lemon, peach and grape. The parent clofentezine was shown to be the major compound accounting for 55 % to 87 % of the total radioactive residue (TRR). The metabolic pathway runs through the cleavage of the tetrazine ring to form 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666), which is further oxidised to 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117), 2-chlorobenzyl alcohol and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). This degradation pathway is specific to plants, since no metabolites resulting from the cleavage of the parent compound were found in rat metabolism. Based on these studies, the plant residue definition for monitoring was limited to the parent clofentezine only. However, for risk assessment, the experts were of the opinion to include the metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) in the residue definition, awaiting additional information on its toxicity and its toxicological relevance. The residue trials were sufficient to propose an MRL for strawberries grown outdoor. For the other crops, the residue database was considered not relevant and incomplete, as the residue trials were mainly performed with application rates in excess of 50 % to the representative GAPs. A new residue data set in compliance with the critical GAPs was requested for plums, grapes and apples. Clofentezine residues were shown to be stable over 2 years in high water containing matrices. In a standard hydrolytic study, clofentezine was totally degraded at 120 degrees C to form the metabolites hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) 3, 2-chlorobenzamide (AE F092117) and 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666). These metabolites are not covered by the rodent metabolism, and no information was provided on their toxicological relevance and their possible residue levels in the processed fractions. Therefore, no residue definition was proposed, and a new processing data set taking into account the parent clofentezine and its breakdown metabolites was requested in addition to clarification concerning their toxicity and their residue levels in the processed fractions. Transfer factors (TF) taking into account the parent clofentezine only were proposed for apple juice, apple wet and dry pomace, apple sauce, pasteurised canned strawberries and raisin. Transfer in grape juice and wine was identified as a data gap. No standard rotational crop study was submitted, but considering the DT90 value up to 640 days in the aerobic field studies and the fact that outdoor strawberry crops may be rotated, the EFSA is of the opinion that a standard rotational crop study has to be requested. The discussion concerning the metabolism of clofentezine in animals was not conclusive. No residue definition was proposed, even if there was clear evidence that the residue definition for animal products should at least include the parent clofentezine and the metabolite 4-hydroxy-clofentezine(4). Moreover, considering that the dietary intake by animals is mainly based on a processed commodity (apple pomace), it was concluded that information on the nature of the residues in the processed feed is needed prior to propose a reliable residue definition for animal products. Nevertheless, and considering the residues resulting from the representative uses, no residues above the LOQ (limit of quantification) are expected in animal matrices and there is no need to set a residue definition for animal products at the moment. Using to the EFSA PRIMo rev2 model, the MRL of 2.0 mg/kg is proposed for strawberries, the highest TMDI (theoretical maximum daily intake) is 7 % of the ADI. According to the available studies, clofentezine is moderate to high persistent in soil (DT50 = 16.8 - 109 days) under dark aerobic conditions. Under these conditions clofentezine yields two major metabolites: hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 13 % AR after 30 days in one soil) and 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) (maximum of 13.6 % based on theoretical molar basis). The rapporteur Member State calculated the half-life of the metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) based on data in one soil (Cottenham) (DT50 = 43 days). This value was derived from the decline phase of the metabolite, ignoring the concomitant formation. The assessment presented by the rapporteur Member State may be regarded as a conservative estimate, since this half-life is used associated to a formation fraction of 1. A data gap for two additional half-lives has been identified in order to complete the minimum data set required. This data gap is not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, however, the data may be needed by Member States when evaluating other potential uses of clofentezine. An additional data gap was identified for ground water and surface water exposure assessments for the metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233). Bound residue comprised up to 32.3 % AR and CO2 up to 40.7 % AR after 120 days. The degradation seems to be enhanced under anaerobic conditions, with higher levels of bound residue (43.5 % AR after 90 days) and lower levels of CO2 (19 % AR after 90 days), than under aerobic conditions. However, no major metabolites were observed under the anaerobic test conditions. Photolysis may contribute to the degradation of clofentezine in the environment. The only metabolite identified was 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) that reached a maximum of 5.5 % AR at the end of the study (30 days). This metabolite should be assessed for potential ground water contamination. Field soil dissipation trials from different locations of Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy are available and summarized in the DAR. Maximum plateau residue of 16 - 26 % of the initial applied concentration (on molar basis) of clofentezine was calculated to be reached after 3-5 years. No batch soil adsorption/desorption studies are available for clofentezine because of the low solubility (3 mu g/L). According to an estimation (based on the octanol/water partition coefficient) clofentezine was considered to be low mobile in soil (K-oc = 1064 mL/g). The result was confirmed by available soil column leaching-and soil TLC (thin layer chromatography) experiments. A batch soil adsorption/desorption study was conducted with the soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) in three soils. This metabolite showed low mobility in soil (K-foc = 742 - 1084 mL/g). A possible pH-dependence was indicated by this study with lower sorption at higher pH. The hydrolysis of clofentezine was pH-dependent (pH 5: DT50 = 10.4 days; pH 7: DT50 = 26.4 hours - 34.4 hours; pH 9: DT50 = 4.3 hours at 22 degrees C). The main hydrolysis product was hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) (maximum of 45 % AR at pH 9 and 22 degrees C), that was further degraded to the minor metabolites 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) and 2- chlorobenzamide (AE F092117). According to the information available, photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of clofentezine. A major aqueous photolysis metabolite was identified: 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666; maximum of 79 % AR). The meeting of experts concluded that this metabolite needs to be assessed for its fate and effects on the aquatic environment. Clofentezine is not readily biodegradable. The degradation of clofentezine was investigated in one study in two water sediment systems. Clofentezine dissipated from the water phase via either partition to the sediment or degradation to metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600). Clofentezine whole system half-lives of 7.1 days - 13.1 days were observed. The Step 4 FOCUS PECSW used in the risk assessment presented in the DAR were considered not appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The PRAPeR 63 meeting of experts on ecotoxicology did not agree with the acceptable concentration proposed by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 2. With the agreed ecotoxicological end point, mitigation would be needed to demonstrate an acceptable use with respect to the aquatic environment. No new Step 4 FOCUS PECSW calculations are available, and therefore the aquatic risk assessment remains open. It should be noted that the ecotoxicological end point is also pending on the evaluation of a study that cannot be considered at this stage in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. The meeting of experts agreed that PECSW/SED values for the aqueous photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile (AE F023666) are needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. No new calculations have been performed after the meeting of experts. The rapporteur Member State proposed in the list of end points to use the FOCUS Step 1 PECSW, calculated for the parent compound as a worst case surrogate for this metabolite in the EU risk assessment. The potential ground water contamination by clofentezine and its soil metabolite hydrazide-hydrazone (AE C593600, FBC 93600) was assessed for the representative uses in apples (fruit/stone fruit), grapevines and strawberries. The calculated concentrations were all below 0.001 mu g/L. Whereas the EFSA Opinion on FOCUS GW models(5) requires that the calculations should be done with an additional model, it is not likely that in this case the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L would be breached. During the peer review the need to assess the potential ground water contamination by the soil aerobic metabolite 2-chlorobenzoic acid (AE C500233, NC233) and the soil photolysis metabolite 2-chlorobenzonitrile ( AE F023666) was identified. Therefore, new data gaps have been identified for the corresponding studies and calculations. Clofentezine may be considered slightly volatile. On the basis of the estimated atmospheric half-life of 5.1 days clofentezine would be considered relatively stable in air. The experts agreed that even when the volatilization from water and soil and plant surfaces is expected to be low, long-range transport in the atmosphere may occur due to the formation of aerosols when the substance is sprayed. The acute and short-term dietary risk to birds was low, but a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded for the uses in pome/stone fruit, vineyards, strawberries and ornamentals. The risk to mammals was assessed as low for all representative uses. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low except for the long-term risk to fish. No full FOCUS Step 3 scenario resulted in a TER greater than 10. However, the long-term risk assessment for fish was based on a NOEC value from an early life stage study where only one concentration was tested. A new study was made available where more concentrations were tested. The new study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 and should be considered at Member State level. The in-field hazard quotient (HQ) value was <2 for Typhlodromus pyri but not for Aphidius rhopalosiphi. No effects of >50 % were observed in standard laboratory studies with Trichogramma cacoeciae, Chrysoperla carnea, Phytoselius persimilis and Poecilus cupreus. Concerns remained with regard to the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The applicant submitted new studies to address the risk to sensitive life stages of non-target arthropods. The studies were evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but were not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. A litter bag study was triggered but not included in the original dossier. A litter bag study was submitted by the applicant and evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in Addendum 1, but the study was not taken into account in the peer review in view of the restrictions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. The risk to bees, earthworms, collembola, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance myclobutanil (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-00606) Issued on 4 June 2009,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.298r,"Myclobutanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.(2) This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on myclobutanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October - November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises air assisted broadcast spraying to table and wine grapes and apples in the fruit development stage, against powdery mildew, black rot and scab, in Northern and Southern Europe, up to a maximum 4 applications at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 48 g a.s./ha on grapes, and 90 g a.s./ha on apples, with an interval of 10 days between applications. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, 'Systhane 20 EW', an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 200 g/L myclobutanil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method. In mammals, myclobutanil LD50 is 1600 mg/kg bw ( classification as R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" is proposed). It is not toxic via dermal and inhalation routes (LD50 >2000 mg/kg bw and LC50>5.1 mg/L). Myclobutanil is not a skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. The European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) classified myclobutanil with R36 (""Irritating to eyes""). The primary target organ following exposure to myclobutanil is the liver. Myclobutanil induces liver enlargement accompanied by slight induction of biotransformation enzymes (in rats and mice). An overall subchronic NOAEL of 100 ppm was proposed (3.09 mg/kg bw/day). Myclobutanil does not show any genotoxic potential. In long-term studies in rat, the target organ appeared to be the testes (bilateral testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis). The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Myclobutanil did not show any carcinogenic potential. In a two-generation rat study, myclobutanil, at a dietary concentration of 1000 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day) produced reduced parental body weight and liver effects and decreased weight gain in pups during lactation; at slight parental toxic doses the number of females delivering litters was reduced and the incidence of stillborn pups increased. The relevant parental, offspring and reproductive NOAEL is 16 mg/kg bw/day. Myclobutanil is already classified as Repr. Cat 3, R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child""). The relevant parental NOAEL is 94 mg/kg bw/day, while the relevant developmental NOAEL is 31 mg/kg bw/day. No indication of any other neurological effects was found in the toxicological studies. The proposed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is based on the relevant NOAEL from the long-term rat study, applying a safety factor of 100, giving an ADI of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day was agreed to be based on the overall NOAEL (90-day and 1-year in dog) of 3.09 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The rat developmental toxicity study was considered as the most appropriate to use for setting the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). An NOAEL of 31.3 mg/kg bw/day was established due to embryotoxic effects (altered viability index). Based on this NOAEL and an assessment factor of 100 the proposed ARfD is 0.31 mg/kg bw. There is a 300-fold margin between the proposed ARfD and the LOAEL for developmental effects in the rat developmental toxicity study. The operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL even when no PPE is worn (German model). The metabolism of myclobutanil was investigated in grapes, apples (representative uses) and additionally in wheat. In grapes and apples at harvest, the major components of the residue were myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090(3) in free and conjugated form. A metabolic cleavage of the myclobutanil molecule which would generate triazole derivative metabolites was - in contrast to the wheat study - not observed in apples and grapes. Based on the available plant metabolism data for the categories fruit and cereals it was concluded that the metabolism is not comparable amongst different crop groups. As for the representative uses, however, it was agreed that the relevant residue for the category fruit crops should be defined as myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 (free and conjugated). A sufficient number of residue trials in apples and grapes are available; however, there is still evidence required that the submitted trials cover the proposed residue definition. In processing studies it was investigated how the residue levels of myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 change when apples and grapes are processed to juice, wine, puree etc. However, a study investigating the effects of processing on the nature of the residues was identified as necessary since under processing conditions significant amounts of one or more degradation products, initially not present in the raw commodities, could be generated. The investigation of residues in rotational and succeeding crops was considered not relevant since both apples and grapes are perennial crops that are usually not grown in rotation with other crops. However it was highlighted that in the long term the issue of potential uptake of triazole derivative metabolites could become relevant and should be followed up separately as this concern is not specific to the active substance myclobutanil alone but common to a number of triazole pesticides. Since significant exposure of livestock to residues in feed may occur, a metabolism study in ruminants was triggered. The majority of the experts agreed that the level of identification was insufficient in the available study and thus a robust residue definition for food of animal origin could not be concluded on. Consequently, the relevance of the available feeding study for the assessment and likely necessary MRL proposals for food of animal origin can only be decided on when a residue definition has been concluded. As a consequence of the identified data gaps, the consumer risk assessment with regard to the notified representative uses on apples and grapes cannot be finalised. Moreover, the risk assessment with regard to the two isomers of myclobutanil was not addressed. It is noted that in addition to exposure from residues in food, the consumer could be exposed to residues of myclobutanil butyric acid, 4 a potential metabolite from ground water used as drinking water, but currently an assessment of the relevance of the metabolite and consequently of consumer risk is not available. An additional exposure to myclobutanil residues from groundwater used as drinking water can also not be excluded. In soil under aerobic conditions myclobutanil exhibits high to very high persistence, forming the minor soil metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid (accounting for a maximum of 6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was limited and accounted for only 0.2 to 1.7% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4 to 16% AR after 120 days. Myclobutanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, myclobutanil butyric acid exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either myclobutanil or myclobutanil butyric acid was affected significantly by differing soil pH. Data on degradation in soil under anaerobic conditions are not available and it was considered they will be necessary to support the applied for use on apples in some territories of the EU. In dark natural sediment water systems myclobutanil partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.3% AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented only 4.3 to 9.8% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for myclobutanil at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. On the basis of the available reliable information, it cannot be excluded that for the applied for intended uses, groundwater exposure by myclobutanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, will not occur over a wide range of European geoclimatic conditions. In addition for the metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid, groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit might be expected and it cannot be excluded that concentrations > 0.75 mu g/L (a key assessment trigger from the groundwater metabolite relevance guidance document) may occur. A groundwater metabolite non relevance assessment is therefore necessary for myclobutanil butyric acid but this assessment is not available. The risk to birds and mammals was assessed as low except the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals from the use in apple orchards. A refined risk assessment applying interception factors of 65% and 70% resulted in a TER of 5.18 which is above the Annex VI trigger of 5. The risk of secondary poisoning from uptake of contaminated earthworms was assessed as low. A data gap was identified in the experts. meeting for the submission of a risk assessment for fish-eating birds and mammals since it was not possible to exclude that the logP(ow) of myclobunatil is >3. Myclobutanil is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The TERs based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw were above the Annex VI triggers for the representative use on grapes. For the use in apple orchards risk mitigation measures such as a no-spray buffer zone of 14 metres is required to achieve TERs above the Annex VI triggers. The assessment of the logPow value was inconclusive. In the expert meeting a data gap for a bioconcentration study with fish was identified since four applications are foreseen and chronic and repeated exposure of fish is expected. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. It was identified that the risk assessment did not address the potential for different myclobutanil isomer ratios to be present in the environment.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide Issued on 30 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.193r,"Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The specification for the technical material as a whole should currently be regarded as provisional (September 2008). The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Raxil S FS 040"", a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS) containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant and animal origin, soil and water, however for air, a method validated to LOQ of 0.6 mu g a.s./m(3) is required. With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed but only partly bioavailable (50%) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure, it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed. After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver and kidneys. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 (Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed) could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation was proposed. Triazoxide did not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies. No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 May cause harm to breastfed babies was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation, that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats and rabbits. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI) was 0.00005 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 10. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the shallow dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The agreed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) was 0.001 mg/kg bw/ day based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50%). The agreed acute reference dose (ARfD) was 0.015 mg/kg bw based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100. The agreed dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment were 2.4% for the concentrate and 2% for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimate during the seed treatment was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies showed an exposure level up to 21% of the AOEL. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed was above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL with a field study (26%). With regard to consumer exposure assessment, the nature and magnitude of residues in plant and animal commodities could not be sufficiently clarified by the submitted data on triazoxide applied as a seed treatment to barley. Taking into account the toxicological profile of triazoxide and its metabolites, the meeting of experts in residues agreed on data gaps with regard to the nature of residues in the plant. No final residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment could therefore be agreed. In the submitted residue trials no residues of triazoxide were found above the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw. However, it was agreed that the analytical method used in these trials was not validated at a sufficiently low LOQ to ensure that an exceedance of the ADI could be definitively excluded, and therefore new trials with a lower LOQ were required. Assuming residues of triazoxide were present in barley grain at the LOQ level of 0.05 mg/kg, the ADI was exceeded for one Member State diet in the EFSA PRAPeR model. The potential for residues being present in food of animal origin due to carry-over from treated straw has not been addressed, since no data on livestock was submitted due to residues being below the LOQ of 0.05 mg/kg in grain and straw in residue trials. However, given the very low ADI of triazoxide and its metabolites, and given the presence of total residues of 0.04 mg/kg in straw, the experts had concerns that transfer of toxicologically relevant residues from straw into livestock matrices may occur, even though at very low levels. An indicative exposure assessment, using the default residue value of 0.01 mg/kg for milk, showed that the ADI would be significantly exceeded for a number of European national and regional diets, and therefore further consideration of the issue of residues in animal products is required. No concerns were identified with regard to residues in rotational crops, provided rotated cereals will be addressed with the required new data for the primary cereal crop. In conclusion, the available metabolism and residue data are not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer exposure and risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities, and with regard to possible transfer of residues in animal products, and the need for a lower LOQ of the analytical method for the relevant analytes in studies on the magnitude of residues. Triazoxide may be considered to be high to very high persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab (biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). Degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to desoxy-triazoxide (M01)(2), or through production of triazoxide-amine (M02)(3). Assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicate that M01 was moderate persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and M02 could be considered high to very high persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed). A kinetic assessment of laboratory data allowed the applicant to derive kinetic half-lives for M01, that are associated with a formation fraction of 1. Unextracted residues amounted up to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested. Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation. Field studies are available, with some of them including measurements of the soil metabolites. Kinetic analysis of the field data presented by the applicant was discussed by the meeting of experts. The kinetic analysis was not fully accepted, and the need of considering formation fractions of 1 for further modelling based on this analysis was agreed. Analysis of the data based on the decline of M02 has been performed by the RMS, and the resulting half-lives (decline M02 DissT(50) (field) = 239 - 447 days; excluding UK field trial where no decline is observed) may be used in conjunction with the maximum observed of 18.7 % for exposure risk assessment. PECs soil presented in the DAR were calculated by the RMS for triazoxide and its soil major metabolites following standard procedures. Updated PECs soil with parameters agreed by the meeting of experts are reported in addendum 2 and do not result in a change of the risk assessment already performed. According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL/g), desoxy-triazoxide (M01) may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 4148 mL/g), and triazoxide-amine (M02) may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL/g). The RMS noted the narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite triazoxide-amine (M02). Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use proposed, further data could be needed if other uses at significant higher application rates are applied for in the future. Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was triazoxide-oxone (M04)(4). Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicates that photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N). No ready biodegradability study is available, and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable. In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and triazoxide-desoxyamino (M05)(5). Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and desoxy-triazoxide in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated by the RMS (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and triazoxide-desoxy, respectively, based on results of Lienden system. Input parameters to be used for FOCUS PECSW were discussed and agreed in the meeting of experts. After the meeting, the RMS has presented an addendum with new FOCUS SW (Step 1 and Step 2) for metabolite M01 and M02 following the approach agreed by the meeting. However, the new PECs calculated do not alter the outcome of the risk assessment already presented by the RMS in the DAR. Three different approaches based on FOCUS GW to calculate PEC GW were presented in the DAR. The meeting of experts agreed on the approach presented under B.8.6.d for the parent compound, but disagreed with the formation fractions assumed for metabolites M01 and M02, for which a formation fraction of 1 had to be used. After the meeting the RMS presented a new groundwater assessment based on FOCUS PEARL v.3.3.3, and the input parameters agreed by the meeting of experts. Neither the parent compound, nor its major soil metabolites (M01 and M02) exceeded the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L when the EU representative use (cereals seed treatment, 6 g a.s./ha) is simulated. However, due to the low ADI determined for this substance, 10% of the ADI would be reached for adults, toddlers and bottle fed infants, if residue levels of 0.05 mu g/L, 0.017 mu g/L and 0.011 mu g/L, respectively, of each component (triazoxide, M01 and M02) were present in the water. These levels were not exceeded in any of the scenarios simulated for the representative use in cereal seeds. Nevertheless, reliability and predictive capacity of FOCUS GW models is expected to be lower in this low range of concentrations. Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long range transport in air. The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity endpoint, due to food avoidance (endpoint based on consumption in group where there was 30% mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on Yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90% of the daily food requirement of a Yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst case field studies indicated that Yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute time scale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast feeding granivorous bird, like the woodpigeon. In order to reach the LD50, woodpigeons would have to consume 2940 seeds (includes a 10-fold uncertainty factor). A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as seed treatment (the autumn use may also be reproductively relevant for birds in some southern Member States). A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from spring use. The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required to identify a low long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Refinements were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data (see birds above), resulting in a TER value of 0.64. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated drinking water was considered not relevant. Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to aquatic organisms was assessed to be low. Further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to fish. The risk to sediment-dwellers from the metabolite M01, M02 and M05 was assessed as low. The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinements to fully address the potential toxicity of residues in the soil matrix. As for other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was low for all potential soil residues, but it still remains to address the potential risk to soil litter degrading processes from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02. The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment and non-target plants.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tri-allate Issued on 26 September 2008,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.181r,"Tri-allate is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(1). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on tri-allate in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July - August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide in barley and wheat for the control of wild oat, black-grass and meadow-grass as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached endpoints. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Avadex 15G' ('Mon 7966'), a granule (GR) containing 150 g/kg tri-allate. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor residues given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and in environmental matrices, however a data gap was set for a monitoring method for residues in food of animal origin. In the mammalian metabolism studies, tri-allate was rapidly but incompletely absorbed after oral administration. It was evenly distributed and extensively metabolised, showing no potential for accumulation. According to the precautionary principle, classification of tri-allate as Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"" was proposed, however acute dermal and inhalation toxicity were low. Tri-allate was not a skin or eye irritant; classification with risk phrase R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed according to the results of a Magnusson & Kligman test. Decreased body weight and clinical signs of neurotoxicity were the most common effects found in rats, dogs and hamsters upon short-term administration. Reversible anaemia and liver toxicity were also found in these species, while the liver was the main target organ in mice. Upon long-term exposure, reduced body weight and liver toxicity were still evident, but no potential for carcinogenicity was observed in rat, mouse or hamster. Although some in vitro tests (mainly Ames tests and a Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay) gave positive results, based on the weight of evidence, tri- allate was considered to have no genotoxic potential in vivo. Reproduction toxicity studies reflected the same kind of effects in parents, as in short-term studies. In the two generation study, reduced pregnancy rate was associated with parental toxicity and in the developmental study in rat; decreased foetal weight and retarded ossification were linked to maternal toxicity. In rabbit an apparent increase in the incidence of fused sternebrae was observed without maternal toxicity, this finding gave rise to an intense debate by the experts, but considering the low severity of the effect, the meeting agreed not to propose a classification related to developmental toxicity for tri-allate. No sign indicative of delayed neurotoxicity was found in acute and short-term neurotoxicity studies in hen. Clear signs of neurobehavioural toxicity were seen in an acute and a short-term neurotoxicity studies in rat. No inhibition of cholinesterase activity was detected, but a special investigation showed a strong correlation between the presence of axonal degeneration in the brain and CNS-like behavioural effects caused by tri- allate leading to a proposal for classification with Xn, R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"". A data package of studies was provided on the metabolite TCPSA(2), a major metabolite in plant and the environment, leading to the conclusion that TCPSA is not relevant for groundwater and that the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of tri-allate covers the toxicity of the metabolite. The ADI of tri-allate was 0.025 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.032 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study in rat, a safety factor of 100 and a correction factor for low oral absorption of 50 %; and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.6 mg/kg bw based on the acute neurotoxicity study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was 12 % for the concentrate and in-use spray dilution, based on an in vivo study in monkeys. The level of operator exposure calculated for the representative formulation 'Avadex 15G', at a maximum dose rate of 2.25 kg tri-allate/ha was below the AOEL according to selected data from the Pesticide Handler's Exposure Database (PHED), considering the use of gloves during loading and application of the granules. Worker exposure was not considered relevant for the representative use of tri-allate. Estimated bystander and residential exposure resulting from the use of 'Avadex 15G' was below the AOEL. Metabolism studies of tri-allate labelled in the allyl position were considered in the DAR which showed that residues consisted primarily of metabolites TCPSA, M14(3) and M15(4). A provisional residue definition for risk assessment of tri-allate, TCPSA and the glycoside conjugates (M14 and M15) expressed as tri-allate was proposed by the residues expert meeting. The residue definition proposed in the DAR did not include the glycoside conjugates. In addition, the expert meeting concluded the metabolism could not be finalised because there is a data gap for a wheat study of tri-allate labelled in the diisopropylamine moiety. The meeting identified this data gap to address a concern about the potential formation of nitrosamines from the diisopropylamine moiety in plants. It should be noted that in wheat grain, total metabolites were 0.008 mg/kg (5.10 % of TRR). In radio-labelled rotational crop studies the residue was made up of tri-allate and TCPSA but it was questioned why M14 and M15 were not looked for. In addition, it was considered that, on the basis of the residue levels in radish roots (at 30 days after application) in these studies, a data gap should be identified for field studies. The primary crop residue trials data in wheat and barley presented analysis for tri-allate and TCPSA. No accurate conversion factor is available to enable levels of glycoside conjugates to be accounted for. Residues were seen to be stable in frozen storage for up to 56 months. The need for processing studies is not currently triggered. Intakes by livestock triggered the need for animal metabolism data for ruminants. A goat metabolism study showed the majority of radioactivity was incorporated into natural compounds. The only possible compounds of significance were tri-allate and TCPSA, and the feeding studies confirmed this. The risk assessment could not be finalised because of the inclusion of 'glycoside conjugates' in the residue definition. Additionally, the theoretical concern over the formation of nitrosamines has resulted in a data gap for a wheat metabolism study. On this basis no maximum residue levels (MRL) were proposed by the expert meeting. The risk assessment can not be finalised because of the rotational crop issue amongst others. Only studies with tri-allate labelled in the allylic position are available in the fate and behaviour section. The need for addressing the metabolites that may result from the diisopropylamine moiety was identified during the peer review and discussed in the PRAPeR meeting. The applicant provided a position paper to clarify this issue. This position paper made use of public scientific literature to select the input parameters for modelling and as part of the consideration for estimating the formation of nitrosamines potentially produced by water treatment. These scientific papers had not been previously submitted in the dossier. In view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new (i.e. newly submitted) studies after the submission of the DAR to the EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007, the new studies could not be considered in the peer review. However the meeting considered that the issue needs to be addressed and therefore identified a data gap to address the potential formation of diisopropylamine(5) in soil and contamination of ground water. Tri-allate exhibited moderate to medium persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DissT(50) = 35 - 61 d); however these rates may only be considered as dissipation rates since volatilization contributed to a great extent to the losses observed. Data were reanalyzed by the applicant with ModelMaker (V.4.0.) to separate the degradation and volatilization processes. The calculated degradation rates were in the range of DT50 = 38.4 - 75.2 d. Of the six or seven minor metabolites identified, only TCPSA (max. 3.74 % AR by HPLC and max. 7.38 % AR by TLC) was fully characterized and further addressed for environmental risk assessment. TCPSA exhibited low to moderate persistence under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C in soil. Volatiles collected in the organic traps (max. 16.17 % AR after 120 d) of the aerobic degradation experiments were not characterized but were assumed to be tri-allate. Unextractable radioactivity amounted to max. 25.3 % AR at the end of the study (120 days after treatment). Radioactivity found in the ethanolamine trap (max. 21.2 % AR after 120 d) was assumed to be CO2. The need for further identification of potentially volatile tri-allate soil metabolites and the characterization of soil metabolites found in the available study had been identified during the peer review. The majority of experts agreed with the rapporteur Member State that it is reasonable to assume that the non-characterised radioactivity in the volatile traps is the active substance. The EU risk assessment of the representative use proposed could therefore be acceptably concluded without further regard to the characterisation of the volatiles. However some experts considered that it is necessary to confirm the complete route of degradation for national risk assessments and therefore a data gap was identified for a study to investigate the aerobic degradation in soil including identification of residues in volatile organic traps and adequate identification of soil metabolites. Tri-allate was very highly persistent in soil under anaerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Photolysis in soil of tri-allate is almost negligible when compared with aerobic degradation. A field dissipation study with trials at four different United Kingdom sites is available. Tri-allate exhibited low to high persistence in these trials. The rapporteur Member State assessed the studies as scientifically valid and representative of Northern European conditions. However they proposed using data obtained from laboratory degradation studies for environmental modelling for EU risk assessment due to the potential effect of volatilization on the results of these trials. The DT90's observed in some of the field dissipation studies were above 1 yr and triggered the need to assess potential of accumulation of tri-allate in soil. PEC in soil and accumulation of tri-allate in soil were estimated on the basis of the worst case field half-life of 205 d. For TCPSA the PEC in soil was estimated on basis of the maximum observed in the laboratory studies determined by TLC. Tri-allate may be considered immobile to slightly mobile in soil according the available study. Metabolite TCPSA may be considered very highly mobile in soil according to the available study. Tri-allate was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4 and 7 at 50 degrees C, however it hydrolyses under alkaline conditions. The half-life at 25 degrees C in the aqueous pH 9 solution was 52 d. Aqueous photolysis is not expected to contribute to the environmental degradation of tri-allate on basis of the lack of UV absorption at wavelengths above 290 nm. Biodegradability studies available show that tri-allate is not readily biodegradable. In the water sediment systems, tri-allate dissipated relatively rapidly from water by partition to the sediment and volatilization. Half-lives of tri-allate in the whole system are 52.8 - 62.0 d. No major metabolites were identified either in the water or in the sediment phases. Mineralization and unextractable residues in the sediment are practically negligible (CO2 = 1.51 - 4.35 % AR; unextractable in sediment = 2.77 - 3.26 % AR). PECSW/SED were calculated for tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA on the basis of the FOCUS SW scheme and models for the scenarios relevant to cereals in Northern EU (D1-D5, R1). Since the product is a granular formulation, the applicant proposed spray drift values for the granules based on a specific study. The approach was considered acceptable by the rapporteur Member State and reported as Step 3 calculations. Additional FOCUS Step 4 calculations included spray drift mitigation by buffer zones and run off mitigation by vegetative buffer strips. The method used to implement runoff mitigation is not agreed in the latest FOCUS Landscape and mitigation guidance document and therefore the rapporteur Member State recalculated the Step 4 FOCUS SW without run off mitigation. Potential ground water contamination by tri-allate and its soil metabolite TCPSA was addressed by modelling calculations with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2. The rapporteur Member State calculations resulted in 80th percentile annual average concentrations in the leachate at 1 m depth below 0.001 mu g/L for tri-allate and in the range of 0.76 - 15.42 mu g/L for metabolite TCPSA. The metabolite TCPSA has a clear potential to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L in ground water and requires assessment of its toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance including consumers risk assessment. Relevance of TCPSA was assessed during the peer review following the step-wise procedure set out in the guidance document for relevance of metabolites in ground water (see sections 2.8, 3.3 and 5.2). Tri-allate is a volatile organic compound and studies available indicate that tri-allate displays significant volatilisation from soil surfaces. However on the basis of the atmospheric half-life calculated (DT50 = 3.8 h), it is considered unlikely that tri-allate may be subjected to long-range transport. The first tier risk assessment for direct consumption of granules results in values above the trigger values, indicating low acute, short-term and long-term risk for small seed-eating birds and mammals. The risk to grazing birds and mammals from consumption of residues of tri-allate in the young cereal shoots was estimated using the residues data presented in the DAR. The acute, short-term and long-term TER estimated for birds and the acute and long-term TER values estimated for mammals were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk for birds and mammals. Potential for bioaccumulation was considered since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06. The first tier TER values estimated for earthworm-eating birds was above the Annex VI trigger value, however the TER value for earthworm-eating mammals was below the Annex VI trigger value. After a refinement process the risk to earthworm-eating mammals was considered as low. The first tier TER values for fish-eating birds and mammals were 7 and 1.9, respectively, indicating a low risk for fish-eating birds. A potential high risk for fish-eating mammals was identified. A data gap was identified by the EFSA after the PRAPeR 48 meeting to ask to the applicant to submit a new refinement of the potential high risk for fish-eating mammals. Based on the available studies, tri-allate was considered very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic TER values based on the used of PECSW from FOCUS step 4 with a 10 m non spray buffer zone were above the Annex VI trigger values. Risk mitigation measures similar to 10 m non spray buffer zone are needed in Member States. The risk of the TCPSA metabolite for aquatic organisms is low. Since tri-allate has a log P-ow of 4.06 the potential for bioconcentration should be considered. The BCF = 1400 was derived from a study with Lepomis macrochirus. The EFSA noted after the meeting that tri-allate has a BCF > 1000 and a field soil DT90 > 100 days. For these reasons the EFSA identified a data gap to assess the potential for biomagnification of tri-allate through aquatic food chains. A low acute risk was identified for earthworms. The long-term risk to earthworms needs further refinement. It is proposed by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR that further information is required on the long-term risk to earthworms. Further information is required to fully address the potential risk of tri-allate to other non-target macro-organisms. A data gap was proposed for the submission of a litter bag study. Risk mitigation such as an in-field no spray buffer zone of 10 m was considered necessary for the non-target plants. The risk was considered to be low to bees, non-target arthropods, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance spirodiclofen,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.339r,"Spirodiclofen is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 The Netherlands received an application from Bayer CropScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2002/593/EC3. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State, The Netherlands, made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on spirodiclofen, hereafter referred to as the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), available on 21 April 2004. The peer review was initiated on 18 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an Evaluation Meeting on 9 February 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Scientific Report (2007) 104 which was finalised on 13 June 2007. At the request of the Commission spirodiclofen was re-discussed within a series of scientific meetings with Member States experts in April - May 2009 in the sections of physical and chemical properties, mammalian toxicology and ecotoxicology. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009. The conclusion has been amended accordingly. This updated conclusion replaces the previous version, which was finalised on 13 June 2007 (EFSA, 2007) The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide and acaricide as proposed by the applicant which comprises of spray application to control mites and sucking insects. Full details of the GAP can be found in the table ""List of representative uses evaluated"" which is in the end points list in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Envidor SC 240"", a suspension concentrate containing 240 g/L spirodiclofen. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine the residues of spirodiclofen and its enol metabolite(4) in soil, water and animal products and spirodiclofen in air. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Spirodiclofen is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal and inhalation routes. It is not a skin or eye irritant, but it is a skin sensitiser, therefore R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" was proposed. The overall relevant NOAEL is 1.45 mg/kg bw/day (liver and adrenal effects) for repeated dose administration to spirodiclofen. Spirodiclofen chronic administration results in liver tumours in mice, Leydig cell tumours and uterus adenocarcinomas in rats, with clear NOAELs demonstrated. The classification R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" was proposed. Spirodiclofen has no genotoxic, reproductive and developmental toxicity potential. The subchronic NOAEL for neurotoxicity is 70 mg/kg bw/day, while the chronic neurotoxicity NOAEL is 110 mg/kg bw/day. The established Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.009 mg/kg bw/ day (100 safety factor applied). The allocation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. Estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all uses. The metabolism of spirodiclofen in fruit has been fully elucidated and proceeds through ester cleavage and hydrolysis steps. The parent compound was identified as the major constituent of the residue on fruit crops at various PHIs. The identified metabolites are present at very low levels but are considered as having similar toxicological properties as the parent compound. Given the predominance of spirodiclofen in the terminal residue in fruits, the residue definition can be restricted to spirodiclofen only, for both risk assessment and monitoring. Under processing, spirodiclofen is degraded only at temperatures of 100 degrees C or higher to spirodiclofen-enol, and hence under conditions representative for fruit processing (pH 4, 90 degrees C) no generation of spirodiclofen-enol is expected. Upon exposure of livestock to spirodiclofen one main component of the residue in food of animal origin was identified as spirodiclofen-enol, and was defined as the residue of concern in terms of consumer exposure. Based on the results of the ruminant feeding studies MRLs for food of animal origin could be derived. The consumer risk assessment showed that the chronic exposure to spirodiclofen residues from fruit and spirodiclofen-enol residues from food of animal origin is well below the ADI of spirodiclofen. Because an ARfD is considered not necessary, the acute risk for the consumer does not need to be assessed. The available data demonstrate that spirodiclofen degrades in soil to the major (> 10% applied radioactivity (AR)) metabolites BAJ 2740-enol, BAJ 2740-ketohydroxy(5), BAJ 2740-dihydroxy(6) and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid (M16). Aerobic degradation of spirodiclofen in soil proceeds via hydrolytic and enzymatic/microbial pathways. Mineralization was significant (22.5-93.1% AR by day 120 with the dihydrofuranone-label and 69.1% AR with the cyclohexyl-label), and non extractable residues accounted for maximum 14.4 and 17.9% AR. In soil spirodiclofen, BAJ 2740-dihydroxy and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid exhibited low to moderate persistence, BAJ 2740-ketohydroxy exhibited very low to moderate persistence and BAJ 2740-enol can be classified as low persistent. The possibility that anaerobic conditions are encountered after application is unlikely as the proposed applications to orchard crops and grapes will occur during the spring (only for grapes) or summer months. Adsorption coefficients of the major metabolites BAJ 2740-enol, BAJ 2740-dihydroxy and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid indicated that they are very highly mobile, whereas the parent spirodiclofen is strongly adsorbed to soil particles, and BAJ 2740-ketohydroxy can be classified as low mobile. There was no evidence of pH dependant adsorption. The low potential of spirodiclofen for leaching was confirmed in the aged column leaching study (<0.1% AR in leachate), but BAJ 2740-enol and 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid were detected in the leachate at 17.4 and 19.0% AR, respectively. FOCUS-PEARL modelling for all crops and EU-scenarios, based on average DT50, Koc and 1/n values from laboratory studies, predicted 80th percentile of annual average concentrations in groundwater of < 0.001 mu g/L for parent spirodiclofen, BAJ 2740-ketohydroxy, <= 0.001 mu g/L for the metabolites BAJ 2740-enol and BAJ 2740-dihydroxy and up to 0.012 mu g/L for 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid. In shallow natural waters, the major dissipation route of spirodiclofen will be hydrolysis, microbial degradation and partitioning to the sediment (DT(50)system 2.3-4.2 days). Photolysis will not contribute to the dissipation of spirodiclofen in the aquatic environment. In sediment, spirodiclofen dissipates rapidly with DT50 values of 2.5-4.4 days. Only low levels of nonextracted residues are formed. BAJ 2740-enol is the major sediment/water metabolite (max. 84% and 30% AR in water and sediment, respectively), dissipating from the water of one system with a DT50 of 186 days, but stable in the water of the second system. In the sediment of both systems, the levels of BAJ 2740-enol continued to increase throughout the study. The lifetime of this metabolite in natural aquatic systems is likely to be controlled by photochemical degradation (DT50 in Rhine water 7.6 hours) rather than biological and chemical degradation. The pathway of anaerobic water/sediment degradation of spirodiclofen is similar, but rates of dissipation are lower (9.8 and 10 days in sediment and overall system, respectively). The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route of entry to surface water for spirodiclofen and BAJ 2740-enol. Member States should therefore carry out a surface water exposure and consequent aquatic risk assessment from the runoff and drainage routes of exposure at the national level. Contamination of spirodiclofen in the air compartment and transport though it is not expected to be significant. The risk to birds and mammals was assessed as low for the representative uses evaluated. The aquatic risk assessment was based on spray drift as the only route of entry into surface water. The acute TER values for aquatic organisms were markedly above the trigger values but the long-term TER values for fish, daphnids and sediment-dwelling insects were below the Annex VI trigger of 10. Risk-mitigation measures such as no-spray buffer zones of up to 30m (early use in orchards), 15m (late use in orchards) and 10m (late use in vines) are required to mitigate the long-term risk to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to adult bees is low but larval stages are susceptible. Temporary adverse effects on bee brood development with recovery after 4 weeks were observed in field tests. Therefore it is suggested that the product should not be applied during flowering of the crop and to label the product accordingly. The standard laboratory tests suggested a high potential risk to predatory mites. Field tests with T. pyri showed that recovery within one year after the application is possible and the risk to nontarget arthropods is considered as sufficiently addressed for the representative uses. Effects of >25% on soil nitrification were observed in tests with spirodiclofen and its major soil metabolites. The effects caused by the metabolites occurred on day 14 but were <25 % at day 28, and also the effects of spirodiclofen were <25% after day 56. Since the tested concentrations were a factor of 2 to 66 times higher than the initial PECsoil values and the effects were of a temporary nature it is assumed that the observed effects would not cause a high risk to soil functioning at the application rates suggested in the representative uses. The risk to earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment were assessed as low for the representative uses.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance folpet,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.297r,"Folpet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on folpet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 20 October 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 6 July 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Makhteshim Agan. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 14 December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions. The outcome of experts' consultation was re-discussed within a series of scientific meetings in the section of mammalian toxicology and residues with Member States experts in November 2007 and April 2008. The conclusion has been amended accordingly and the changed reference values are laid down in this report. This updated conclusion replaces the previous version, which was finalised on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 70 refers). The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control various fungi in winter wheat, tomatoes and wine grapes at application rates of up to 750 g folpet per hectare in winter cereals, up to 1.6 kg in tomatoes and up to 1.5 kg in wine grapes. Folpet can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Folpan 80 WDG"", a water dispersible granule (WG), registered in some EU Member States. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, i.e. folpet in soil, water and air. It should be noted that for surface water no enforcement method is needed for the determination of folpet, due to the fact that the DT90 value is below 3 d (the trigger value given in SANCO/825/00). For food of plant origin no validated analytical methods for monitoring purposes are available. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. However, due to some outstanding data no final specification can be proposed for the technical material at the moment. Folpet has a low acute oral and dermal toxicity but it is R20 'Harmful by Inhalation'. It is not irritating to the skin but it is severely irritating to eyes (proposal for classification as R41 ""Risk of serious damage to eyes"") and is a skin sensitiser (R43 'May cause sensitisation by skin contact' is proposed). Folpet does not show any genotoxic potential in vivo but it is carcinogenic in the mouse (category 3, R 40 proposed for the classification by the majority of the experts), with a clear threshold identified. Folpet did not cause adverse effects on adult fertility or reproduction in rats over two generations, but was shown to be teratogenic in rabbits (classification as R63 is still under discussion and is forwarded to ECB). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.2 mg/kg bw. The operator estimated exposure accounts for 34 to 77% of the AOEL in outdoor scenarios (German model with PPE considered). Estimates provided for operator exposure in glass-houses ranged from 29% to 33% of the AOEL (PPE is worn). The exposure of bystanders is 1.6% of the AOEL. Worker exposure in harvesting grapes and tomatoes without protective gloves is 133% and 68% of the AOEL, with PPE such as gloves it is assumed that the exposure is below the AOEL. Worker exposure following applications of folpet to wheat can be expected to be lower than following applications to grapes or tomatoes. The metabolism of folpet in plants has been adequately elucidated. The main degradation products after release of the trichloromethylthio-side chain are phthalimide and phthalic acid. As it is not possible at this stage to fully characterize the toxicological properties of phthalimide, this metabolite needs to be included in the residue definition for plant products for monitoring and risk assessment purposes. Supervised residue trials were carried out in most cases with analysis of folpet only and therefore it is not possible to establish MRLs and to conduct an exposure assessment covering the contribution of phthalimide to the residue. However, taking into account folpet only, an acute risk for toddlers consuming treated table grapes has been identified. Specific studies allowing a clear understanding of the behaviour of the compound during processing are not available. The drastic reduction of folpet level in processed commodities and the physico-chemical properties of the compound suggest that important amounts of phthalimide and/or phthalic acid could be produced during processing. No residue of folpet and related metabolites are expected in rotational crops and in animal commodities. Folpet is very low or low persistent in soil. First degradation step involves the release of the highly reactive thiophosgene to yield the major soil metabolite phthalimide which is further degraded through phthalamic acid to phthalic acid. All major folpet metabolites are also very low or low persistent in soil under aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. Mineralization is high and unextractable residues are formed in moderate amounts (max. 31.2 % AR at 14 d). In relation to the thiophosgene moiety, further information was derived from captan. The experts' meeting agreed that it is not expected that free thiophosgene will reach significant levels due to the degradation of folpet in soil. Under anaerobic conditions folpet degraded slightly slower and no new metabolites were identified. Photolysis does not contribute significantly to the environmental dissipation of folpet. PEC soil presented in the DAR were based on worst case laboratory half life (DT50 = 4.3 d) with the critical GAP of ten applications of 1.5 kg a.s / ha at 7 days interval (grapes use). In the addendum March 2005 PEC soil are recalculated for all three uses taking into account crop interception given for FOCUS GW. However, EFSA considers that this calculation is not adequate for vines (were interception factor has been averaged) and needs to be further justified for tomatoes. New PEC soil values calculated by EFSA were used in the risk assessment for earthworms presented in the conclusion. Due to ambiguities with respect to the time of application interception for PEC soil, calculation cannot be established for wheat. Folpet was estimated (based on physical chemical properties or theoretical calculations) to be medium mobile (K-oc = 304 mL / g), phtalamic acid very high mobile (Koc = 10 mL / g) and phthalic acid high mobile (K-oc = 73 mL / g) in soil. Phthalimide was experimentally found to be medium to high mobile in soil (K-foc = 72 - 385 mL / g). Hydrolysis of folpet is rapid at acidic and neutral pH (DT50 < 3 h) and very rapid at alkaline pH (DT50 < 3 min). Main hydrolysis metabolites were phathalimide and phthalic acid. Trichlomethylsulfenic acid and tricloromethylmercaptan are postulated to be the two major non characterized hydrolysis metabolites of folpet. These metabolites will degrade to thiophosgene, carbon oxysulfide and ultimately to CO2. Phthalimide was stable at 25 degrees C and pHs 4 and 7 and at pH 9 was hydrolysed with a half life of 2 h. Contribution of photolysis to the aqueous degradation of folpet was not significant. Folpet was shown to be readily biodegradable at concentrations of 1 mg C/L. In the water sediment systems folpet degrades very rapidly and mineralization is relatively high. Folpet is not found in the sediment phase. Major metabolites in the water phase were phthalimide, phthalamic acid, phthalic acid, benzamide and 2-cyanobenzoic acid. No major metabolite was found in the sediment phase. All the metabolites degraded rapidly in both systems (DT50 < 7 d). After the Experts' meeting new PECsw calculations have been presented based on FOCUS scheme. Whereas not peer reviewed, EFSA can confirm that the parameters already agreed by the experts' meeting have been used in this calculation. Values obtained for the different representative uses are lower than the worst case runoff estimation presented in the DAR (577 mu g/L). This level could be of concern only for metabolite phthalimide. Therefore, FOCUS STEP 1 values have been used to complete the assessment of this metabolite (See 5.2.). FOCUS sw calculations for the parent up to STEP 4 are also summarized in the addendum of October 2005, these calculations have not been peer reviewed and have not been used for the EU risk assessment. The acute risk to birds was assessed as low in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The short-term and long-term TER values for herbivorous birds were below the Annex VI triggers of 10 and 5. But since the TER value of >8.9 is based on a NOEC from the highest tested dose and tomato foliage is considered not to be an attractive food source, the risk to herbivorous birds is assumed to be low for the representative use in tomatoes A high long term risk to insectivorous birds was identified in a first tier risk assessment for all representative uses. The refined risk assessment for birds was discussed in the EPCO expert meeting. It was agreed that the risk assessment should not be based on the highest observed NOEC of 769 mg a.s./kg/d and that the RUD refinement would not cover the risk from uptake of residues in small insects. On the basis of the peer reviewed data a high long-term risk to insectivorous birds cannot be excluded. The risk to mammals is low for the representative uses in winter wheat and tomatoes but a high acute and long term risk to small herbivorous mammals cannot be excluded for the representative use in grapes. The first tier risk assessment for the uptake of contaminated drinking water resulted in a high acute risk for birds and mammals if the solution is sprayed at the highest recommended concentration. The risk of secondary poisoning of birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated earthworms and fish is considered to be low for all representative uses. The intrinsic toxicity of folpet to fish and daphnids is high. Due to very rapid degradation the toxicity under static conditions is markedly lower. The acute risk to fish and daphnids is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer buffer zones of 5 m for the use in winter wheat and tomatoes and 10 m for the use in grapes are required. A long-term risk assessment for aquatic organisms is required since the representative uses cover multiple applications leading to repeated exposure. The long-term risk to fish is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer zones of 5 m and 15 m are required to for the representative uses in winter wheat, tomatoes and grapes, respectively. The available data do not allow drawing a conclusion on the long-term risk to aquatic invertebrates. The endpoints from a flow through study would lead to an overestimation of the long-term risk to daphnids. The risk of bioaccumulation and the risk from major metabolites posed to aquatic organisms are considered to be low. The risk to earthworms is low for the use in tomatoes but a high risk to earthworms cannot be excluded for the uses in grapes. The risk to earthworms from the use in winter wheat cannot be concluded until a reliable PEC soil is established. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, other non-target organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance trifluralin,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.327r,"Trifluralin is one of the 52 substances of the second stage covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on trifluralin in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 July 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 24 July 2003 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce comprising of Agan Chemical Manufacturers Ltd. and Dintec Agroquimica Produtos Quimicos Lda. at the time of finalisation of the conclusion. Subsequently, the comments received were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 15 January 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April, May and June 2004 (round 1-2 of the EPCO expert meetings). A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 10 February 2005 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28) Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/629/EC) 4 concerning the non-inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the European Union Trifluralin Taskforce made a resubmission application for the inclusion of trifluralin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows: the high toxicity to aquatic organisms, in particular fish the high potential for bioaccumulation the high persistence in soil the potential for long- range transport via air In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on trifluralin in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 19 January 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 January 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 3 March 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 24 April 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings and a telephone conference with Member State experts in May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been reissued to update the risk assessment in the areas of residues, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier which comprised spraying to bare soil to control grass and broad-leaved weeds in oilseed rape, sunflower, cotton and winter cereals at application rate up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The use on winter cereals was no longer supported in the resubmission application, and therefore the conclusion has only been updated in relation to the risk assessment for the representative uses presented in the Additional Report, i.e. use only on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton at an application rate of up to 1.2 kg trifluralin per hectare. The risk assessment presented for winter cereals has not been updated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Europe. For the uses on oilseed rape, sunflower and cotton, incorporation into soil takes place after the application. Trifluralin can be used only as a pre-sowing/pre-emergence herbicide. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. In the mammalian metabolism studies, trifluralin is extensively and rapidly metabolised. Within 48 hours, 82 % is absorbed and more than 90 % is excreted within 168 hours mainly via bile. It has a low acute toxicity, but displayed sensitising properties and should be labelled with Xi; R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". The relevant oral no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the short-term studies was 2.4 mg/kg bw/day in the 1-year dog study, based on increased liver weight and some minor changes in the chemistry. The dermal and inhalation toxicity after subchronic exposure was low. Regarding genotoxic properties of trifluralin it was concluded that trifluralin induces weak clastogenic and aneugenic effects in a number of in vivo and in vitro studies, but this was not confirmed in a more reliable micronucleus test. Trifluralin induced neoplastic changes and carcinogenic effects such as Leydig cell tumours, thyroid tumours, urinary bladder tumours and renal carcinoma in rats. Since no NOAEL could be established, the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 30 mg/kg bw/day in the rat is assigned as the most relevant effect level. The following risk phrase is proposed Xn; R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"". There were no direct effects on reproductive performance or fertility observed, and the relevant NOAEL for reproduction was set to 4.5-5.8 mg/kg bw/day in the rat based on haematological changes, decreased maternal body weight during gestation and decreased offspring growth and survival, respectively. Trifluralin did not induce teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at non-maternally toxic doses. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 50 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit based on decreased foetal weight, post implantation losses and reduced body weight, food consumption, respectively. The proposed acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the LOAEL in the rat carcinogenicity study with a margin of safety between LOAEL and ADI of 2000, since the ADI is based on a LOAEL value instead of a NOAEL value and that at this dose level tumour formation was evident. The proposed acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.026 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL in the 90-day mechanistic study in rats using a safety factor of 100. No correction for oral absorption is required. No acute reference dose (ArfD) is allocated. The outcome of the risk assessment for the plant protection product 'EF-1521' ('Treflan'), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 480 g trifluralin/L showed that the estimated operator exposure levels (according to German model) were below the AOEL only if personal protective equipment (PPE) are used both during mixing/loading (gloves) and application (gloves and coverall). The calculated exposure levels for bystanders were also below the established AOEL. The value of dermal absorption is 10 % for the concentrate and the diluted formulation. There was no need for estimating the worker exposure, since trifluralin is a pre-emergence herbicide applied directly to soil. The metabolism of trifluralin was investigated in cereals (maize) and oilseed crops (rapeseed, soybean and cotton). In maize, trifluralin was extensively metabolised and residues were shown to consist of numerous compounds, with few being identified due to their low levels. The uptake was also limited in rapeseed with low radioactive residues at harvest. No parent trifluralin was detected in mature seeds and mature plant samples; the major compound identified (ca 35% of the total radioactive residue) was the metabolite TR-145, mainly as conjugate. However, and considering its absolute low level, the PRAPeR 70 meeting of experts on residues agreed not to include this metabolite in the residue definitions. Finally, it was concluded that the residue definitions for risk assessment and monitoring initially proposed by the EPCO 05 meeting of experts for cereals and limited to the parent trifluralin only, are also applicable to the oilseed crops. No residues of trifluralin above the limit of quantification (LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg) were detected in any of the grain samples collected in the supervised trials conducted on rapeseed, sunflower and cotton according to the critical GAP in Northern and Southern Europe. Processing studies were not submitted and were considered not necessary. Livestock studies were not assessed in the framework of the resubmission since no significant residues are expected in oilseed commodities at harvest. The chronic dietary exposure assessment for consumers based on the EFSA PRIMo rev2 and the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs) of 0.01* mg/kg for rapeseed, sunflower and cotton leads to estimated intakes less than 0.1% of the proposed ADI for all the European diets included in the model. No ARfD was allocated, thus, no acute risk calculation was performed for trifluralin. In aerobic conditions degradation of trifluralin in soil did not lead to any major metabolite. Under flooded anaerobic conditions a major metabolite TR-46 is formed. Furthermore, metabolite TR-14 was formed at amounts above 5 % at the end of the study in all three anaerobic soils tested. Due to its potential degradation under aerobic conditions, TR-4 may be addressed by Member States where anaerobic conditions are envisaged to be relevant. Whereas not discussed in particular during the peer review, it is EFSA's opinion that the same conclusion may be reached for metabolite TR-14. Under aerobic laboratory conditions trifluralin is medium to highly persistent with half- lives between 81 to 356 days at 22 degrees C. The degradation under anaerobic conditions was faster than under aerobic conditions. Data indicate that trifluralin is strongly adsorbed to soil and could be classified as immobile. Trifluralin is hydrolytically stable under environmentally relevant conditions. Aqueous photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of trifluralin producing metabolites TR-67 and TR-158. Trifluralin is not readily biodegradable. During the peer review, it was agreed that worst case DT50 = 13 days should be employed for the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion, and that a DT50 = 2 days could be used to refine the risk assessment when appropriate. Due to the potential contribution of photolysis to the dissipation of trifluralin in water, the fate and behaviour in the environment EPCO 02 expert meeting confirmed the need of a water sediment study, conducted in the presence of light, that could be used by Member States to refine the risk assessment performed in the context of Annex I inclusion. In the resubmission dossier new PEC SW/SED values based on step 3 and step 4 FOCUS SW were provided for trifluralin. In spite of the drawbacks of the calculations available, the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts concluded that the maximum PECSW and PECSED at step 3 would result from a loading to the water body driven by drift, and a reliable risk assessment would be obtained if this maximum value is used for the risk assessment. However, if information on the pattern of exposure at step 3 or step 4 calculations are needed for the assessment, then the calculations available would be not acceptable and/or would be insufficient to finalize the risk assessment. The PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts identified a data gap for FOCUS SW calculations that provide the information needed to finalize the EU risk assessment. Neither trifluralin nor its anaerobic metabolite TR-4 are expected to contaminate ground water at levels above 0.1 mu g/L under the proposed conditions of use. Trifluralin was designated as a ""priority substance"" under the water framework directive9 but has not been identified as a "" priority hazardous substance"". However, trifluralin was added to the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North- East Atlantic) List of Chemicals for Priority action in 2002, because it is considered to be a 'PBT' substance fulfilling the criteria for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity. Because of its high volatility, the occurrence of trifluralin in air and transport through air is possible. However, photochemical half-life in air is estimated to be short. A data gap was identified by the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts for the monitoring data in the Arctic regions reported by Canadian researchers and quoted in the report: 'Trifluralin dossier prepared in support of a proposal of trifluralin to be considered as a candidate for inclusion in the Annex I to the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (LRTAP Protocol on POPs)'. European Commission, DG, Environment, Brussels, July 2007. The risk to insectivorous and fish-eating birds and mammals, bees, ground-dwelling arthropods, soil micro-organisms and earthworms is low with respect to trifluralin and the metabolites as far as investigated. In the original peer review high risks were identified for aquatic organisms, in particular the chronic risk for fish, which requires consideration of appropriate risk mitigation measures. Using the initial predicted environmental concentrations (PEC's) together with the no observed effect level (NOEC) of 0.3 mu g/L leads to a toxicity exposure ratio (TER)-value of 0.38 when a bufferzone of 15 metres is taken into account, which is below the Annex VI trigger value of 10 (without detailed calculations, a bufferzone of 50 m should lead to a TERvalue of approximately 1). Further data were considered necessary to address this risk and enable conclusions on the risk assessment to be drawn. For the resubmission, a new 35-day static early-life-stage (ELS) study was conducted with fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a water-sediment system. In addition to the standard observations (i.e. growth and survival), skeletal irregularity was also analysed. The agreed end point from this study was the NOEC of 3.2 mu g a.s./L. However, since no data on the exposure pattern were available, it was not possible to conclude on the final fish chronic end point to be used for the risk assessment. Therefore, the chronic risk assessment for fish could not be finalised. Based on the data gap identified at the PRAPeR TC 10 meeting of experts on environmental fate and behaviour (see section 4.2.1), a data gap was identified to provide a chronic risk assessment for fish based on the most relevant end point and on step 3 and step 4 PECsw values. The EPCO 08 expert meeting (section ecotoxicology, June 2004) considered the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals as low, based on the TER value reflecting the soil accumulation plateau. EFSA would like to highlight that the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals should be considered further at Member State level when the product is applied after this plateau value is reached. EFSA initially proposed that a new litterbag study should be made available in which the tested dose rate reflects the concentration in the soil after a single application when the accumulation plateau has been reached, as the study which is available at present was performed at a lower dose rate. This data requirement was not discussed in an EPCO expert meeting. No new litterbag study was provided with the resubmission dossier. However, the PRAPeR 68 meeting of experts considered this study no longer necessary. The data gap was therefore not confirmed. The risk to non-target plants could not be calculated with the appropriate end point (median emergence rate (ER50) value) as this value is not reported in the DAR. Based on a conservative no observed effect concentration (NOEC), the risk to non-target plants can be certainly regarded as low if a bufferzone of 5 metres is taken into account. Regulation (EC) No 850/2004(10) of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC11 entered into force when the initial peer review of trifluralin was in an advanced stage. For this reason, the original EFSA conclusion finalised on 14 March 2005 (EFSA Scientific Report (2005) 28) did not specifically assess trifluralin against the criteria set in the paragraph 1 of Annex D of the Stockholm Convention(12). In the framework of the resubmission procedure, it was identified that EFSA should compare the agreed end points against the criteria set in the Stockholm Convention. The result of this assessment is presented under the section Conclusions and Recommendations. EFSA acknowledges that the assessment presented in this conclusion only considers a limited range of representative uses on the basis of the information provided by the notifier in the application dossier and the Member States during the peer review. Therefore, other information may need to be considered by the Commission and the Member States when assessing trifluralin with respect to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance heptamaloxyloglucan,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.334r,"Heptamaloxyloglucan is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 France received an application from Elicityl SA for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision of 2007/560/EC3. Following the agreement between the European Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State France submitted the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on heptamaloxyloglucan, hereafter referred to as the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), which was received by EFSA on 26 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 21 January 2008 by distributing the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009. A final consultation on the outcome of the experts. discussions took place during a written procedure with the Member States in June 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a plant elicitor on grapevines to make them frost hardy. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points attached at Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was,PEL101GV.; it is a lyophilisate (freeze-dried cake). It appears as a white solid block that can break into shiny crumbs of different sizes and shapes after shaking., PEL101GV. cannot be assigned to any of the formulation codes. The codes which are the closest to the preparation are, 'SP' (water soluble powder) and, 'SG' (water soluble granule), as, 'PEL101GV' is a solid to be used for dissolution in water, however the preparation is neither a powder nor a granule. Therefore, it is labelled as, XX. Due to the nature of this compound being an extract from apple pomace, there is no need for methods of analysis for monitoring in food and feed. Risk managers should consider if methods for monitoring are necessary in relation to environmental matrices. Methods for the environmental matrices were not submitted but are likely to be available in published literature. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Heptamaloxyloglucan is generally regarded as safe for human exposure, since it is an oligosaccharide, which is a component of the vegetative cell walls and thus naturally present in food from plant origin, such as drinks (it is extracted from apples). Toxicological studies showed that heptamaloxyloglucan has low acute oral and dermal toxicity. It is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. Heptamaloxyloglucan has also low short-term oral toxicity, since the NOAEL from a 28-day rat study was the highest dose level tested (1000 mg/kg bw/day). The weight of evidence indicates that heptamaloxyloglucan is not a genotoxic agent. Thus, since heptamaloxyloglucan is an oligosaccharide which is a component of the vegetative cell walls and thus naturally present in food from plant origin, and considering its low acute and short-term toxicity and lack of genotoxic potential, long-term toxicity-,carcinogenicity- and reproductive toxicity studies were not performed, and were not required. Likewise, it was agreed not to propose an acceptable daily intake (ADI), or an acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) or an acute reference dose (ARfD), and therefore operator, bystander and worker exposure estimates were considered not necessary. A full residue assessment and consumer risk assessment is not necessary for this compound given its nature and the fact that no toxicological reference values are set for this substance. The information provided by the applicant from published scientific literature was assessed as sufficient to identify the likely route of microbially mediated degradation of heptamaloxyloglucan in soil. These data indicated that the formation of the monomeric sugars D-glucopyranose, D-glucitol, D-xylopyranose, D-galactopyranose and L-fucopyranose as breakdown products would be expected. In a guideline ready biodegradability study that utilised a sewage sludge inoculum, the measurements resulted in heptamaloxyloglucan being classified as readily biodegradable. Information to quantitatively assess the rate of degradation of heptamaloxyloglucan in soil and natural waters or adsorption to soil was not available. Based on water solubility data heptamaloxyloglucan would be expected to be mobile in soil. However, valid worst-case environmental exposure assessments for heptamaloxyloglucan in soil and surface water were performed using conservative assumptions that enabled a satisfactory risk assessment to be completed. The potential for heptamaloxyloglucan to contaminate groundwater at concentrations above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, when used according to the applied for intended use assessed, was concluded to be low. The risk to non-target organisms was expected to be low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance captan,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.296r,"Captan is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20022. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on captan in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 20 October 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 21 June 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the two applicants Makhteshim Chemical Works Ltd and Arysta Life Science SAS (formerly Tomen France). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in 14 December 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions. The outcome of experts' consultation was re-discussed within a series of scientific meetings in the section of mammalian toxicology and residues with Member States experts in November 2007 and April 2008. The conclusion has beenamended accordingly and the changed reference values are laid down in this report. This updated conclusion replaces the previous version, which was finalised on 24 April 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 71 refers). The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises foliar spraying to control a broad range of fungi in pome fruit, tomatoes and peaches at application rate up 2.4 kg (pome fruit), 1.8 kg (tomatoes) and 2.5 kg (peaches) captan per hectare. Captan can be used only as fungicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""Merpan 80 WDG"", registered in some Member State of the EU and ""Malvin WG"", registered under different trade names in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. Both formulations are coded as water dispersible granule (WG). No adequate analytical methods are available to monitor all the compounds given in the residue definitions for food. For the environmental compartment water no enforcement method is needed for the determination of captan, due to the fact that the DT90 values are less than 3 days. In case of soil the DT90 values are only partly (3.6 d) above the 3 day trigger value given in SANCO/825/00. However, analytical methods are available for the determination of captan and THPI in soil and water. For the other matrices (air and blood) no adequate method is available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. A multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that at least limited quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. Captan is rapidly and extensively absorbed and metabolised. Captan is of low toxicity by the oral and dermal routes but it is toxic via inhalation (classification R23 'Toxic by Inhalation' proposed). It is not irritating to the skin but severely irritating to eyes, thus classification as R41 'Risk of serious damage to eyes' is proposed. It is a skin sensitiser (proposal for R43 'May cause sensitisation by skin contact'). Overall, captan did not show any genotoxic potential but was found to cause duodenal tumours in mice. A clear threshold for duodenal tumours in mice was established. The classification category 3, R 40 is proposed by the majority of the MSs. Captan is not teratogenic or embryotoxic by itself but can affect the embryonic development by inducing specific alterations in maternal gastrointestinal physiology. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100; the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.3 mg/kg bw. The ADI and the ARfD is applicable to the general population. Operator exposure estimates (German model) accounts for 56 to 91% (hand held and tractor mounted application) of the AOEL when PPE is worn. The exposure of bystanders is approximately 25% of the AOEL. Both modelling and field exposure data indicate that the exposure of workers involved with the handling of crops treated with is below the AOEL for re-entry at 14 days. The metabolism of captan in plants has been adequately elucidated. Captan forms the major part of residue and only one metabolite, THPI has been identified as contributing in a significant way to the toxicological burden. The levels of THPI are drastically increased in case of processing of treated commodities involving a heating step. However the information on the behaviour of captan under processing conditions should be further investigated by degradation studies under representative hydrolytic conditions. Although argumentation has been presented tending to demonstrate that THPI is of lower toxicity than the parent compound, the available data are not sufficient to firmly conclude on its toxicological non relevance. Therefore the residue definition in plant commodities should be the sum of captan and THPI. Supervised residue trials have been conducted allowing to determine the needed MRLs for the representative uses and to conduct acute and chronic dietary exposure assessments. Residues of captan and of its metabolite THPI are not expected in succeeding crops. In accordance with the proposed mode of application in representative uses, MRLs should be established at 10 mg/kg for apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. However, at this level, residues present an acute risk for the safety of the consumer. Only the use on tomatoes for which an MRL of 2 mg/kg may be proposed leads to consumer intakes below the trigger toxicological levels of acceptable exposure. The animal metabolism of captan is extensive, and no captan as such is present in animal commodities. Only structurally related metabolites were identified in edible animal tissues: THPI, 3-OH THPI and 5-OH THPI. These metabolites should be included in the residue definition for animal products. Metabolism studies suggest that these metabolites should not be present above usual Limits of Quantification of monitoring analysis, but existing feeding studies should be evaluated to confirm that expectation. In soil under aerobic conditions captan exhibits very low to low persistence, breaking down to the major metabolites 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI, max. 66% applied radioactivity (AR) at 7 days) and tetrahydrophthalimic acid (THPAM, max. 17% AR at 14 days), which exhibited low to moderate persistence. Significant mineralisation of the trichloromethyl, and carbonyl portions of the molecule occurred accounting for 81-91% AR, with unextracted radioactivity accounting for 714% AR. Photolysis at the soil surface was not a significant mechanism for degradation. The published literature indicated captan would be expected to exhibit high to medium soil mobility. Laboratory batch adsorption studies indicated THPI exhibited very high soil mobility. No pattern between adsorption and soil pH was apparent for these two compounds. THPAM exhibited very high to high soil mobility with its adsorption being pH dependant (highest mobility at high soil pH) in the available batch soil adsorption studies. For the applied for representative uses FOCUS groundwater modelling indicates contamination of vulnerable groundwater at concentrations> 0.1 mu g/L (the parametric drinking water limit) is not expected for parent captan. However annual average concentrations of THPI and THPAM leaving the top 1m soil layer are predicted to be up to ca. 2.7 and 5.9 mu g/L respectively while for some scenarios values are still below the trigger 0.1 mu g/L. Groundwater non relevance assessments for these two metabolites were therefore triggered. However their contribution to the global exposure of the consumer to residues of captan and its metabolites is very limited. In natural surface waters captan exhibits very low persistence. It breaks down to form the major metabolites THPI in water (max. 51%AR) and sediment (max 41%AR), THPAM (max. 26%AR) in water only and tetrahydrophthalic acid (THPAI, max. 11.3%AR) in sediment only. A conservative estimate of the degradation rate of these metabolites indicates they exhibit moderate persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 of the cyclohexene label accounted for ca. 50%AR at 90 days whilst unextracted sediment residues accounted for 23-29%AR. Aqueous photolysis was not a significant mechanism for degradation. Should captan be included in Annex 1, Member States would need to address the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water for the soil metabolites THPI and THPAM in national assessments, as these routes of entry to surface water have not been adequately addressed for these soil metabolites in the available, peer reviewed EU level assessment. The acute and short term risk to birds and the acute risk to mammals from uptake of contaminated food items is low. A high long-term risk is indicated in the first tier risk assessment for insectivorous birds for all representative uses and for herbivorous mammals for the representative uses in pome fruit and peaches/nectarines. The expert meeting on ecotoxicology rejected some of the refinement steps suggested in the refined risk assessment presented in the addendum of January 2005. Hence, the risk to insectivorous birds is not sufficiently addressed on the basis of the peer reviewed data. Some indication was provided that no grass/weeds are available as a potential food source for herbivorous mammals in southern European countries. Therefore it is suggested that the risk to herbivorous mammals should be assessed at Member State level. The first tier risk assessment resulted in a low acute risk to birds and mammals from uptake of contaminated drinking water for all representative uses. A high short-term risk to birds was indicated for the representative uses in pome fruit (South EU) and peaches/nectarines and a high long-term risk to birds and mammals was indicated for all representative uses. The risk to the aquatic environment is high and risk mitigation measures such as no spray buffer zones of 5 m, 15 m and 20 m are required for the representative uses in tomatoes, pome fruit (North EU), pome fruit (South EU) and peaches/nectarines. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low for all representative uses. The long-term risk to earthworms based on laboratory studies could lead to a potential underestimation of the risk to earthworms under dry soil conditions. It is proposed that the long-term risk to earthworms is assessed at Member State level taking into account the particular soil conditions in the respective Member State. The risk to bees, other non-target arthropods, other soil non-target organisms, soil non-target microorganisms and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low for all representative uses.",NA
[Anonymous],Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pyriproxyfen,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.336r,"Pyriproxyfen is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(2). Pyriproxyfen was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on pyriproxyfen in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 24 November 2005. The peer review was initiated on 21 July 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in September - October 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in January 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in March 2009. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on protected tomato and aubergine(3) and field grown cotton. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points attached as Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Pyriproxyfen 10 EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin and in soil can be determined with a multi-method (The German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of pyriproxyfen. It should be noted that the residue definition for surface water is provisional. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The maximum level of two impurities in the specification was not supported by the available data. However, it should be noted that the specification was accepted by mammalian toxicology. The biological activity of the two isomers that make up pyriproxyfen has not been concluded on. Some spectra data, relative density, Henry's law constant, water solubility and partition coefficient were identified as data gaps. It should be noted however that new studies were submitted to address these data gaps but these could not be taken into account in view of the restrictions concerning the acceptance of new studies after the submission of the DAR to EFSA, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. Oxidising properties and details of the commercial packaging are outstanding issues for the formulated product. With regard to the mammalian toxicology, pyriproxyfen was of low acute toxicity in all tested species, and was neither a skin nor eye irritant, nor a skin sensitizer. After repeated administration, the main target organ was the liver, and slight changes were also observed in the haematological parameters. Negative results were obtained in gene mutation, chromosome aberration and DNA repair tests in vitro, as well as in vivo in a micronucleus test. No evidence of a carcinogenic potential was observed in long-term studies in rats and mice. No adverse effects were observed in the reproductive parameters during a multigeneration study with rats. In the developmental toxicity studies, no teratogenic effect was observed but developmental effects were present in rats at maternal toxic doses. A severe maternal toxicity was observed in both species at the high dose level. Considering the dog as the most sensitive species, the agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.1 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The same study was used to derive the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) with a correction for a limited oral absorption (40%), leading to a value of 0.04 mg/kg bw/day. Based on the low toxicity profile of pyriproxyfen, the derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary. The agreed dermal absorption values were 2.5% for the concentrate and 13% for the dilution. The exposure estimates for the operator are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment during outdoor and indoor application in Northern Europe, the indoor application in Southern Europe requires the use of personal protective equipment in order to have an exposure level below the AOEL according to the Dutch model for greenhouse use. Metabolism of pyriproxyfen was studied in the categories fruit and oilseed crops. The studies indicated that pyriproxyfen was more extensively metabolised in cotton than in tomato. Total residues were low in cotton seed and no major compound could be identified. In tomato, however, the major residue was found to be pyriproxyfen, with some minor metabolites detected. Processing data indicated that pyriproxyfen residues did not decay to form any significant degradation product. On the basis of a confined rotational crop study and soil dissipation data it was concluded that significant residues in rotational crops are unlikely to occur. The residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment for the representative uses was proposed as pyriproxyfen alone. A sufficient number of valid supervised residue trials with pyriproxyfen in tomato and cotton were submitted to support the respective notified uses. According to current guidance, the data on tomato can moreover be used to extrapolate to the notified use on aubergine. On the basis of the available residue data MRLs for pyriproxyfen of 0.3 mg/kg were proposed for tomato and aubergine, respectively, and at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the analytical method of 0.01 mg/kg for cotton seed. Residues in livestock feed are not expected to occur at significant levels. The only potential feed item used in current European feeding practice is cotton seed meal. However, residues in cotton seed and cotton seed meal were below the LOQ (0.01 mg/kg). An estimate of the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) of the consumer with the established MRLs resulted in chronic intakes well below the ADI (<2%) for all considered consumer groups including young children. Based on the low toxicity profile of pyriproxyfen an ARfD was considered not necessary. Therefore, an acute consumer risk assessment is not required. In soil under aerobic conditions pyriproxyfen exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the minor soil metabolites 4'-OH-pyr(4) (accounting for up to 6.3% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits moderate persistence and PYPAC(5) (accounting for up to 8.6 % AR) which exhibits very low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the phenoxyphenyl ring and 2,6-pyridyl labels to carbon dioxide accounted for 11-61% AR after 90-94 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 30-58 % AR after 90-122 days. Pyriproxyfen is immobile in soil, 4'-OH-pyr exhibits low to slight mobility in soil whilst PYPAC exhibits very high mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of either pyriproxyfen, 4'-OH-pyr or PYPAC was pH dependant. In a sterile laboratory aqueous photolysis study the major metabolite PYPA(6) was formed accounting for up to 70% AR. However as the rate of photolytic decline of pyriproxyfen in this study was slower than in natural sediment water systems where viable microorganisms were present, combined with the information that pyriproxyfen would be expected to partition rapidly to sediments in natural systems, it was concluded that under field conditions PYPA would not be expected to be formed in significant amounts. In dark natural sediment water systems pyriproxyfen partitioned to sediment and degraded exhibiting low persistence, to the metabolites 4'-OH-pyr in sediment, which exhibited very low to low persistence, PYPAC in water, which exhibited moderate to medium persistence, and to DPH-pyr(7) in water. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance accounting for a maxima of 1152 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a major sink representing 31-51 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for pyriproxyfen at steps 1-3. For the metabolites 4'-OH-Pyr, PYPAC, DPH-Pyr appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses by pyriproxyfen and the metabolites 4'-OH-pyr and PYPAC above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios when a single crop per calendar year is cultivated. The risk from uptake of pyriproxyfen from the diet, drinking water and secondary poisoning was assessed as low for birds and mammals for all intended uses. Pyriproxyfen was assessed as very toxic to aquatic organisms and not readily biodegradable (R50/53). A higher tier microcosm study was provided to address the risk to aquatic organisms. As insects were missing in the microcosm, a data gap was identified for the notifier to address the risk to aquatic insects before the aquatic risk assessment could be finalised for all intended uses. The application of an assessment factor to the microcosm endpoint should be considered when data on toxicity to insects are available. Bioaccumulation was considered to be of low concern. The risk to bees was assessed as low for the intended use on cotton, and the uses on tomato and aubergine in Northern European greenhouses. The risk to pollinators from the insect growth regulator mode of action, however, needs to be addressed further for greenhouse uses on tomato and aubergine in Southern Europe. The risk to soil non-target micro-organisms was not addressed due to the lack of valid studies. A new study was provided by the notifier and assessed by RMS in an addendum (December 2008), however this could not be considered in the peer review in view of the restrictions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. The risk to non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target macro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance penoxsulam,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.343r,"Penoxsulam is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC2 Italy received an application from Dow AgroScience for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006 and January 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in April 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on rice for the control of Echinochloa crus-galli, sedges and broad leaf weeds as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` penoxsulam DE-638' (GF-657), an oil dispersion (OD) containing 20.4 g/l of penoxsulam. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring for food/feed of plant origin and for environmental matrices. In the mammalian metabolism studies, penoxsulam was rapidly and almost completely absorbed upon oral administration. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation. Excretion was rapid, but dose and sex dependent as excretion was primarily observed via faeces in males and primarily excreted in urine in females. Penoxsulam was bio-transformed to a large number of metabolites; however the majority of the radioactivity was eliminated as unchanged parent compound. Plant and environmental metabolites BST4 and BSTCA5 were not identified in the rat metabolism studies. Toxicological information was lacking on the metabolite BSTCA to conclude on its relevance as a plant metabolite, moreover, it cannot be ruled out that BSTCA is also relevant according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater. The acute toxicity of penoxsulam was low by the oral, dermal and inhalation route; slight skin and eye irritation were observed, but no potential for skin sensitisation. The dog was found to be the most sensitive species with the kidneys as the main target organ; the overall short-term NOAEL in dogs was 18 mg/kg bw/day. Long-term toxicity reflected the same target organ observed in the short-term studies: the liver in mice and the kidneys in rats. The relevant long-term NOAEL was the dose level of 5 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. No potential for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No effect was seen on the reproductive performance and parameters; no developmental effect was observed either in rats. In rabbits, a slight increase in resorption rate parameters was associated with maternal toxicity, evidenced by gastro-intestinal upset and decreased body weight gain during the middle gestation. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of penoxsulam was 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year rat study and applying a safety factor of 100; the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) was 0.18 mg/kg bw/day based on the short-term dog studies and a safety factor of 100, no correction factor was needed to account for enteral resorption; no Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was allocated. Dermal absorption was 10% for both the concentrate and in-use spray dilution of the representative formulation. The level of operator exposure for a maximum application rate of 0.04 kg penoxsulam/ha in rice was below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to both the German7 and the UK POEM8 models. Worker and bystander exposure were considered negligible. A metabolism study in rice demonstrated that following foliar application of penoxsulam the total residues decreased rapidly to insignificant levels present at harvest of the crop. Therefore, the residue definition in rice grain was proposed as penoxsulam by default. In supervised residue trials penoxsulam was found to be always below the Limit of Quantification of 0.01 mg/kg in rice grain, while in rice straw residues ranged up to 0.08 mg/kg. Consequently, an MRL for grain was proposed at 0.01 mg/kg, which is the lowest validated level of the analytical method. For straw an MRL is not required. Rice may be grown in monoculture but also in rotation with other crops. A submitted confined crop rotation study showed that after a plant back interval of 90 days low residues could still be found in some crops. Other plant back intervals were not investigated. Moreover, a metabolite BSTCA, identified at significant levels in rotated crops, was neither found in primary crop metabolism nor in rat metabolism. The toxicological relevance of this metabolite for consumer risk assessment could not be addressed. As rotation practices in Member States seem to differ and the submitted data on rotational crops were limited, a final conclusion on the relevance of residues in rotated crops other than cereals could not be reached. Hence the experts agreed that further elaboration on the issue is required. A data requirement for further rotational crop data is proposed. If only the scenarios of rice grown in monoculture and of rice rotated with other cereals are considered it can be concluded that exposure to livestock is not expected to be significant. Under these conditions, on the basis of the submitted animal metabolism studies, residues in food of animal origin are expected to occur at extremely low levels that would not be appropriate for monitoring. The experts therefore agreed that, for the time being, it would not be necessary to propose a residue definition and MRLs for food of animal origin. However, it should be noted that the assessment is not finalised with regard to potential livestock exposure to residues in rotational crops other than cereals. Consumer exposure to residues of penoxsulam in rice grain is insignificant and thus in a chronic risk assessment intakes were well below to ADI. No acute assessment was conducted as an ARfD was not allocated. However, the consumer risk assessment cannot be finalised with regard to residues of metabolite BSTCA since a lack of sufficient occurrence data and toxicological data was identified. As BSTCA may also occur in drinking water derived from ground water at a level > 0.1 mu g/L, total consumer exposure to BSTCA has to be assessed in order to conclude on the consumer risk assessment. Based on the available environmental fate and behaviour studies in soil and 2 field studies in rice paddies, penoxsulam and the breakdown products 5-OH-penoxsulam (max 40.5% applied radioactivity (AR) in soil) and BSTCA (max 53% AR in soil), were concluded as requiring environmental exposure assessments. In a sterilised laboratory aqueous photolysis study TPSA, 2amino-TP and 5-OH-2-amino-TP12 were major metabolites but it was concluded that these did not need to be assessed, as though sought, they were not detected in relevant field studies in rice paddies. Penoxsulam and 5-OH-penoxsulam were characterised as exhibiting moderate persistence in soil with BSTCA exhibiting medium to high persistence. Additionally in aerobic natural sediment water systems the metabolites PCA-5-OH and OH-BSTCA were formed at up to 16% AR (sum of both compounds) in sediment, so exposure assessments were necessary for these metabolites and are available. In the aerobic laboratory incubations mineralisation of both the phenyl and the 2-triazolopyrimidine rings to carbon dioxide was low accounting for only 0.3-2.4 % AR after 99 to 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 10-16 % AR in aerobic soil (same radiolabels) after 120 days and 21-58 % AR in aerobic natural sediment water studies after 99 days. Penoxsulam was characterised as exhibiting high to medium mobility, 5-OH-penoxsulam high mobility and BSTCA very high to medium mobility. Further details are necessary regarding a refined higher tier surface water exposure assessment that included definitions of novel scenarios, not prescribed by EU MED-Rice (2003) guidance15. It can be concluded that the potential for penoxsulam or its metabolite 5-OH-penoxsulam to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L from the applied for intended uses is low. For the metabolite BSTCA the potential to contaminate vulnerable groundwater above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is low in situations represented by the MED-Rice clay scenario. However in situations represented by the MED-Rice sand scenario, BSTCA may be present in vulnerable groundwater at > 0. 1 mu g/L (calculations indicate concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L). Therefore a non-relevance assessment for BSTCA was triggered. In the risk assessment for birds, species representing insectivorous birds (wren), omnivorous birds eating large aquatic insects (mallard), omnivorous birds eating aquatic plants (mallard), large herbivorous birds (geese) and piscivorous birds (heron) were considered. All TER values were well above the relevant Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk to birds from the use of penoxsulam in rice paddies. Water vole (small herbivorous mammal), water shrew (eating aquatic invertebrates) and otter (eating fish and amphibians) were selected as focal species for the "" in-field"" risk assessment for mammals. The lowest TER obtained was 25 for the long-term risk to water vole. Since this was above the relevant Annex VI trigger a low risk was concluded. For both birds and mammals the exposure from intake of contaminated paddy water was included in the estimation of the daily dose by simply adding the drinking water dose to the dietary dose. The log P-ow for penoxsulam is <3 and also the surface water metabolites were considered to have a log P-ow<3, hence the potential for bioaccumulation and secondary poisoning was considered as low. Penoxsulam was classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The first tier risk assessment for algae and aquatic plants, based on PECsw in the ""off-field"" area, gave TERs of 46 and 2.9, respectively. An assessment was provided for fish and aquatic invertebrates in paddy water. No assessment was provided for algae or higher plants in paddy water, considering the herbicidal activity of penoxsulam. The lowest acute TER value was 202, which was obtained for Daphnia using the EC50 for the formulation. The lowest long-term TER was 83. It was concluded that the first tier risk to aquatic plants in the ""off-field"" area was high. Refinements based on a higher tier study with Lemna were not accepted in the peer review, and the risk to aquatic plants remains to be addressed. The risk to aquatic organisms from metabolites was addressed, as was the risk from bioaccumulation (log P-ow<3). The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil micro-organisms and non-target plants was assessed as low.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion regarding the focussed peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance chlorthal-dimethyl,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.202r,"Chlorthal-dimethyl is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State. Chlorthal is the ISO common name for tetrachloroterephthalic acid (IUPAC). Due to the fact that chlorthal-dimethyl, a variant of chlorthal, is used in the formulated product, it should be noted that the evaluated data belong to the variant chlorthal-dimethyl, unless otherwise specified. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on chlorthal-dimethyl in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 31 October 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 July 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant AMVAC Chemical UK Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. On 3 April 2008 the EFSA received an addendum to the DAR for the section on mammalian toxicology prepared by Greece, summarising studies, which had been available before the DAR was sent to the EFSA. Greece sent a copy of the addendum to the notifier on 21 July 2008 inviting the submission of comments by 15 September 2008. In accordance with Article 11c of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021, instead of requesting the organisation of a full peer review the EU-Commission asked the EFSA in a letter dated 4 June 2008 to focus on specific points including points related to criteria set out in Annex VI. These specific points were: The toxicology and in particular the proposed classification as a carcinogen category 3 The relevance of the metabolite MPA The amount of the metabolite MPA found in groundwater On 18 July 2008 the EFSA started the focussed peer review on the specific points by distributing the addendum of March 2008 to Member States and inviting comments. Comments were submitted by Sweden, Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark and France taking into account the evaluation of the studies summarised in the addendum of March 2008. These comments have been taken into consideration and were evaluated by the EFSA as summarised in the last column of the discussion table of the report of the focussed peer review. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of Member States took place during a written procedure in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The notifier's comments were only available after the legal deadline for the EFSA to issue the conclusion. By letter received on 31 October 2008 the EU Commission asked the EFSA to consider the notifier's comments and to amend the EFSA conclusion if necessary by 30 November 2008. The notifier submitted several comments, which were distributed to all Member States and discussed during a written procedure. Comments were submitted by France, Hungary and Greece and EFSA provided comments as well, as set out in Appendix 2 of the report on the focussed peer review. Conclusion: In agreement with the majority of the commenting Member States and the evaluation of the rapporteur Member State the EFSA concludes that - the proposed classification is agreed. and - the metabolite MPA must be considered relevant, and - the metabolite MPA leaches to groundwater above 0.1 mu g/L in all scenarios. The information presented in the addendum and the comments presented by the notifier do not change the overall conclusion drawn by the rapporteur Member State in the DAR on the section of mammalian toxicology, as the majority of Member States confirmed that the studies presented (from 1963) are not adequate for the purpose of clarifying the carcinogenic properties of the active substance. For the section on fate and behaviour in the environment no additional data were submitted in the addendum. According to the conclusions of the DAR, the active substance is proposed to be classified as Carc. Cat. 3. No convincing evidence has been provided that the metabolite MPA will not lead to any risk of carcinogenicity, therefore it must be considered relevant. According to the evaluation presented in the DAR for the section on fate and behaviour the metabolite MPA exceeds the concentration in the groundwater of 0.1 mu g/L in all scenarios. Chlorthal-dimethyl clearly fulfils the Annex VI criteria of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide to control grasses and annual dicotyledonous weeds on strawberry and ornamentals as proposed by the notifier.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance lenacil,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1326,"Lenacil is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. Lenacil was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as, the Regulation.). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as, the Commission.) in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on lenacil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 30 November 2007. The peer review was initiated on 08 January 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Schirm GmbH. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues, as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request, were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in sugar beet and fodder beet for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Venzar 80 WP., a wettable powder (WP) containing 800 g/kg lenacil, registered under different trade names in Europe. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible, however data gaps were identified for the determination of the accelerated storage stability and sprayability. Adequate methods are available to monitor lenacil residues in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water however data gaps were identified for a confirmatory method for the determination of residues in water and for a residue method for air with a LOQ of at least 48 mu g/m3. It should also be noted that following the finalization of the residue definition for monitoring for soil, surface water and ground water, data gaps might have to be set for methods capable of analysing for the compounds in the residue definitions. In mammals, lenacil is not acutely toxic via oral, dermal or inhalation routes; it is not a skin or eye irritant or skin sensitiser. In the short-term toxicity studies the rats and dogs were the most sensitive species showing alterations in the liver and thyroid function: the relevant oral No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 40.6 mg/kg bw/day and 44 mg/kg bw/day (rats and dogs, respectively; 13-week studies). Lenacil is unlikely to be genotoxic. Increased incidence of malignant mammary adenocarcinoma were observed in rats and considered to be of relevance for humans. In mice, increased incidences of lung single alveolar tumours (adenoma and carcinoma) and multiple liver adenomas were observed and were considered of equivocal relevance for humans. Based on mammary gland and lung tumours, the classification Carc. cat. 3, R40, Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect. was proposed. The relevant NOAEL from the long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is 12 mg/kg bw/day (rat study). No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats: the relevant parental NOAEL is 81.9 mg/kg bw/day, the offspring NOAEL is 1727 mg/kg bw/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 4300 mg/kg bw/day. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, lenacil did not cause malformations in the rat and rabbits: the relevant maternal NOAEL in both species is 1000 mg/kg bw/day; the relevant developmental NOAELs are 1000 and 4000 mg/kg bw/day in rat and rabbits respectively (highest dose level tested). The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.12 mg/kg bw/day was derived from the chronic rat study applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. An Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was considered not needed. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.4 mg/kg bw/day (rounded) was based on the 13-week rat study supported by the 13-week dog study with a safety factor of 100. The operator exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL even without the use of personal protective equipment (German Model) and with gloves during mixing and loading and application (UK POEM Model). Worker and bystander exposure were estimated to be below the AOEL. The metabolism of lenacil was investigated in sugar beet. Besides lenacil, the metabolite IN-KC9434 formed by hydroxylation in the 7 position of lenacil and its glucosides and non-identified polar metabolites were found in sugar beet leaves. Since the most prevalent residue found in sugar beet metabolism was lenacil, the following residue definition was proposed for monitoring and risk assessment for root crops: lenacil only. A sufficient data base of residue trials from Northern and Southern Europe was submitted to propose an MRL for sugar beet (roots). Metabolism studies on rotational crops are not available. Based on the DT90 values found for the degradation of lenacil in soil in field studies, the PRAPeR experts meeting decided that metabolism studies on rotational crops are necessary to support the notified use. Dietary burden calculations showed intake of lenacil residues through sugar or fodder beet roots and leaves slightly above the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg feed. The PRAPeR experts meeting concluded that the intake was probably overestimated. Therefore, the majority of experts agreed that livestock metabolism studies should not be required. A chronic dietary intake estimate was carried out by the rapporteur Member State. The TMDI was below 0.4% of the ADI for all considered consumer groups. An acute dietary intake estimate was not carried out as no ARfD was set. In soil under aerobic conditions lenacil exhibits moderate to medium persistence forming the major soil metabolites IN-KF 3135 (accounting for up to 14.7% of applied radioactivity (AR)), IN-KE 1216 (accounting for up to 13.9% AR), unidentified metabolite, Polar B. (accounting for up to 14.6% AR) and the unidentified, Polars. (accounting for up to 12.5% AR). The proper characterisation of, Polar B. and, polars. or the assessments of the exposure of environment to these compounds were not available. Metabolite IN-KE 121 exhibits low to moderate persistence, while metabolite IN-KF 313 exhibits moderate to very high persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide of the applied [ 4,7a14C2]- lenacil accounted for 47.6-61.1% AR after 120 days (expressed as volatile compounds, which presumably consisted of mainly carbon dioxide). The formations of unextractable residues were a sink, accounting for 19.4-25.8% AR after 120 days. Lenacil exhibits medium to high mobility in soil. IN-KF 313 exhibits low to high, while IN-KE 121 exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either parent lenacil or the metabolites IN-KF 313 and IN-KE 121 was pH dependent. However the adsorption potential of IN-KF 313 was studied only in a narrow range of soil pH. In natural sediment water systems lenacil exhibited high persistence (total system DT50 122-103 days) degrading to the major metabolite IN-KF 313 (maximum 7.8% AR in the water phase and 10.7% in the sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a minimal sink in the material balance accounting for only 3.8-4.8% AR at the study end. Residues not extracted from sediment accounted for 10.616.5% AR at study end. The necessary FOCUS surface water and sediment exposure assessments did not use exactly appropriate substance input parameters. However it was accepted that the available estimates could be used for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios by lenacil or IN-KE 121. No acceptable FOCUS simulations were available for the metabolite IN-KF 313. Based on the results of the available, non-agreed simulations, where the used degradation parameter was too favourable for this metabolite, in geoclimatic regions represented by Piacenza FOCUS groundwater scenario, contamination of groundwater above the 0.1 mu g/L limit cannot be excluded. In a lysimeter study neither lenacil nor the known metabolites IN-KF 313 and IN-KE 121 were found in the leachates, but the annual average of the unidentified fractions, M1, M2 and M3 were present in the leachates above 0.1 mu g/L. The risk to non-target species (i. e. birds and mammals, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro-and micro-organisms, other non-target organisms, and biological methods for sewage treatment) was expected to be low, except for aquatic organisms. Algae and aquatic plants were the most sensitive organisms, and the effects were further assessed in higher tier studies. In particular, an outdoor microcosm field study on primary productivity and macrophytes was considered valid. This study showed several deficiencies, but it indicated a potential higher sensitivity of macrophytes and algae than the first-tier studies, therefore the experts considered it relevant for risk assessment. The experts agreed to consider the NOEC, expressed as measured concentration, as the most appropriate endpoint from this study, to be used with a safety factor of 2-5. However, a NOEC could not be finalised for either macrophytes or algae, and consequently it was not possible to finalise the risk assessment. A data gap was identified to address the sensitivity of Charophyta (the most sensitive species found in the microcosm study) and of algae. These further data should allow to define the endpoint from the outdoor microcosm study to be used for risk assessment.",NA
NA,"Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene European Food Safety Authority",2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1341,"(EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene3 is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20004, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20025. This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 16 January 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 10 May 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force, which originally consisted of Dow AgroScience B. V. and BASF Agro B. V. BASF sold the business of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene to Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA on 17 December 2003 and therefore was replaced in the Task Force. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 8 November 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 8 February 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72). Following the Commission Decision of 20 September 2007 (2007/619/EC) 6 concerning the noninclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants, Dow AgroScience B. V. and Kanesho Soil Treatment BVBA made a resubmission application for the inclusion of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene in Annex I, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20087. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (European Commission, 2007) as follows:. A finalised assessment of consumer exposure. The environmental fate and ecotoxicology of the substance. Lack of data on the persistency, toxicological behaviour, uptake from crops, accumulation, metabolic fate and residue level of certain polychlorinated impurities and concerns were identified with regard to:. The potential contamination of groundwater. The consumer exposure. The risk to birds, mammals and aquatic organisms. Its possible impact on non-target organisms In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene in the format of an Additional Report (Spain, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 15 April 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 25 May 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 2 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific telephone conferences with Member State experts in September 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all areas. The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide as proposed by the applicants. The application to bare soil comprises either introduction of the formulated product into the drip irrigation system ("" EF-1478"") or soil injection at 15-20 cm depth ("" XRM-5048"") to control nematodes in soil where tomatoes or peppers will be grown. The application rates are up to 283 kg (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene per hectare ("" EF-1478"") and up to 224 kg per hectare ("" XRM-5048""), respectively. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene can be used as nematicide, insecticide, fungicide and herbicide, depending on the dose rate used. In general, an application of (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene by soil injection and/or drip irrigation is followed by partial sterilisation of the soil. It should be noted that the applicants stated that only the use as a nematicide would be supported in the EU review programme. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative use as a nematicide. The representative formulated products for the evaluation under the resubmission were the same as for the original submission, ` Telone EC Drip (EF-1478)', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), registered under different trade names in Southern European countries, and ` Telone Injected (XRM-5048)' a liquid formulation (AL), registered under different trade names in the EU. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropopene is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised in the rat. The acute oral and dermal toxicity is high and the inhalatory toxicity is moderate, proposed classification and risk phrases are T; R24/25 "" Toxic in contact with and if swallowed"" and R20 "" Harmful by inhalation"". It is a skin irritant and sensitizer, proposed classification and risk phrases are R38 "" Irritant to skin"" and R43 "" May cause sensitization by skin contact"". According to medical data 1,3-dichloropopene should also be classified as irritant to eyes and to the respiratory system, proposed classification and risk phrases are R36/R37 "" Irritating to eyes and respiratory system"" and R65 "" May cause lung damage if swallowed"". The Technical Committee for Classification and Labelling in 2005 agreed not to classify 1,3-D as mutagenic or carcinogenic, unless epichlorhydrin (a known carcinogen) had been used as a stabiliser. The applicants confirmed that the current product is not stabilised with epichlorhydrin. No reproduction toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. The metabolites (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol8 and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid9 are both toxic. Dependent on the identity on the polychlorinated impurities, it might be necessary to require new toxicological studies. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.025 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of the safety factor of 100. The systemic Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.1 mg/kg bw/day, safety factor 100. As inhalation exposure is the main route of exposure and all data from operator exposure are expressed as atmospheric concentration (mg/m3), an additional inhalatory human AOEC was assigned which is 0.45 mg/m3. The ARfD is 0.2 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 added. The operator and worker exposure during drip irrigation activities is below the AOEL with the use of PPE and RPE; the estimated exposure levels for a bystander at > 7 m from the site of application are below the AOEC, however at closer distances estimated exposure levels exceed the AOEC. During soil injection activities the operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates show levels below the AOEC (operator and worker wearing PPE and RPE). The degradation and metabolism of 1,3-D has been studied comparatively in fruit (tomatoes and citrus), root vegetables (sugar beet), pulses and oilseeds (soybeans) following application of radiolabelled material to the soil surrounding the tree, or to the soil in which seeds were planted. Additional information from succeeding crop studies is given on leafy crops (lettuce) and cereals (wheat). Even though a high amount of applied 1,3-D is expected to volatilise from soil, the results of the available studies indicate that 1,3-D is also absorbed into plants, translocated and degraded. Naturally occurring plant constituents contained the majority of radioactivity recovered in edible plant parts, indicating complete metabolism of 1,3-D. Consequently, no 1,3-D residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) are expected to be present in primary or succeeding crops. This was confirmed by supervised residue trials data. In the resubmission dossier of 2009 a number of additional residue trials were provided to allow some further clarification with regard to manufacturing process impurities that are applied to the soil in high amounts when 1,3-D is used at the notified application rate. 1,3-D and six impurities (1, 2, 3, 5b, 5c and 8a) were analysed. 1,3-D and its six studied impurities did not leave detectable residues in the crop. However, even though potential chronic and acute dietary exposure to residues of 1,3-D per se from tomatoes and peppers is well below the ADI (< 10%) and ARfD (< 2%), respectively the consumer risk assessment cannot be considered as finalised in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities. The consumer risk assessment is pending a conclusion on the fate and behaviour of these 11 identified impurities in the environment, and/or with regard to toxicological data on manufacturing process impurities in the updated specification in the section on mammalian toxicology. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene is a volatile liquid, so even though it is injected below the soil surface or applied via drip irrigation systems, the major route of dissipation from soil is volatilisation to the air. In aerobic laboratory soil studies it exhibited low to moderate persistence and formed the major (> 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid which exhibited very low to moderate persistence and the minor (< 10% AR) degradation product (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited very low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 11-37% AR at 49-77 days. At these times unextracted soil residue accounted for 9-28% AR. In laboratory soil batch adsorption studies (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited very high to high mobility. (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid exhibited very high soil mobility. In a laboratory study on a natural sediment water system (25 degrees C) with dosing under the water surface, volatilisation was again the major route of dissipation of (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene from the systems. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene exhibited low persistence and formed the minor (< 10% applied radioactivity, AR) degradation products (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid and (EZ)-3-chloroallyl alcohol which exhibited low persistence. Mineralisation to CO2 accounted for 57% AR at 21 days. At this time unextracted sediment residues accounted for 14% AR. Acceptable surface aquatic system PEC are only available. FOCUS groundwater 'tier I' modelling indicates that at the spatial scale usually assessed of the treated field, there is a very high potential for the contamination of groundwater by parent (EZ)-1,3dichloropropene and (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid. The results from an extensive targeted EU groundwater monitoring program are available. With the exception of the monitored areas in France, where critical details regarding the program are missing, this program indicates for the historical intensity of use of 1,3-D in the monitored areas, at the points of drinking water abstraction that were sampled, groundwater contamination by parent (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene > 0.1 mu g/L had not occurred. Contamination above this level by (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid had occurred but rarely (2 samples from different wells out of the 50 taken in the Spanish region of Caceres where the concentrations were 0.116 and 0.413 mu g/L). In all other monitored wells (92) (EZ)-3-chloroacrylic acid was < 0.1 mu g/L. It has been concluded that there is information missing that is needed to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment in relation to 11 manufacturing process impurities. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene volatilises from soil even though it is applied below the soil surface. The flux losses from the soil have been measured in field studies in the USA that have been assessed as being representative for EU conditions. Member State experts' and the EFSA considered sufficient information has been provided to conclude that the (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene that will reach the upper atmosphere will degrade relatively rapidly and that this compound and its potential atmospheric degradation products are unlikely to have an adverse effect on the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, as they will be relatively short lived in this environmental compartment. For 10 manufacturing process impurities, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) calculations, on the rate of photo-oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radicals in the upper atmosphere, indicate that these impurities could be subject to long range transport through the atmosphere. Studies to address the data gaps identified in the EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 72 were provided for the resubmission. Confirmatory data on the compliance of the ecotoxicological test batches to the new specifications are still missing. The indoor use in glasshouse is defined as a permanent structure to which entry of birds and mammals is limited and hence the risk to birds and mammals for the indoor uses is regarded to be low. A high acute risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous birds and mammals and a long-term risk to earthworm-eating and insectivorous mammals was identified for the outdoor uses. The risk was addressed in a refined risk assessment for herbivorous, insectivorous and earthworm-eating birds and mammals, based on worst case concentrations from residue studies in plants, insects and earthworms. All TER values for acute, short-term and long-term risk meet Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk to birds and mammals from the intended outdoor use. Available data indicated a similar level of aquatic toxicity for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene and 3chloroallyl alcohol to fish and Daphnia which was higher that the toxicity of 3-chloroacrylic acid. (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene was however less toxic to algae and Lemna than the two metabolites, which had a similar toxicity. Based on the acute endpoints both the active substance and the metabolites should be classified as very toxic to the aquatic environment. The EFSA Scientific Report (2006) concluded that the acute and long term risk to aquatic organisms from the indoor use via drip irrigation could be regarded as low without the need for risk mitigation measures. The risk associated with this use will therefore not be considered further. For the outdoor use the risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low based on CHAIN-2D CODE model exposure data including 3 m buffer zones for (EZ)-1,3-dichloropropene, 3-chloroallyl alcohol and 3-chloroacrylic acid. Extended laboratory studies on Folsomia candida, Hypoaspis aculeifer, Poecilus cupreus, Pardosa spp. and Aleochara bilineata are available but have several deficiencies (exposure method, late introduction of test species and lack of positive control product). In addition a field study was considered to inadequate (poor test design). A new field study from North Italy assessing the effect of telone II on arthropods and earthworms indicated no significant effects on arthropods. Transient effects on earthworms were observed, lasting less than 6 months post-treatment. Several shortcomings in the field study were however identified (e. g. use of other pesticides, low collection rate of collembolan and earthworms). Member state experts agreed that the new field study should only be used to refine the risk assessment for the intended use (tomatoes and soil injection) and only in case the statistical power of the field study could be confirmed. A high acute risk to earthworms was observed. The risk may be addressed by the field study mentioned above. However, the statistical power of the study still needs to be confirmed. The applicant provided a supportive study on abundance and diversity of earthworms in South Europe. Field surveys in November and February indicated low number of earthworms in fields potential treated with soil fumigants. The risk to non-target soil micro-organisms was assessed as low based on higher tier field studies. Buffer zones of 3 m were required to address the risk to non-target plants. It could not be excluded that 1,3-D might be harmful if the waste water goes to sewage treatment plants. A concern was raised that washing water from cleaning tools should not be disposed into surface water due to effects on activated sludge.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance proquinazid European Food Safety Authority,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1350,"Proquinazid is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC3 The United Kingdom received an application from DuPont de Nemours for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2004/686/EC4. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State The United Kingdom made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on proquinazid, hereafter referred to as the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), available on 14 March 2006. The peer review was initiated on 9 June 2006 by distributing the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April -May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the experts' discussions took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprise foliar spraying to cereals and grapes against powdery mildew. Full details of the GAPs can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` Proquinazid 200 g/L EC', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), containing 200 g/L proquinazid, registered under different trade names in the EU. There is no agreed technical specification at the moment. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin and environmental matrices. However, if MRLs will be set in food of animal origin according to the proposed residue definition for monitoring, an analytical method for the determination of the compounds in the residue definition will be required. In mammals, proquinazid is of low acute toxicity to rats following oral, dermal or inhalation exposure; it is not a skin or eye irritant nor a skin sensitiser. The relevant short term toxicity NOAELs are 2 mg/kg bw/day in rat (based on altered thyroid homeostasis and associated follicular cell hypertrophy) and < 15 mg/kg bw/day in the dog (increased incidence of clear ocular discharge). Proquinazid did not show any genotoxic potential. The relevant NOAEL for long term toxicity is 1.2 mg/kg bw/day from a rat study, based on thyroid and hepatic hyperplasia. Proquinazid was proposed for classification as R40 ""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"" based on increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in rats (equivocal evidence in mice) and also an increased incidence of intestinal-type cholangiocarcinomas in rats. Both tumours were considered of limited relevance for human risk assessment. Proquinazid did not cause substance-related effects on reproductive parameters or organs in adult rats. The parental and reproductive NOAELs are 2 mg/kg bw/day and 35 mg/kg bw/day respectively. The offspring NOAEL is 11 mg/kg bw/day based on reduced litter weight. Proquinazid is not a developmental toxicant: the maternal and developmental NOAELs are 30 mg/kg bw/day (rat) and 2.5 mg/kg bw/day (rabbit), respectively. Proquinazid is not neurotoxic. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL from the 2-year study in rat, with a safety factor of 100; the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.2 mg/kg bw (from the 90-day oral study in dog, SF 100); the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the NOAEL of 2 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rats, SF 100. The operator exposure to proquinazid is below the AOEL even without PPE (for the German model only), as well as for workers and bystanders. Metabolism of proquinazid was investigated in grapes and in wheat under outdoor field conditions. Based on the available data, the main metabolic reactions in the metabolism of proquinazid in wheat plants and grapes could be established. The significant residues in the various wheat fractions were proquinazid and the metabolite IN-MW9775 that was a major metabolite. In/on grape berries, proquinazid was only slowly metabolised to form minor amounts of IN-MM6716 and IN-MM9917. Thus, the overall picture of metabolism was found to be slightly different in wheat and grapes. To confirm the identity of a significant unextractable fraction as lignin, a metabolism study in apples was evaluated in an addendum but not peer reviewed. The proposed residue definition for consumer risk assessment for cereals and grapes is proquinazid and metabolite IN-MW977. Since the toxicological reference values of proquinazid can be applied to metabolite IN-MW977, residues of proquinazid and metabolite IN-MW977 should be expressed as proquinazid. The proposed residue definition for plant products for enforcement monitoring for cereals and grapes is proquinazid alone. A conversion factor of 2 was established for cereals and of 1 for grapes as INMW977 was not formed in grapes. A sufficient number of supervised residue trials are available in Northern and Southern Europe to support the representative uses on cereals and on grapes. The residue levels obtained in both Northern Europe and Southern Europe were similar. MRLs could be proposed for the different cereal crops barley, rye wheat, oats, triticale and for grapes. The trials are supported by valid storage stability data and validated analytical methods. In a rotational crop study significant total residues were detected in feed items, e.g. soybean straw and wheat forage and straw, while residues were < 0.01 mg/kg in crop parts for human consumption. The experts in PRAPeR 70 considered in particular that metabolite IN-MM671 is very persistent in soil and that it may accumulate in soil. Further assessment by the RMS was required, but the evaluation provided is not peer reviewed. Therefore a final peer reviewed conclusion on whether significant amounts of metabolites may be expected in succeeding crops (mainly feed items) could not be drawn. The metabolism and distribution of proquinazid was investigated in goats and in hen. Exposure to goats is significant. It was agreed that the following residue definition in animal matrices should be proposed for risk assessment: Sum of proquinazid and metabolites IN-MU2108 and IN-MW977 expressed as proquinazid. It was further agreed that for monitoring, the following residue definition in animal matrices should be proposed: Sum of proquinazid and metabolite IN-MU210, expressed as proquinazid. Residues are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg in animal products, considering the animal intake from the notified representative uses, however risk managers may consider to set MRLs for a fat-soluble residue in food of animal origin on the LOQ of the analytical method for monitoring. In a consumer risk assessment it could be demonstrated that chronic and acute dietary intake of a range of consumer groups is well below the toxicological reference values ADI and ARfD, respectively. Proquinazid exhibits moderate to high persistence in soil under aerobic conditions. The only major metabolite in the laboratory studies was IN-MM671. This metabolite is highly persistent in soil under aerobic conditions in the study performed with the parent compound and medium persistent in soil when applied as parent. Another metabolite, IN-MM991 was observed in one of the soils at levels above 5 % AR in two consecutive sampling dates. This metabolite is moderately persistent in soil. Metabolite IN-MM9869 was also observed as a minor metabolite in soil and is moderately persistent. A water/sediment study under dark anaerobic conditions was provided as a surrogate of the soil anaerobic study. Proquinazid exhibits medium persistence in this study. The same metabolites identified under aerobic conditions were found. Degradation of proquinazid was significantly enhanced by the irradiation of a light source simulating midday June sunlight in Phoenix, Arizona. Metabolite IN-MM671 was the main metabolite. Dissipation of proquinazid was investigated in four field dissipation studies in a total of eight European sites (2 in UK, 2 in Northern France, 2 in Southern France, 1 in Italy, 1 in Germany). All field dissipation trials were performed on bare soil, therefore the contribution of photolysis to a certain extent may not be excluded. The metabolites IN-MM671, IN-MM991 and IN-MM986 appeared at levels above 10 % AR at various sampling points in the radiolabelled study. In non radiolabelled trials, only IN-MM671 and IN-MM986 were found consistently above 10 % of the applied amount. In these trials, proquinazid was low to medium persistent in soil, IN-MM671 was moderately to very highly persistent in soil, IN-MM986 was moderately to medium persistent and IN-MM991 moderately persistent to highly persistent. According the results of the batch adsorption/desorption studies proquinazid may be considered immobile in soil, IN-MM671 slightly mobile, IN-MM991 medium to highly mobile and IN-MM986 slightly to low mobile in soil. Proquinazid and all the metabolites investigated were stable to hydrolysis (pH 4, 7 and 9). In the aqueous photolysis study proquinazid is rapidly photolysed (DT50 < 1 h). Major photolysis metabolites identified were IN-MM671, IN-MM991, IN-MM986 and IN-MT884(10). According to the available study, proquinazid is not readily biodegradable. In water/sediment systems, proquinazid partitioned rapidly into the sediment (DissT50 < 1 d). However, it is moderately to highly persistent in the total system. The only metabolite identified was IN-MM671, which is very highly persistent in both systems. However this metabolite is strongly absorbed to the sediment and only amounts up to 6 % AR (after 30 d) are found in the water phase. PECSW were calculated by the applicant following FOCUS SW scheme. Potential groundwater contamination by proquinazid and its main soil metabolites was addressed with FOCUS GW PELMO 3.3.2. The concentrations of proquinazid and the metabolites IN-MM671, INMM991 and IN-MM986 were < 0.001. g /L for all the uses and scenarios simulated. No atmospheric long range transport is expected for proquinazid because the calculated half-life for photochemical oxidative degradation in the atmosphere was calculated to be 4 h. Tier I assessment provided TER values above the Annex VI trigger values for the acute and short-term risk to birds. The long-term TER values were above the Annex VI trigger value for insectivorous and herbivorous birds for the use in cereals, whereas the TER for insectivorous birds for the use in vine failed to meet the trigger. The potential long-term risk for insectivorous birds in vine was refined by considering Yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) and Cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), and their respective diets, as focal species. A mean of the 'Residue unit dose' for small and large insects was used and the resulting TERlt for insectivorous birds was above the trigger values. The acute and longterm risk to mammals was considered to be low. The most likely exposure route for the metabolites would be through ingestion of contaminated earthworms or fish. Just the parent proquinazid and the metabolite IN-MM671 were considered for the assessment of secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals. Risk to earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals for cereals, was considered to be low. The high risk identified for the fish-eating birds for vine was refined using the 21 days TWA PECsw from FOCUSsw step 3. With the available information the risk for the earthworm-eating birds following the use of proquinazid in vines could not be considered as low. The risk from uptake of contaminated water was considered to be low. Proquinazid was considered to be very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute risk to aquatic organisms was addressed at FOCUSsw step 2, without risk mitigation for the use in cereals. Risk mitigation measures equivalent to a 5 m non-spray buffer zone were needed to address the acute risk to aquatic organism from the use in vines. For the long-term risk, TER values were below the Annex VI trigger values. FOCUS Step 4 calculations showed that non-spray buffer zones of 3 and 16 m for the use of proquinazid in cereals and vine respectively are necessary to protect the aquatic environment in the worst case scenarios. The risk of the relevant metabolites (IN-MM671, IN-MM986, IN-MM991) to aquatic organisms was considered to be low. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil non-target micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbosulfan,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1354,"Carbosulfan is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/2000i3 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on carbosulfan in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 11 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 17 August 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation to the Member States and the sole applicant FMC Chemical sprl. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. Following the Commission Decision of 16 June 2007 (2007/415/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of carbosulfan in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the notifier FMC made a resubmission application for the inclusion of carbofuran in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report as follows: the consumer exposure, the risk to ground water, operator exposure, risk to birds and mammals, risk to aquatic organisms, risk to bees, earthworms, non target arthropods and nontarget micro-organisms and plants. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on Carbosulfan in the format of an Additional Report (Belgium, 2009a). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 13 May 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 18 May 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 16 June 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 20 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the RMS' evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific telephone conferences with Member State experts in September 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in all areas. The original conclusion from the review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as an insecticide on sugar beet. The use on maize in the original conclusion has not been supported in the resubmitted dossier under Commission Regulation (EC) 33/2008. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points. Carbosulfan can be used as an insecticide and nematicide. It should be noted that during the peer review process only the use as an insecticide was evaluated. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Marshal 10G"", a granule (GR), registered in some Member States of the EU. It should be noted that the applicant no longer supports the second formulation, presented in the dossier and DAR (""Marshal 25CS""). Consequently also the uses on citrus and cotton are no longer supported. In the resubmitted dossier the applicant proposed a reduced application rate on sugar beet. This was rejected by the RMS as it was not considered a representative use. There are methods available to monitor all compounds given in the respective provisional residue definitions for food of plant and animal origin, body fluids and tissues, however data gaps were identified for additional validation data for the hydrolysis step of the monitoring methods for plant matrices and for an ILV. If MRLs are to be set for animal products in the future then validation of the hydrolysis step in the methods would be needed. For the environmental matrices sufficient methods are available for soil, for water the LOQ is not low enough for drinking water and also the method does not analyse for 3-keto-carbofuran for drinking and surface water. For air there is no method for carbofuran available (see data gap). Published multi-residue methods allowing determination of all compounds included in the proposed residue definitions in all matrix groups are not available. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Carbosulfan is toxic if swallowed and should be classified as T, R25 ""Toxic if swallowed"". It is of low toxicity via dermal route and toxic via inhalation (classification as T, R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" is proposed). Carbosulfan is not a skin or eye irritant but is a skin sensitiser and should be classified R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". Carbosulfan gave negative results in the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and did not show any carcinogenic potential. In the three-generation rat study, the relevant parental and reproductive NOAEL was 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, the relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw/day. Carbosulfan displayed no potential for induced delayed neurotoxicity. In acute and subchronic neurotoxicity studies in rat decreased brain acetylcholinesterase activity was the critical finding, being the acute NOAEL 0.5 mg/kg bw and the subchronic NOAEL 1.2 mg/kg bw/day. All three reference values are based on the acute neurotoxicity study: ADI, AOEL and ARfD are 0.005 mg/kg bw/day, applying a safety factor of 100. According to the PHED model calculations, operator exposure is below the AOEL when operators use gloves during the loading and application operations. It is considered that bystander and worker exposure is likely to be negligible under the supported conditions of use. Based on all available data the metabolic pathway of carbosulfan in soil applied uses can be considered as sufficiently investigated. Carbosulfan on one hand and the sum of carbofuran, 3-hydroxy-carbofuran and 3-keto carbofuran and their conjugates on the other hand were considered the relevant residues to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. However, a need to fully address residues and in particular their identity in succeeding crops was identified. Supervised residue trials in sugar beet, indicated that residues were very low (between LOQ and LOD) and in all submitted trials below the LOQ. However, data to demonstrate the analytical method used in the residue trials has efficiently determined conjugated residues is still necessary in order to validate the residue data. In livestock, carbosulfan undergoes an extensive metabolisation. 3-hydroxy-carbofuran and 3-keto-carbofuran free and conjugated were considered the relevant residue in animal matrices to assess consumer exposure and consumer risk. On the basis of available data the ratio of free and the conjugated residues in animal matrices could not be established, and therefore it was proposed to include the conjugates of 3-hydroxy carbofuran in the animal residue definition for monitoring. It has to be elaborated whether residues of 3-keto carbofuran (free and conjugated) can be taken into account by a conversion factor, or need to be included in the residue definition for monitoring. The RMS has provided a comprehensive dietary exposure and risk assessment for consumers using both the EFSA PRIMo and the UK model for a review by the experts, which can be considered being indicative. The sum of intakes of carbofuran and 3-hydroxy carbofuran from the primary crop, rotational crops and food of animal origin was estimated and compared to the toxicological reference values for carbofuran. An exceedance of the ADI was noted for UK toddlers. Moreover, the acute consumer risk assessment indicates the ARfD is significantly exceeded for a number of crops, mainly succeeding crops, consumed by children and by adults/the general population. The results highlight the importance of further residue data on succeeding crops to enable refinement of the dietary risk assessment for consumers. In order to further refine the risk assessment a data gap was identified for the applicant to address the residue levels of the carbamate structured metabolites in sugar. To mitigate the identified risk it was moreover suggested to restrict crop rotation to cereals only, but further data and assessment of the proposed scenario will be necessary. Based on the available data no further refinement of the consumer risk assessment is currently possible. EFSA notes that significant contribution to the acute and chronic exposure might be expected through drinking water derived from groundwater if any restrictions that might be considered to mitigate leaching of residues of carbofuran were not effective. In soil under laboratory aerobic conditions, carbosulfan yields carbofuran (max. 48.7 % -69.3 % AR after 3-7 d). Also 3-keto-carbofuran is produced in significant amounts (max. 5.3 % -6.6 %) and needs to be further assessed as it contains the active carbamate moiety, as the minor transient metabolite 3-OH-carbofuran. The mineralization was very limited and bounded residues increased up to maximum of 90 % AR after 100 d. In a study performed with 14C-dibutylamine labelled carbosulfan, dibutylamine was found as a major aerobic soil metabolite. No valid degradation study of carbosulfan in soil under anaerobic conditions is available. Also photolysis in soil was not investigated. Metabolite carbofuran was considered stable to photolysis in soil in its DAR. Evaluation meeting agreed that a re-evaluation of the degradation kinetic in degradation studies had to be performed. Reassessments and new degradation studies for the metabolites are available in the additional report. Carbosulfan exhibited very low to low persistence, while carbofuran exhibited low to high persistence. Metabolite carbofuran-phenol (another minor soil metabolite, but major in water/sediment systems) and 3-OHcarbofuran exhibited very low persistence, while 3-keto-carbofuran and dibutylamine exhibited very low to low persistence. Summaries of some field dissipation studies in EU are available. Half life of carbosulfan in these trials ranges between 0.35 to 9.8 d, half life of carbofuran is between 1.3 to 27 d and half life of dibutylamine is between 2.2-54 days. EFSA notes that, in the context of the carbofuran discussion, the meeting of MS experts was not able to determine the reliability of these studies. PEC in soil were calculated in the additional report for carbosulfan, carbofuran and dibutylamine based on the field worst case half lives and the representative uses in sugar beet. Based on new studies that are evaluated in the additional report, carbosulfan is classified as immobile compound. 3-hydroxy-carbofuran exhibits very high to high mobility and 3-keto-carbofuran exhibits very high to low mobility in soil, while carbofuran-phenol exhibits medium to low mobility. For the metabolite carbofuran an acceptable study (from a different notifier Dianica) is available in its dossier as active substance. Carbofuran is classified as very high mobile compound. A lysimeter study is available. However, annual average concentrations and detailed characterization of the residue are missing. Two new lysimeter studies performed with carbofuran were submitted and assessed, but were regarded as non-conclusive studies. Carbosulfan hydrolyses with half lives lower than 1 d at pH 5 and 7 and of 7 d at pH 9. Main products are carbofuran and dibutylamine. Carbofuran degrades to carbofuran-7-phenol. Photolysis may contribute to the environmental degradation of carbosulfan in water. Two regions of polar degradation products (66.7 % AR) were found but not characterized. The formation of these unidentified polar products in natural water bodies is assumed to be low, as long as furrow application is used. Carbosulfan is not readily biodegradable. Carbosulfan was low persistent in aerobic water/sediment systems. Main metabolites formed were carbofuran (max. 34.7 % AR in water; max. 20.1 % AR in sediment) and carbofuran-phenol (max. 23.2% AR in water; max. 6.22% AR in sediment). A non characterized metabolite (Unknown 3) appears at levels above 10 % AR in the sediment of some systems (max. 20.11 % AR after 7 d). This compound has been tentatively identified as a structure that contains the carbamate moiety and may be expected to produce carbofuran when degraded. It is unlikely that this compound can occur in surface water in significant level, as long as carbosulfan is used via furrow application. The amount of bound residues increased steadily up to 30.5 -43.0 % AR at the end of the experiments (102 d). No half lives are reported in carbosulfan DAR for metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol in the water/sediment systems. However for the resubmission, the residues of carbosulfan and the metabolites carbofuran and carbofuran-phenol were refitted and degradation endpoints were (re) calculated. Degradation endpoints from water/sediment studies summarized in the carbofuran DAR were also recalculated. Available water sediment studies under alkaline conditions (from carbofuran applicant Dianica) showed faster degradation of carbofuran and the formation of carbofuran-7-phenol at higher levels. For the resubmission, FOCUS PECSW/SED were calculated for all the relevant metabolites. The applicant presented an estimation of the potential for ground water contamination based on the FOCUS GW scheme. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by the parent carbosulfan or the metabolite dibutylamine above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. However it is noted that some parameters of the metabolite dibutylamine used in the simulations are uncertain. The main metabolite carbofuran was calculated to be present in leachate leaving the top 1m soil layer at 80th percentile annual average concentrations > 0.1 mu g/L in case of 8 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios with the range of 0.22-4.09 mu g/L using the PEARL model, and 7 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios with the range of 0.32-0.73 mu g/L using the PELMO model, when annual applications were simulated. Only the Porto (PEARL) or Porto and Thiva (PELMO) FOCUS scenarios resulted in a PECgw value < 0.1 mu g/L (0.023 mu g/L, 0.009 mu g/L and 0.004 mu g/L, respectively). When triennial applications were simulated by FOCUS PEARL, 7 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L parametric drinking water limit with the range of 0.24-1.11 mu g/L, and again Porto and Thiva FOCUS scenarios resulted in a PECgw value < 0.1 mu g/L (0.012 mu g/L and 0.069 mu g/L, respectively). When FOCUS PELMO was used for the simulation of triennial applications, 5 out of the 9 modelled FOCUS scenarios exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L parametric drinking water limit with the range of 0.15-0.30 mu g/L. The Kremsmanster, Porto, Sevilla and Thiva FOCUS scenarios resulted PECgw < 0.1 mu g/L (0.002 -0.099 mu g/L). The PECgw for the metabolites 3-keto-carbofuran and 3-hydroxy-carbofuran exceeded the 0.1 mu g/L parametric drinking water limit only in a few cases of FOCUS simulations when annual applications were simulated. When triennial applications were simulated, 3-keto-carbofuran exceeded this trigger only in one case (FOCUS PEARL, Piacenza scenario) of the simulations. However, it is noted that the simulations for the metabolites were regarded as worst case, as 100 % formation was assumed (which would be expected to be lower in reality). On the other hand it is also noted that another parameter (DT50 of the parent molecule) used in these simulations is regarded as favourable for all the metabolites. In summary, the potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by carbofuran, as a metabolite of the parent carbosulfan, above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be very high in geo-climatic situations that are represented by 8 out of the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Even at the drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L that is applied to groundwater, consumer exposure would be greater than 10% of the toxicological reference values for vulnerable consumer groups (toddlers and infants). Therefore a drinking water limit < 0.1 mu g/L is needed for the carbamate structured metabolites according to uniform principles. However, a method with a validated LOQ < 0.1 rho g/L for each analyte is not available. It is not expected that either carbosulfan or its transformation product carbofuran (from data in carbofuran dossier) may contaminate the air compartment or be prone to long range transport through air. The risk to birds and mammals from uptake of granules was assessed as acceptable provided that spills are avoided and the product is incorporated in soil. A high risk to birds and mammals was identified from residues in contaminated food items. The risk to birds and mammals needs to be further addressed. The risk to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for environmental conditions represented by the FOCUS scenarios D3, D4(stream), R1 and R3. A high risk was indicated for the scenario D4 (pond). Severe adverse effects were observed in laboratory studies with non-target arthropods. No statistical significant effects on non-target arthropods were observed in a field study indicating a low risk to non-target arthropods. No valid laboratory studies were available with earthworms. The risk assessment was based on a field study with broadcast application. In order to draw a final conclusion on the risk to earthworms it would be necessary to demonstrate that exposure in the field study is representative also for the in-furrow application of the granules. Alternatively a new field study where the representative use is simulated is needed. The risk to bees, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfop-P (haloxyfop-R),2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1348,"Haloxyfop-P is the ISO common name for the substance formerly referred to by the synonym 'haloxyfop-R' (introduced by DOW AgroSciences) which is in common use but without official status. This conclusion refers to the ISO common name haloxyfop-P. Haloxyfop-P is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024 Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on haloxyfop-P in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 21 November 2003. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 26 March 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 27 September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April and May 2005. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts following the procedure set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 451/2000 took place with representatives from the Member States on 9 June 2006 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 28 July 2006 (EFSA, 2006). Following the Commission Decision of 19 June 2007 (2007/437/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, Dow AgroSciences made a resubmission application for the inclusion of haloxyfop-P in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the European Commission review report as follows: The potential contamination of groundwater The risk to mammals The high toxicity to fish In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on haloxyfop-P in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 3 April 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 8 April 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 May 2009. At the same time, the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission decided to further consult the EFSA. By written request, received by the EFSA on 13 July 2009, the Commission requested the EFSA to arrange a peer review of the Additional Report provided by the rapporteur Member State, and to deliver its conclusion on the risk assessment within 90 days. The peer review commenced with EFSA's consideration of the Reporting Table containing the applicant's response to the comments and the rapporteur Member State's evaluation of the comments and response. All points that were identified as unresolved at the end of the comment evaluation phase were further considered in a series of scientific meetings via telephone conference with Member State experts in September 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2009. The EFSA conclusion has therefore been re-issued to update the risk assessment in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology. The original conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises broadcast spraying to control annual and perennial grasses in carrots, fodder legumes (peas and beans), rape seed, soy bean and sugar beet. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses as a herbicide. Full details of the GAP can be found in the end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'EF-1400' which was given the commercial name of 'Gallant' in the resubmission, an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), and registered under different trade names in Europe. For food of plant and animal origin, methods of analysis are available that will quantify haloxyfop and its esters, salts and conjugates, expressed as haloxyfop. However, it is not clear if the hydrolysis step is validated and therefore it is not known if it was comparable to the hydrolysis step in the metabolism studies. As a consequence of this the residue may be underestimated. Methods of analysis are available for soil, water and air which also include a hydrolysis step that is not necessary but which in this case will over estimate the residue. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method such as the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. The toxicological studies were generally performed with pure (> 98%) racemic haloxyfop or haloxyfop-P methyl ester or with neat substances. The toxicokinetic studies indicate that absorbed methyl ester will rapidly be hydrolysed to the parent acid and the S-form haloxyfop present in racemic haloxyfop will instantaneously undergo stereochemical inversion to haloxyfop-P. Therefore, the various compounds used for testing are assumed to elicit the same systemic effects following administration and these effects can be attributed to haloxyfop-P. The absorption is rapid (> 80%) and the excretion extensive. The acute oral toxicity is moderate i. e. LD50 is around 300 mg/kg bw and the dermal toxicity low LD50> 2000 mg/kg bw, proposed classification of Xn, R22 ""Harmful if swallowed"". No acute inhalation toxicity studies are available. Neither racemic haloxyfop nor haloxyfop-P methyl ester was irritating to skin and haloxyfop-P methyl ester was not a sensitizer. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is not irritating to the eye whereas racemic haloxyfop induced signs of irritation in the conjunctival sacs and iris and caused corneal opacity covering up to 100% of the cornea in all animals. Signs of irritation (corneal opacity) persisted for 21 days in un-rinsed eyes racemic haloxyfop is therefore irritating to the eye and the classification of Xi; R41 "" Risk of serious damage to eyes"" is proposed. The relevant short term NOAEL is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1year dog study which would also be said to cover the effects observed in the 90-day studies in the dog and monkey at 2 mg/kg bw/day. There is no mutagenic or genotoxic potential for haloxyfop-P. Haloxyfop is not carcinogenic in the rat but there are hepatocellular adenomas in the highest dose in the mice associated with peroxisome proliferation. No reproductive effects were observed at the highest dose level of 1 mg/kg bw/day, thus being a NOAEL for reproductive effects, the NOAEL for offspring toxicity is 0.065 mg/kg bw/day based on decreased body weight of f1a pups after 21 days at 1 mg/kg bw/day. The NOAEL for maternal effects is 1 mg/kg bw/day and 7.5 mg/kg bw/day (in rat and rabbit, respectively) and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 7.5 mg/kg bw/day in the rat study and 15 mg/kg bw/day in the rabbit study. The groundwater metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not of relevance based on hazard assessment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.00065 mg/kg bw/day, the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.005 mg/kg bw/day and the acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.075 mg/kg bw, with the safety factor of 100 applied. The operator exposure was estimated using the standard models UK-POEM and the German model. The dermal absorption is 7% and 12% for the concentrate and the diluted product, respectively. The AOEL is exceeded (169%) according to the UK-POEM even with PPE (coverall) but is below according to the German model if PPE (coverall and gloves) is applied (12%). The estimated worker and bystander exposure is below the AOEL. To investigate the residue behaviour of haloxyfop-P in plants and livestock either the haloxyfop Risomer or the unresolved isomeric mixture or ester variants of both compounds were used. Plant metabolism was studied following foliar application to crops representing leafy crops, root vegetables, pulses and oilseeds. Irrespective of the ester variant or whether the racemic mixture or only the R-isomer was applied, the metabolism in all the studied crops was found to be similar commencing by a rapid and almost complete degradation to haloxyfop (R, S) very soon after application, followed by conjugation with carbohydrates and triglycerides. These conjugates appeared to be unstable under alkaline and acidic conditions, releasing haloxyfop (R, S) again. Metabolism studies with goats and hens indicated that haloxyfop (R, S) is excreted unmetabolised by livestock animals. In tissue and organs residues were present as haloxyfop (R, S) in either form, free and conjugated. Due to the lack of isomeric specificity of the pre-registration analytical methods any possible stereochemical inversion in either direction in food of plant and animal origin could not be detected, even though it is assumed based on available data in soil and in rats that if such inversion occurs it will be most likely from the S-to the R-isomer. A sufficient number of residue trial data with haloxyfop-P methyl according to the GAP proposed for the representative uses is available to conclude the risk assessment for consumers and to propose MRLs. From crop rotation studies it can be concluded that no significant residue levels are expected in rotational and succeeding crops following application of haloxyfop-P methyl according to the critical GAP. The residue levels that could occur in food of animal origin when crops treated with haloxyfop-P methyl are fed to animals were assessed based on livestock feeding studies and MRLs have been proposed. The dietary risk assessment performed for different consumer groups indicates that there are no chronic and acute concerns related to dietary exposure resulting from the representative uses assessed within the peer review procedure. Soil degradation studies suggested a possible main degradation route for haloxyfop-P methyl ester under aerobic conditions. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly (DT50 < 0.6 d at 20 degrees C) in six soils to produce the acid metabolite haloxyfop-P-6 (DE-535 acid, max. 53-91% AR), which further degraded to DE-535 pyridino17 (max. 29-52% AR). Other two metabolites, DE-535 pyridinone(8) and DE-535 phenol(9), exceeded the trigger value of 10% AR on a limited number of occasions: DE-535 pyridinone reached a maximum of 11.0% AR after 120 days, and DE-535 phenol with maximum concentration of 12.6% AR after 14 days. Final degradation ended up in minor unidentified metabolites, non-extractable soil residues (max. 44% AR after 90 days) and carbon dioxide (max. 35% AR after 90 days). Haloxyfop-P can be considered as very low to low persistent, DE-535 pyridinol as medium to high persistent, and DE-535 phenol as moderate to high persistent. A data gap for reliable degradation rates in soil for DE-535 pyridinone was identified at the PRAPeR teleconference TC18. Sorption characteristics indicated that haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone are very high to high mobile in soil, whereas DE-535 phenol can be classified as low mobile. Haloxyfop-P and the metabolite trifluoroacetic acid exceeded the limit value of 0.1 mu g/L on individual occasions in some lysimeter studies, but the annual average concentrations were < 0.1 mu g/L for haloxyfop-P methyl ester and all its metabolites. Because the calculation model for PECsoil was not consistent with the method used for the degradation rates values, soil concentrations at later time points for haloxyfop-P, DE-535 phenol and DE-535 pyridinone should be recalculated. However, the new PECsoil values will not have an impact on the risk assessment for terrestrial organisms as safe uses have been shown using the reliable initial PECsoil. The hydrolysis rate of haloxyfop-P methyl ester was directly correlated with pH (stable at pH 4, DT50= 43 days at pH 7 and DT50= 0.63 days at pH 9). The photolysis of haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P was investigated in pH 5 sterile buffer and natural water (pH 8.5). A new metabolite, with a chemical structure similar to dibenzofuran, was identified up to 18.6% AR in the sterile buffer system. The aquatic exposure of DE-535 furan was appropriately addressed in the resubmission dossier. Two natural water-sediment systems under controlled laboratory conditions showed that haloxyfop-P methyl ester was rapidly hydrolyzed to haloxyfop-P, the concentrations of which were in the range of 63.8- 81.5% AR after 1-30 days. At the same time the concentration of the metabolite DE-535 pyridinol increased up to 19.7% AR after 59 days. The same two metabolites were also found in the sediment phase up to 33.7% AR (haloxyfop-P) and 16.4% AR (DE-535 pyridinol). Haloxyfop-P methyl ester degraded rapidly in both the water and sediment phases with first order DT50 values < 0.3 days. The calculated DT50 values for haloxyfop-P ranged from 39.2 - 51.7 d (whole system) and from 31.5-54.6 d (water phase). The available aquatic exposure assessment is appropriate for addressing the spray drift route on entry to surface water for haloxyfop-P methyl ester, haloxyfop-P and DE-535 pyridinol. Additional calculations were performed including a worst-case contamination contribution from run-off and drainage of 15% of the application rate. After the resubmission procedure, a new FOCUS groundwater modelling with agreed input parameters was still necessary to fully address the potential for groundwater exposure for haloxyfop-P and major soil metabolites DE-535 phenol, DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone. Based on provisional results presented in the DAR, not complying with the recommendations of FOCUS groundwater guidance regarding the use of first order degradation kinetics, a high potential for groundwater exposure for soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol (80th percentile annual average concentrations: 0.55-2.87 mu g/L) and DE-535 pyridinone (0.26-0.90 mu g/L) was identified. In the resubmission dossier the toxicological assessment was able to conclude that metabolites DE-535 pyridinol and DE-535 pyridinone were not relevant. However, in case the new FOCUS PECGw calculations will indicate that these metabolites will exceed the trigger of 0.75 mu g/L, a consumer risk assessment might be needed. Based on the available volatilisation experiment and the calculated atmospheric half-life, contamination of the air compartment and long range transport through air are not expected. The first tier risk assessment for herbivorous and insectivorous birds resulted in TER values above the Annex VI trigger indicating a low risk. For medium herbivorous and insectivorous mammals the acute risk is considered to be low, while a first tier high long-term risk was identified. The Member State experts in EPCO 22 did not accept a proposed refinement using a higher endpoint from a 16-week dietary study. It was agreed to use the endpoint of 1 mg/kg bw/day from a 2-generation reproduction study. Furthermore, since the half-life for residues in vegetation was observed to be longer than the default value, residue decline data for each crop should be used in the risk assessment. The resulting TER values were foreseen to be below the Annex VI trigger indicating a high risk, and the risk to mammals was not addressed in the original review. The long-term risk was addressed for herbivorous mammals in the Additional Report based on the reproductive endpoint and refinement of PD for the intended uses in sugar beet, field peas and beans. For the intended autumn use in oilseed rape refinements based on a developmental endpoint were not accepted as the intended used may coincide with the breeding season of herbivorous mammals, but it was agreed that a safe use could be shown in Northern Europe. A data gap was identified to address the risk to herbivorous mammals for the Southern Member States, at the European level. Consequently, a similar data gap was identified to address the long-term risk to insectivorous mammals from the use in oilseed rape in Southern Member States. Haloxyfop-P methyl ester is very toxic to aquatic organisms, fish being the most sensitive group of organisms. Risk mitigation comparable to 5 m buffer zones is required to meet the Annex VI trigger. The risk for aquatic organisms from the surface water metabolites haloxyfop-P, DE-535 pyridinol, and DE-535 furan was assessed as low. Two metabolites were found in concentrations >0.1 mu g/L in the FOCUS ground water modelling. DE-535 pyridinol is considered to be of no ecotoxicological relevance. An assessment of new data on DE-535 pyridinone indicated a lower toxicity to aquatic organisms than the parent and the risk was assessed as low in the Additional Report (March 2009). The risk to bees and other non-target arthropods is low. The risk to earthworms, other soil macro organisms and soil micro-organisms from haloxyfop-P methyl ester and haloxyfop-P is considered to be low. The risk to soil organisms from exposure to the persistent soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol was not addressed in the original review. Assessment of the soil metabolites DE-535 pyridinol, DE-pyridinone and DE-535 phenol in the Additional Report (March 2009) indicated a low risk to earthworms, non-target soil macro-organisms and micro-organisms. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low. The risk to non-target plants was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance picloram<SUP>1</SUP> European Food Safety Authority,2009,EFSA JOURNAL,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1390,"Picloram is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023 Picloram was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as ` the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report.. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on picloram in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 7 May 2007. The peer review was initiated on 24 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October -November 2009. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide, as proposed by the notifier, which comprise foliar spraying in oilseed rape for the control of broadleaved weeds. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'GALERA (GF-224)', a soluble concentrate (SL), containing 67 g/L picloram and 267 g/L clopyralid, registered under different trade names in Europe. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are methods available to monitor picloram residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin and environmental matrices, however, the experts at the PRAPeR 66 meeting (April 2009) could not agree on the acceptability of some methods. Following the finalisation of the residue definition for plant matrices a data gap concerning the monitoring analytical method will have to be set. With regard to mammalian toxicology, picloram was rapidly and extensively absorbed but did not show any potential of bioaccumulation. With a low acute toxicity after ingestion or by inhalation, a sensitisation study with limitations supported by positive results with salts and esters led the PRAPeR 69 meeting of experts to propose a classification with R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". In repeated-dose toxicity studies, the primary target organ was the liver, but effects in the kidneys and blood were also observed in some studies. The relevant oral short-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAEL) were 300 mg/kg bw/day in rats and 35 mg/kg bw/day in dogs. No potential for genotoxicity was demonstrated in a battery of studies in vitro and in vivo. In long-term studies with rats and mice picloram did not show any carcinogenic potential; the relevant NOAELs were 60 mg/kg bw/day in rats and 1000 mg/kg bw/day in mice. In a two-generation rat study, no evidence of reproductive or offspring toxicity was observed up to 1000 mg/kg bw/day, whereas some parental toxicity was noted at this dose level. In the developmental rat studies, performed with two salts of picloram, cranio-facial malformations were observed in single foetuses in a mid-dose and high-dose group, but were concluded to be unrelated to treatment. In the developmental rabbit studies, the incidences of a few foetal abnormalities were higher at the top dose level in each study, in the presence of maternal toxicity, and were considered to be substance-related. The relevant maternal NOAELs were 30 mg/kg bw/day for rabbits and 280 mg/kg bw/day for rats, whereas the relevant developmental NOAELs were 560 mg/kg bw/day for rats and 300 mg/kg bw/day for rabbits. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.3 mg/kg bw/day, and the agreed Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.3 mg/kg bw. These values are based on the rabbit developmental study supported by the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. Based on an in vivo study with the representative formulation 'GALERA (GF-224)', the dermal absorption values are 0.1% for the dilution and 10% for the concentrate. The operator, worker and bystander exposure estimates are all providing exposure values below the AOEL (without the use of personal protective equipment for the operators and workers). The metabolism and distribution of picloram was investigated in oilseed rape and wheat. Both studies demonstrate that picloram is not degraded but quickly forms conjugates in plant material. Hence, the residue definition for risk assessment was agreed as picloram, free and conjugated expressed as picloram. For monitoring, it is currently unclear whether the analytical method does fully or partially analyse any conjugated picloram, and whether conjugated picloram will have to be considered in the residue definition for monitoring and MRL setting. Seven GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) conforming residue trials were performed on oilseed rape. It has however still to be demonstrated that the analytical method used in the supervised residue trials fully released the picloram conjugates. In a confined crop rotation study metabolism in succeeding crops was found to be similar to that seen in primary crops. In the tested rotational cereal, oilseed and root crops the vast majority of radioactivity was present as picloram or conjugates of picloram. Residues above the limit of quantification (LOQ) may be expected in rotational crops. On the basis of the confined study default levels were derived for several rotational crops to conduct a risk assessment and to propose maximum residue limits (MRLs). Nevertheless, rotational field crop studies should be submitted to confirm the proposed MRLs, or to modify the proposed MRLs if necessary. The metabolism and distribution of picloram was investigated in lactating ruminants and poultry. Picloram was not metabolised to any significant degree in goats and poultry. However, further clarification is required on the composition of the non-polar fractions in the goat study. Based on the metabolism data submitted, residues in animal products should be defined as picloram for both risk assessment and monitoring purposes. A re-assessment of residues in food of animal origin after the experts' meeting (Addendum 6, July 2009, not peer reviewed) indicated that residues in products of animal origin are unlikely to be significant. In a revised dietary risk assessment it could be demonstrated that the chronic and acute dietary intake is expected to be well below the toxicological reference values ADI (< 1%) and ARfD (< 5%). In soil under aerobic conditions, picloram exhibits low to high persistence forming no major (> 10% active radioactivity (AR)) metabolites. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 10.224.4 % AR after 119 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a significant sink, accounting for 7.2-27.7% AR after 119 days. The degradation of picloram was considered as dose-dependent (the higher the application rate -the slower the degradation). No valid soil photolysis study was available in the dossiers, however, it cannot be excluded that photolysis is a relevant route of degradation of picloram, therefore a data gap was identified for a valid soil photolysis study. Picloram exhibits very high to high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption was pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems picloram degraded exhibiting high persistence. Two major degradates were formed; the 3,6-dichloro analogue of picloram, which is known as aminopyralid, and the 5,6-dichloro analogue of picloram. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a negligible sink in the material balance accounting for = 0.1% AR. Residues not extracted from sediment were a sink, representing 5.1-11.9 % AR at the study end (102 days). The necessary surface water-and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for picloram and for the degradates, at steps 1-2 levels. It should be noted that some end points regarding the degradates, which were used for the calculations as input parameters, were taken from the DAR of aminopyralid. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses (single spring triennial application to spring or winter oilseed rape, at maximum application rate of 23.45 g/ha) by picloram above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be high in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios for oilseed rape. Picloram was calculated to be present in the leachates leaving the top 1m soil layer at 80th percentile annual average concentrations > 0.1 mu g/L in case of 5 out of the 6 modelled FOCUS scenarios, with the range of 0.241-0.338 mu g/L (PELMO) or 0.228-0.345 mu g/L (PEARL) for winter oilseed rape; and 2 out of the 3 modelled FOCUS scenarios with the range of 0.312-0.321 mu g/L (PELMO) or 0.275-0.352 mu g/L (PEARL) for spring oilseed rape. Only the Porto FOCUS scenario resulted in PECgw < 0.1 mu g/L (0.076 mu g/L or 0.079 mu g/L for winter oil seed rape, and 0.056 mu g/L or 0.066 mu g/L for spring oil seed rape, depending on the used FOCUS model). The available lysimeter study indicated that contamination of groundwater by picloram is unlikely from the applied for intended uses assessed in this conclusion. Picloram is not expected to be prone to long-range transport through the air compartment. The risk to all non-target species (i.e. birds, mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro-and micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatment) was expected to be low. According to the response provided by the rapporteur Member State after the PRAPeR experts' meeting, the final end point recommended for risk assessment for mammals was the NOAEL of 300 mg a. s./kg bw/day. The experts agreed that dicotyledonous aquatic species tested at a higher dose as well as rooted plants may be more representative than Lemna, due to the mechanism of action (i.e. systemic herbicide effective against dicotyledonous species) and the environmental fate and behaviour (i.e. 44% accumulation in sediment) of picloram. Nevertheless, a data gap was not considered necessary for the EU evaluation, however it was underlined to address the issue at Member State level.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance sulfuryl fluoride European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1441,"Sulfuryl fluoride is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 6(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC3, the United Kingdom received an application from Dow AgroSciences for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/305/EC4. Following the agreement between the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as ' the Commission') and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), the United Kingdom, made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on sulfuryl fluoride, hereafter referred to as the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), available on 29 October 2004. The peer review was initiated on 9 November 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the RMS and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 28 September 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007, leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, comprising application as a fumigant in food storage to control all life stages of arthropods (e.g. meal moth, flour and grain beetles) in emptied flour mills and empty grain storage facilities at maximum concentrations of 128 g/m(3) (CTP = 1500 (Concentration X Time Product)). Details of the applications and timings can be found in the list of end points. The uses submitted in the DAR on dried fruit and tree nut commodities were withdrawn by the applicant for the EU evaluation. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'ProFume', a gas (GA), registered under different trade names in Europe. The formulation contains 99.4% w/w sulfuryl fluoride pure (the technical active substance is the product). Analytical methodology is available for the determination of the active substance and the impurities in the technical material as manufactured and for the active substance in the formulation, which is in practice the technical material. Several methods are available to monitor the compounds given in the respective residue definitions for food of plant origin, in blood and urine, however additional data may be required after the finalization of the residue definitions in the different matrices. A data gap was identified for a method for residues in air. With regard to mammalian toxicity, sulfuryl fluoride has been classified (29th ATP, Commission Directive 2005/73/EC5) as T; R23 'Toxic by inhalation' based on reported deaths in humans. In addition, the experts' meeting proposed classification as T; R25 'Toxic if 'wallowed' and Xi; R37 'Irritating to the respiratory system'. It was also classified as Harmful; R48/20 'Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure/ inhalation route'. The relevant short-term exposure No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 30 ppm in mice and rabbits, 20 ppm in dogs and 100 ppm in rats based on slight renal hyperplasia and mineralisation at 300 ppm. In rats and mice the longterm NOAEL is 20 ppm. Sulfuryl fluoride does not show any genotoxic or carcinogenic potential. It is not a reproductive or developmental toxicant. In multigeneration studies the parental NOAEL was 5 ppm while the NOAEL in offspring was 20 ppm based on reduced growth during lactation at 150 ppm. The lowest relevant developmental NOAEL is 75 ppm, from the rabbit study. The NOAEL for the acute study in rats is 300 ppm. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the long term toxicity study in rats, with a safety factor of 100. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.7 mg/kg bw and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Concentration (AOEC) resulted in 1 ppm. For the bystander exposure assessment, an AOEC of 3 ppm was set. The RMS proposed that operators introducing fumigant or carrying out tasks associated with the aeration procedure should wear suitable respiratory protective equipment. Based on the available data, a 10 metre exclusion zone around the fumigated structure was considered to protect unprotected persons (i.e. bystanders) from levels of sulfuryl fluoride above 3 ppm. Metabolism studies that address the nature of the residues on food commodities upon fumigation with sulfuryl fluoride were not submitted. Therefore it was discussed by experts whether the metabolism or mode of degradation, respectively, of sulfuryl fluoride in food and feed commodities was sufficiently addressed and whether there was satisfactory proof from the information and papers submitted, that the proposed breakdown mechanism is identical in all matrices as suggested by the applicant. The experts concluded that the available information is not sufficient to assess the involved reactions, to verify the reported results and to confirm that sulfuryl fluoride and free fluoride ion will be the only relevant residues the consumer may be exposed to. Therefore the consumer risk assessment, mainly with regard to the nature of the residue, cannot be finalised. Even though uses on the fumigation of food items (dried fruits, nuts) were withdrawn during the peer review procedure and only uses for structural treatments remain, there is still the potential for consumer exposure to inorganic fluoride through contaminated products, such as flour and bran that remained in the mill machinery during fumigation, or grain stored in silos in the mill. Available data show that high fluoride residue levels in flour and bran occurred after the production in a treated mill structure had been taken up again. Therefore measures to avoid contaminated cereal products getting into the food chain are necessary if, in practice, contamination cannot be avoided. The RMS suggested separate MRLs for fluoride ion should be proposed based on background levels. However, there are currently no agreed acceptable fluoride background levels in food products in the EU and therefore the allocation of an adequate MRL for fluoride might be difficult. Any higher MRL than at natural background levels would trigger a consumer exposure and risk assessment. It is noted that such assessment will also need to consider other sources of fluoride exposure. Sulfuryl fluoride is a gas under all environmental conditions (boiling point -54 degrees C). The vapour pressure is deemed to be high according to the available data. Potential degradation routes for sulfuryl fluoride were analysed in the DAR. All routes were considered negligible except the chemical hydrolysis that may occur in ocean waters. The initial assessment of the fate and behaviour of sulfuryl fluoride in the environment was based on a limited set of experimental data (essentially limited to the physical and chemical properties of the substance) and a number of assumptions and indirect information (such as production figures and atmospheric half-life) that were used as input parameters in the fugacity models employed for the assessment of the fate and behaviour of the substance at global scale. Assessment of the fate and behaviour of sulfuryl fluoride at the field scale level was not presented by the applicant in the initial submission. Also the fate and behaviour of hydrolysis transformation products was not addressed. A number of data gaps were identified in the early stages of the peer review to properly document the information used in the assessment. One of the key parameters used in the assessment is the atmospheric lifetime. The value used by the applicant was derived from a presumed monitored tropospheric concentration only available by a personal communication of one of the scientists involved. The experts' meeting considered that the data provided were not sufficiently documented for regulatory purposes and identified a data gap for the determination of atmospheric lifetime. At the experts' meetings (PRAPeR 02 and 03) on environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology, respectively, the RMS was asked to undertake further assessments: in particular on wet deposition and the potential for contamination of soil and water by metabolites of sulfuryl fluoride; to evaluate field-scale PEC values in soil and surface water close to treated installations and revised fugacity modelling to calculate global-scale PECs in soil, water and air. Additional estimates were also requested for global warming potential (GWP), based on worst case atmospheric lifetime and anticipated sales volumes. These points have been largely addressed by the RMS in addendum 3 of May 2007 based on the information provided by the applicant. However, the assessment provided by the applicant and presented by the RMS in the addendum did not strictly follow the scenario approach proposed by the experts' meeting ( only lifetime of 4.5 yr was used and production figures were generally limited to historical records from 1992-2000) and did not take into consideration most recent information available at the time on the occurrence of sulfuryl fluoride in the atmosphere. This information is crucial since it supersedes the information used by the applicant to estimate the atmospheric lifetime of the substance on which most of the fate and behaviour assessment of sulfiryl fluoride is based. As a consequence, EFSA had redone parts of the modelling presented by the applicant and the RMS in addendum 3 of May 2007. The most relevant results are presented in the EFSA conclusion, and the background input parameters and calculations are documented in the EFSA addendum of July 2007. With respect to the field scale assessment, EFSA did a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in the field scale soil assessment (based on LEVEL I fugacity model) and added some considerations to address the transformation products of sulfuryl fluoride at field scale. Neither the RMS addendum 3 nor the EFSA addendum has been peer reviewed. A number of data gaps were identified during the peer review. The main areas of concern from the fate and behaviour point of view are the high uncertainty associated with the atmospheric lifetime (best available estimate was about 15 yr) and the intrinsic global warming potential that needed to be re-calculated. At the time of finalising this conclusion values previously estimated based on measurements of the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network have been refined and a longer atmospheric lifetime than previously reported is recently quoted in the scientific literature (36 +/- 11 yr). Based on these recent data, a GWP of 4780 for the 100 years horizon has been published. Sulfuryl fluoride is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However, due to the specific use and the physicalchemical properties of the substance, exposure of non-target organisms is considered negligible and hence the risk to non-target organisms is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Lecaniciium muscarium strain Ve6 notified as Verticillium lecanii European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1446,"Lecanicillium muscarium, notified as Verticillium lecanii, is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 May 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as, jhe Regulation'). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as,, the Commission') in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. The Netherlands being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, which was received by the EFSA on 5 July 2007. The peer review was initiated on 7 May 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation to the sole notifier Koppert Beheer B.V., and on 21 January 2009 to the Member States. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a scientific meeting with Member State experts in June 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in November 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses on cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, strawberry and ornamentals for the control of whitefly and thrips. The formulation is applied as a spray to the crops. Full details of the application rate and timings can be found in the list of end points attached at appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Mycotal"", a wettable powder formulation (WP). The available data indicate that the micro-organism is not competitive in the environment unless the host species are present, it is not pathogenic to humans, nor toxic or infective and does not produce any known toxicologically significant secondary metabolites, therefore methods of analysis for monitoring are not required. However, it should be noted that some methods are given in the DAR although there are no validation data. Sufficient test methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available. Methods for the unequivocal identification of the strain could not be concluded on, as the new information has not been peer-reviewed. The acceptability of the methods for microbial contaminants was questioned as they appeared not to be ISO methods. After the experts"" meeting the notifier confirmed that ISO methods were used. Further validation is needed for the whitefly assay. It was considered that the level of contaminating pathogens was in some cases too high when compared to internationally available proposed levels for pathogenic microbial contaminants, and this is considered by EFSA as a critical area of concern. In acute toxicity studies, Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 did not induce signs of toxicity, pathogenicity or infectivity. The human/rat body temperature would mean that the micro-organism would not remain viable in these warm-blooded species. Clinical cases of systemic infection were described in the open literature in immuno-compromised patients, either receiving chemo/radiotherapy, or treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics; very rare cases of keratitis were caused by Lecanicillium species. No potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson & Kligman test. Sensitisation studies with micro-organisms are considered to be of limited value, as reactions to foreign proteins (most micro-organisms) can be anticipated. Therefore, all micro-organisms should be regarded as potential sensitisers ( in contact with skin and by inhalation). The following phrase was agreed by the experts ""Micro-organisms may have the potential to provoke sensitising reactions"", since labelling with risk phrases applicable to chemicals ( according to Directive 67/548/EEC4 and Directive 1999/45/EC5) is not appropriate for micro-organisms. In a 28-day study by inhalation in rats conducted with the representative formulation, MVycotal"", the no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) was found at 1 mg/m(3), based on macro- and microscopic changes in the lungs, nasal cavity and mediastinal lymph nodes most pronounced at 10 and 100 mg/m3 groups. Although these changes were indicative of a local immune reaction rather than a toxicological effect, this could not be confirmed due to the lack of a control group in the study. Short-term toxicity is not expected, because accumulation of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 has not been demonstrated in the body. No potential for genotoxicity was found in vitro. As no known toxicologically significant metabolite was identified, the PRAPeR M3 meeting of experts agreed that no further data would be required for the genotoxicity end point. No reference values were set and none were needed as the micro-organism is not pathogenic or infective and does not produce toxins. Low risk was anticipated for operators if adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respiratory protective equipment (RPE) are worn. Workers are also required to use PPE to lower dermal exposure. No bystanders should be allowed during greenhouse applications. A concern was raised by the experts over outdoor bystander exposure by inhalation due to the potential sensitisation by inhalation and no protection possible for bystanders. The rapporteur Member State provided a risk characterisation for bystanders after the experts"" meeting, concluding that bystander exposure is low when compared to the amount of micro-organisms that are inhaled daily as a background value. Nevertheless, a concern over outdoor bystander inhalation remains. Furthermore, for outdoor uses, as there is an outstanding issue with the specification of the product with regard to some pathogenic contaminants, the exposure risk assessment of bystanders could not be finalized. Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not colonise the plant surface, and thus, the micro-organism is considered not likely to grow and multiply on plant material. Dietary exposure from use of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 is likely to be minimal. Moreover, any potentially occurring residual deposits on the treated crops are not relevant, as no human health concerns have been identified due to the toxicological profile of this strain. This assessment is subject to a final specification for microbial contamination of the plant protection product. The available data on the fate and behaviour in the environment indicated that the only component that required environmental exposure and risk assessment was the colony forming units of Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6. Data on the competitiveness and persistence of added Lecanicillium muscarium to soil and natural surface water indicated that the organism was not very competitive, and that following addition of Lecanicillium muscarium to the soil environment or common artificial plant substrate, or spray drift exposure to surface water, levels would be expected to decline. However, information on the natural background concentrations in soil was not presented and no specific data on the influence of UV light on persistence and multiplication in water were available. There was sufficient evidence to show that Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 does not produce any known secondary metabolites of toxicological or environmental concern. A general consideration to address the risk to non-target organisms was the very narrow 'natural' host or target range of Lecanicillium muscarium, in addition to the apparent lack of evidence that birds, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms and terrestrial plants are among the 'natural' target or host range of Lecanicillium muscarium. Furthermore, it was considered that the occurrence of 'natural' epizootics in the field could impose the same 'risks' to non-target organisms as epizootics induced by products with Lecanicillium muscarium. No acute toxic, infective or pathogenic effects were identified in any of the studies on birds, aquatic organisms, bees or earthworms based on the data available. However, data gaps were identified during the peer review to address the potential infectivity in fish and the potential toxicity to aquatic invertebrates, both being relevant for outdoor uses only. Many studies indicated no or only minimal effects on different non-target arthropod species exposed to Lecanicillium muscarium. There were however concerns among Member State experts about the strains and formulations used in the studies, and also concerns about the test conditions. Some effects were in fact seen on the species Encarsia formosa. A data gap was identified to further address the risk to non-target arthropods.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance oxadiazon,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1389,"Oxadiazon is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023. Oxadiazon was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 2 July 2008 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as 'the Commission') in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report has been established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on oxadiazon in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 11 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole notifier Bayer CropScience. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA identifying the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in April - May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2009. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide as proposed by the notifier, which comprises pre-emergence spraying in sunflower for the control of weeds. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'RONSTAR', an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 250 g/L oxadiazon. The minimum purity and specification of the active substance could not be concluded on. Data gaps for vapor pressure, flash point and surface tension were identified. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Oxadiazon residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin can be monitored by the multi-residue method DFG S19. Adequate methods are available to monitor oxadiazon residues in environmental matrices. A critical area of concern was highlighted based on the lack of information whether the tested material used in the toxicological studies is representative of the product manufactured and commercialised at present. In the mammalian metabolism studies, oxadiazon was moderately rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. No potential for accumulation was observed, the majority of the substance being excreted within 48 hours. The acute toxicity was low, either by the oral, dermal or inhalation route; no eye or skin irritation was observed, and no potential for skin sensitisation was found in a Magnusson and Kligman test. The main target organs of oxadiazon were the liver and the haematopoietic system consistent with oxadiazon's ability to inhibit protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of both haem and chlorophyll. The overall short term no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 18 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day study in rat. Oxadiazon itself did not present genotoxic potential, however a positive Ames test suggested the presence of a mutagenic impurity in the batch tested. The notifier should address the apparent presence of a mutagenic impurity in the technical specification (data gap). Liver tumours were observed in both the rat and mouse species; mechanistic studies confirmed that oxadiazon is a peroxisome proliferator. Although peroxisome proliferators are hepatocarcinogens in rodents, the current scientific opinion is that humans are not responsive to this class of non-genotoxic carcinogens and therefore, oxadiazon is unlikely to present a carcinogenic risk to humans. The relevant long term NOAEL was the dose level of 0.36 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study. Effects on the reproduction (increase in gestation length and irregular oestrus cycle) were more prominent in a preliminary dose-range finding study to the multigeneration study where total litter losses were observed at ca.30 mg/kg bw/day, as the main study was conducted with much lower dose levels. On this basis a classification with the risk phrase R62 ""possible risk of impaired fertility"" was proposed. The NOAEL in the main study was 5 mg/kg bw/day for reproduction toxicity while the NOAEL for parental and offspring's toxicity was 15 mg/kg bw/day. In the developmental toxicity studies, the rat presented the more critical (developmental) NOAEL for the risk assessment of 12 mg/kg bw/day. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of oxadiazon is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day based on the long-term rat study and applying a safety factor of 100. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.05 mg/kg bw/day based on the multigeneration study in rat and applying a safety factor of 100; no correction factor for enteral resorption is needed. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is set at 0.12 mg/kg bw, based on the developmental NOAEL of 12 mg/kg bw/day from the rat developmental toxicity study and a safety factor of 100. Dermal absorption was determined for the representative formulation, Ronstar (R) as 2 % for the concentrate and 3% for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed with human skin. The level of operator exposure for the representative formulation at a maximum dose rate of 750 g oxadiazon/ha in sunflowers was below the AOEL according to the German model without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and according to the UK POEM when the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application was considered. Re-entry worker exposure represented 68 % of the AOEL when no specific PPE is worn and bystander exposure to oxadiazon was considered negligible. Metabolism of oxadiazon was investigated in sunflowers, rice and tomatoes and in rotational crops (spinach, radish and barley). Metabolism was found to be moderate. Besides oxadiazon, its metabolites AE0618785, AE0608021, AE0616182 and AE0618784 were identified. Additionally metabolite AE608033 is possibly present in sunflowers and rotational crops. As AE0608033 is not covered by the rat metabolism nor addressed by other toxicology data on metabolites a data gap was formulated. The notifier should clarify the occurrence of metabolite AE0608033 in primary crops and rotational crops. As parent oxadiazon was the prevalent residue found in metabolism studies on primary and rotational crops, the plant residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed as oxadiazon alone. A sufficient number of residue trials on sunflowers supporting the notified GAPs have been submitted to propose an MRL. Based on the residue levels found in the metabolism on rotational crops it was concluded that field trials on rotational crops (root crops and cereals) are necessary. A provisional MRL for root and tuber crops was proposed on the basis of the results of the metabolism study on rotational crops. No metabolism studies on livestock are available. Provisional dietary burden calculations show an exceedance of the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg feed (DM) for beef cattle and pigs. Based on this provisional calculation a metabolism study on ruminants is necessary. Chronic and acute dietary intake calculations showed that an exceedance of ADI or ARfD is not expected for intake of crops after treatment of sunflowers with oxadiazon according to the notified GAPs. The finalisation of the risk assessment is pending the submission of field trials on rotational crops to confirm the estimated residue levels in root and tuber crops. Oxadiazon exhibits a high to very high persistence in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C (DT50 = 187-1238 d). A number of minor or very minor metabolites were found. Mineralization was low (CO2: max. 6.41 % after 300 d). Unextractable radioactivity reached levels of 5.44 - 35.5 % AR at the later data points (269 - 365 d). Under dark anaerobic conditions in soil at 20 degrees C oxadiazon also exhibits a very high persistence (DT50 = 841 d), metabolite AE 0608022 (max. 4.6 % AR after 120 d) is still increasing at the end of the study. Therefore, this metabolite would need to be further addressed with respect to potential ground water contamination in situations for which prolonged anaerobic conditions may be expected to occur. In the photolysis experiments in soil, the extent of degradation was low and no major metabolites were identified. The dissipation of oxadiazon under field conditions has been investigated in four sites in EU and two sites in USA. In the field trials performed in Germany oxadiazon exhibits a high persistence in soil (DT50 = 262 - 330 d). In the field trials performed in the Southern EU (Spain and S- France) oxadiazon exhibited a medium persistence in soil (DT50 = 90 - 95 d). The geometric mean of the normalized (20 degrees C, pF 2) field half lives (DT50 (norm. field geomean) = 120 d) was agreed to represent degradation of oxadiazon in soil for modelling purposes. The study performed in USA was considered supplementary information. The peer review identified a data gap for representative field soil accumulation studies. Potential for accumulation was addressed by PEC soil calculations based on the worst case field non normalized half life. Two soil batch adsorption desorption studies were performed with oxadiazon. According these studies, oxadiazon is expected to exhibit low mobility in soil (K-Foc = 979 - 1527 mL /g). Oxadiazon was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 5 and pH 7. At pH 9 oxadiazon hydrolysed (DT (50) = 11.7 d) yielding two major hydrolysis metabolites: AE 0608022 and AE 0592465. Aqueous photolysis of oxadiazon was fast under the irradiated experimental conditions. Half life in the surface water was calculated for different latitudes (30 degrees N - 50 degrees N) and seasons. Three major aqueous photolysis metabolites were identified: AE 0608035 (max. 15 % AR), AE 0608033 (max. 12.2 % AR) and AE 1117150 (max. 10.6 % AR). Oxadiazon is not readily biodegradable according to the available study. Dissipation / degradation was investigated in two dark water /sediment systems at 20 degrees C. Oxadiazon partitions with the sediment and degrades slowly in both systems (DT50 whole system. = 126.4 - 126.6 d). During the peer review, new FOCUS Step 3 and Step 4 PEC SW /SED calculations were provided by the notifier. The meeting of experts identified some drawbacks in these calculations. In addendum 2, RMS provided new PECSW/SED calculations in accordance with the meeting discussions. An estimation of the potential for oxadiazon to accumulate in the sediment was provided in addendum 1. An accumulation factor of 1.96 was derived from the 10 years plateau identified in this calculation. A generic FOCUS Step 1 and Step 2 PECSW/SED calculation is available for the photolysis metabolite AE0608022. Potential contamination of ground water by oxadiazon was assessed with FOCUS GW PEARL and PELMO models. In both cases, annual average concentration of oxadiazon in the leachate was below the regulatory limit of 0.1 mu g / L for the 80th percentile concentration at 1 m depth over 20 yr of continuous application in sunflowers. Oxadiazon may be considered medium to low volatile. A photochemical half life in the atmosphere of 0.22 d has been calculated with Atkinson's method. Oxadiazon is not expected to contaminate remote areas through long range transport. The Tier I assessment provided TER values above the Annex VI trigger for the acute and short-term risk to medium herbivorous and insectivorous birds. The long-term TER value was above the Annex VI trigger for herbivorous birds, whereas the TER value for insectivorous birds (based on a diet of small insects) failed to meet the trigger. Member State experts considered that insectivorous birds to a certain (sufficient) degree would base their diet on large insects with lower residue levels and therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was considered as low. The acute and long-term risk to mammals was assessed as low, as was the risk to birds and mammals from eating fish and consumption of contaminated drinking water. Data gaps were identified for the notifier to address the risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals. Oxadiazon was considered to be very toxic to aquatic organisms, with algae and fish reproduction as the most sensitive endpoints. The acute risk to fish, invertebrates and higher plants was addressed at FOCUSsw Step 3 without risk mitigation. Only one out of four relevant FOCUSsw scenarios passed the Annex VI trigger for the risk assessment of algae, based on a higher tier algae biomass endpoint and 20m buffer zones to mitigate spray drift and run-off. In order to address the long-term risk to fish further refinements are needed (i.e. data gap), since exposure mitigation was insufficient to address the risk and refinement of the chronic fish toxicity endpoint was not accepted by Member State experts (i.e. adding sediment to the test system). Refinements in line with the recommendation in the PPR-panel opinion on Dimoxystrobin were suggested. The in-field risk assessment to non-target arthropods indicated a high risk to T. pyri, whereas the off-field risk could be considered as low. Laboratory and extended laboratory studies with three species of soil living non-target arthropods indicated that the risk from the intended spraying of bare soil could be considered as low. The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance quinmerac European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1523,"Quinmerac is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 1095/2007(4) In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of quinmerac in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the noninclusion of quinmerac in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant BASF SE made a resubmission application for the inclusion of quinmerac in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 18 June 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 22 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 5 August 2009. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on quinmerac. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of quinmerac as a herbicide on oilseed rape, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. There was a data gap identified in the section physical and chemical properties of the active substance. No critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. In the residues area, for the specific use on oilseed rape, plant metabolism has been reasonably addressed. An outstanding issue in plant metabolism is clarification on the potential for opening of the quinoline ring structure. In rotational crops, significant residues may occur at shorter plant back intervals, and further data are required to address residue levels in these crops. This may have implications for the risk assessment but it is not a critical area of concern. The fate and behaviour of quinmerac and its metabolites in the environment has been adequately investigated and end points have been derived, allowing the risk assessment to be completed at EU level. The risk to birds and mammals from the representative formulation was not addressed. Furthermore, a critical area of concern was identified by EFSA regarding the long-term risk to earthworms from the soil metabolite BH 518-5, based on the indications of a high risk from existing data. For all other nontarget organisms the risk from the representative use was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenugreek seed powder (FEN 560),2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1448,"Fenugreek seed powder (FEN 560) is a new active substance for which, in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC, 3 France received an application from Societe Occitane de Fabrications et de Technologies (SOFT) for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2004/131/EC4 Following the agreement between the European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State France made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on fenugreek seed powder, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 6 January 2005. The peer review was initiated on 15 March 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in November 2005. The identified issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2006, November 2006, December 2006 and May 2009. A final consultation on the outcome of the experts' discussions took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October-November 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant activator on grapevines. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Stimulia', the applicant proposed that the formulation is a soluble powder (SP). The formulation was questioned during the peer review process and the formulation type remains unclear. Methods of analysis for monitoring are not required due to the nature of this product. The majority of the physical-chemical properties data were considered to be not relevant for this product. It was. agreed that this product should be specified as fenugreek seed powder 100 %. Marker components were selected for quality control purposes but concentration ranges for these components were not agreed. Also a specification limit for mycotoxins has not been agreed. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that some quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some storage stability data outstanding although it is noted that these are available in the 2009 addendum to Volume 3 B. 2 but are not peer reviewed. A sprayability study for the formulation is needed as the product failed the wet sieve test. The infra-red spectrum for fenugreek seed powder is also a data requirement. With regard to the mammalian toxicity assessment, most of the information was from the published literature. Tests performed in 2006 demonstrated the absence of skin or eye irritating properties, and no mutagenic effect was observed in an Ames test. The powder is of low acute oral toxicity in mice and rats. Published short-term rat studies of limited validity showed a no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 2500 mg/kg bw/day. The available information did not address the concern regarding potential reproductive toxicity and hormonal activity. Therefore a reliable NOAEL for these effects could not be established and reference values could not be set. Consequently, the risk assessment for the operators, bystanders and workers cannot be concluded. Limited experimental data are available on the fate of fenugreek seed powder when applied to grapevine. Fenugreek seed powder is not considered to act systemically in plants. It contains natural substances and it seems reasonable to assume that these substances are degraded according to the known metabolic pathways for plant matter. Therefore it was concluded that the pertinent residue on treated crops to be considered in a consumer risk assessment is fenugreek seed powder. It was agreed not to propose a residue definition for monitoring and MRL's for residues of fenugreek seed powder in grapevine. The notified use on grapevine did not require the assessment of residues in following crops and in livestock. No data on the amounts of fenugreek seed powder present on the crop at the time of harvest were submitted. Hence, estimates were made on the basis of the application rate, crop density and surface area assuming no wash-off or degradation occurred until harvest. On this basis, approximate values for consumer intake of fenugreek seed powder from treated grapes and leaves were estimated. Since no toxicological reference values could be established for fenugreek seed powder, a comparison of estimated and acceptable daily intake for the consumer has not been not possible. There are also no data available to compare the estimated consumer intake following a pesticidal use of fenugreek seed powder to the amounts of fenugreek seed spice usually consumed in the human diet. The only parameters available for comparison are doses administered in medical practice, or as a dietary supplement; however these applications are always intended to serve a particular purpose, and such products usually carry a warning label. Though it was agreed that the consumer intake of fenugreek seed powder in terms of the use in grapevine is overestimated by the theoretical calculations, however it could not be agreed by all experts that a comparison to similar doses of fenugreek seed administered as medical products or dietary supplements was appropriate. No experimental data on the fate and behaviour of fenugreek seed powder were submitted. The risk assessment was performed on basis of estimated worst case initial exposure and on basis of the following case elements presented by the applicant: The fenugreek seed powder contains natural substances present in most plants. It is reasonable to consider that the different natural substances are degraded in soil in accordance with the known metabolic ways in living matter and this degradation leads to simple components also present in the natural environment. It is also underlined that there is no report about pollution by fenugreek seeds near fenugreek crops: during its annual cycle, fenugreek seeds fall from the arborescence at the end of maturation and are scattered on the surrounding ground. The natural substances present in the seeds integrate the natural vegetal cycle to be decomposed into simple components. 'Generally, the harvest of fenugreek seeds reaches 4000 kg per hectare. It is reasonable to consider that, in this case, the level of the seeds debris on the soil is higher than the amount of the plant protection product which falls on the soil after treatment of grapevine, in view of the utilized dose (1.5 kg per hectare).' The risk to non-target organisms was expected to be low for the representative use evaluated.",NA
NA,Risks for public health due to the presence of chlormequat in table grapes from India European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1590,"On 21 April 2010 EFSA received an urgent request from the European Commission to provide a statement on the risks to public health related to the presence of chlormequat residues in table grapes originating from India which may be exceeding the current legal limit established at European level. The European Commission asked EFSA to calculate the threshold residue concentration that will not cause an exceedence of the toxicological threshold for acute exposure (Acute Reference Dose, ARfD) for any of the European Consumer groups in the EFSA PRIMo. Chlormequat is an active substance used as plant growth regulator in plant protection products. Chlormequat was included in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC with the restriction to be used only on cereals and non- edible crops. The MRL for table grapes is therefore set at the limit of quantification (0.05 mg/kg). In the peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC the toxicological profile of chlormequat chloride, the salt used in pesticide formulations, was investigated. The data were sufficient to derive an Acceptable Daily Intake value (ADI) of 0.04 mg/kg bw/d and an ARfD of 0.09 mg/kg. The recalculation of the toxicological reference values for chlormequat cation, taking into account the molecular weight correction factor, leads to an ADI of 0.031 mg/kg bw/d and ARfD of 0.07 mg/kg bw. No information is currently available regarding the source of the chlormequat residues in grapes. In case the residues result from an agricultural use, the metabolism of chlormequat on grapes should be further investigated. In absence of appropriate metabolism studies, the presence of unknown metabolites can not be excluded. In the context of this statement, EFSA had to make the assumption that the residue of concern on grapes comprises only the parent compound chlormequat. The calculated acute threshold residue concentration for chlormequat on table grapes is 1.06 mg/kg. Consequently, EFSA concludes that no acute consumer health risk is expected if table grapes with a mean chlormequat residue concentration of 1.06 mg/kg are consumed. The calculation is based on the most critical European consumer groups (German child, body weight 16.15 kg) eating in one eating occasion 211.5 g of table grapes (13.1 g grapes per kg body weight). The calculation also takes into account a possible inhomogeneous distribution of the residues within the lot of grapes If this threshold concentration of 1.06 mg/kg is exceeded, a potential consumer health risk can not be excluded in case an extreme food consumption event (consumption of more than 13.1 g grapes per kg body weight) coincides with an inhomogeneous residue distribution within the lot from which the table grapes have been taken. EFSA also performed a long-term consumer exposure assessment using the existing MRLs as input parameters in the calculation of the theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI). For table grapes the MRL was replaced with the threshold residue derived in the iterative acute risk assessment. Regarding the long-term exposure, no potential consumer health risk was identified; the exposure accounted for maximum 77% of the ADI. The contribution of the residues in table grapes did not exceed 5% of the ADI. Assuming, there are no other non-authorised uses, it is concluded that the existing MRLs do not pose a long-term consumer health risk. There is a sufficient safety margin to exclude that a slightly higher exposure for a short period due to the consumption of table grapes with higher residues than the existing MRLs would lead to a critical intake situation. The results of the risk assessment have to be taken as provisional and temporary, since a full data package as required for assessing the safety of residues on food resulting from the use of pesticides is not available to EFSA at this time. The following issues have to be clarified before a final risk assessment can be performed: Clarification of the source of the chlormequat residues on table grapes. If it is confirmed that the residues result from an agricultural use, the description of the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) in the country of origin has to be provided. Studies investigating the nature and magnitude of chlormequat residues on grapes in accordance with the use pattern described in the GAP have to be provided. If metabolites are identified in fruit crops, their toxicological relevance has to be clarified, and if relevant, toxicological reference values have to be derived. The residue definition might need to be revised. It is noted that therefore the calculated threshold residue should not be understood as an MRL recommendation, but it is the result of a safety assessment for a certain lot. This value is provided for use by risk managers to decide on risk management actions to be taken in order to protect European consumers with regard to the lots for which the urgent request was sent to EFSA.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance napropamide,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1565,"Napropamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on napropamide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 6 September 2005. The peer review was initiated on 17 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant United Phosphorus. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in April - May 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in October 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February - March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 140). Following the Commission Decision of 7 November 2008 (2008/902/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of napropamide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant United Phosphorus made a resubmission application for the inclusion of napropamide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/112/08) as follows: Leaching of metabolites to groundwater The minimum purity can not be concluded The impurity specification can not be concluded and concerns were identified with regard to: Groundwater contamination of the active substance in the Southern EU No risk assessment for aquatic organisms available A potential risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Denmark, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 29 June 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 30 June 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 13 August 2009. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on napropamide. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of napropamide as a pre-planting herbicide on head cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, calabrese, tomatoes and oilseed rape. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Devrinol SC 450', a suspension concentrate (SC), registered under different trade names in Europe. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of napropamide. It should be noted that the residue definition for water is not finalised, and therefore further methods could be required in the future. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In the mammalian metabolism studies, napropamide was rapidly and extensively absorbed (> 90 %), and widely distributed. Extensive metabolism and enterohepatic circulation were observed as biliary excretion was a major pathway, and then excretion was rapid through urine and faeces. Fifteen metabolites were identified, and only < 0.5 % of the dose was recovered as the parent compound. Napropamide has low acute toxicity, and no classification is proposed related to acute toxicity testing including irritancy and sensitisation. The critical effect observed in short-term and long-term studies was decreased body weight. Two out of six in vitro gene mutation assays showed positive effects, as well as one weak positive effect was observed for DNA damage and repair in mammalian cells out of five chromosomal tests, but the three in vivo tests were all negative. Overall, no genotoxic potential is attributed to napropamide. No potential for carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity was observed. No adverse effects on fertility or on reproductive parameters were observed, except for a higher abortion rate at maternally toxic doses in rabbits, which could not be ruled out as being a substance-related effect. No foetotoxicity or teratogenicity was evidenced. The relevant short-term NOAEL was the dose level of 50 mg/kg bw/day from the 1-year oral toxicity study in dogs and the 90-day oral study in rats, and the overall relevant long-term NOAEL was set at 30 mg/kg bw/day derived from both 2-year rat studies. The toxicological hazard assessment of the metabolite NOPA according to the guidance document on the relevance of metabolites in groundwater, using the available data, indicates that this metabolite is not relevant, and that the ADI of the parent compound is applicable to this metabolite if groundwater concentrations would exceed the trigger value of 0.75 mu g/L. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of napropamide is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/day, based on the long-term rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100; the acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study and a safety factor of 100. No acute reference dose (ARfD) is allocated. The estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL when no personal protective equipment (PPE) is used according to the German model estimates; according to the UK POEM model, operator exposure is below the AOEL when gloves are worn during mixing/loading and application. No risk is anticipated for workers or bystanders. Napropamide is extensively metabolised in plants. More than 10 metabolites have been identified, but their individual concentration levels are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg. Considering the low consumer exposure and the toxicological profile of the compound, the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring is proposed to be restricted to the parent compound only. Supervised residue trials confirmed that maximum residue limits (MRLs) can be set at the analytical limit of quantification (0.01* mg/kg) for all representative uses. Investigation of the effect of processing on residues is not needed. Livestock exposure is minimal, and a residue definition for animal commodities is not necessary. A potential transfer of soil residues of napropamide above 0.01 mg/kg is present for root crops for plant back intervals up to 180 days. No risk for the consumer resulting from the presence of napropamide residues in plant commodities has been identified. However, the consumer exposure to the metabolite NOPA present in drinking water could not be finalised, as the assessment of the levels that might be present in groundwater is not finalised. In soil under aerobic conditions napropamide exhibits moderate to very high persistence, forming the minor non-transient soil metabolite NOPA (accounting for a maximum of 5.78% of the applied radioactivity (AR) in 30 degrees C incubations and 1.1% AR in 20 degrees C incubations), which exhibits low persistence. It should be noted that the database is limited, and further data are necessary to further clarify the persistence of napropamide (southern European field studies). Mineralisation of the 1-naphthyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted for only 5% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 12.7-14.7 % AR after 90 days. Napropamide exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, while metabolite NOPA exhibits high mobility in soil. The adsorption behaviour of NOPA was pH dependant (lower adsorption as soil pH increased). In dark natural sediment water systems napropamide partitioned relatively slowly from water to sediment where it degraded, exhibiting high to very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 3.6 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were the major sink, representing 11-19 % AR at study end. In a laboratory aqueous photolysis study napropamide was photolysed to 4 major metabolites (all identified). The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (including the potential for accumulation in sediment) using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach are available. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by napropamide above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low under the geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. For the metabolite NOPA further assessment is required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment. However, based on the available simulations, that use too favourable input parameters, it is clear that a groundwater non-relevance assessment is triggered, and NOPA concentrations will be > 0.75 mu g/L. From the mammalian toxicological point of view, sufficient information is available to conclude on the nonrelevance of NOPA. However, a consumer risk assessment would be required before a conclusion on groundwater non-relevance of NOPA could be finalised, and this requires the estimates of potential levels in groundwater to be finalised. The risk to birds was assessed as low for all representative uses. The first-tier long-term TER value of 4.5 was below the trigger of 5 for the use on tomatoes. It was agreed that the risk to insectivorous birds is likely to be low, because the end point (NOEC reproduction) is based on the highest tested dose, and that a certain proportion of the insect prey would consist of large insects (lower residues compared to small insects). The risk to earthworm-eating and fish-eating birds from secondary poisoning was assessed as low. The risk to mammals is considered to be low for the representative uses. The long-term TERs for insectivorous mammals and earthworm-eating mammals were below the trigger of 5 for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes). The submitted information gave some indication that the proportion of time spent feeding in the treated area (PT) is likely to be considerably lower than assumed in the firsttier risk assessment. In a weight of evidence approach it was agreed that the risk to insectivorous and earthworm-eating mammals is low. The risk from plant metabolites was considered to be addressed by the risk assessment for the parent napropamide. Napropamide is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The risk assessment for aquatic organisms is driven by the toxicity to Lemna gibba. The refinement based on a study containing sediment in the test system was not accepted by the experts in the PRAPeR 33 meeting. The end points to be used in the risk assessment were discussed, since several studies with Lemna species and different aquatic invertebrate species were available. The experts suggested using in the aquatic risk assessment the end point of 0.067 mg a.s./L, and a geometric mean value of 5.4 mg a.s./L, for macrophytes and invertebrates, respectively. The risk to aquatic organisms (excluding rooted aquatic macrophytes) was assessed as low based on FOCUS step 3 PECsw values for the representative use on brassicas. Two full FOCUS scenarios out of 6 resulted in TER values above the trigger of 10 for Lemna (D4 and R1) for the use on winter oilseed rape, and no full FOCUS scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 10 for the use on tomatoes. No major metabolites in surface water were identified in the water/sediment study. However, the experts on environmental fate and behaviour agreed that the parent compound, as well as 5 different photolysis metabolites and NOPA (where groundwater becomes surface water) should be considered for risk assessment. The risk assessment from the metabolite NOPA remains open since the PECgw is not finalised. In addition, data gaps were identified to address the risk to macrophytes rooted in the sediment, and to refine the risk to aquatic organisms for the use in southern Europe (tomatoes), with e.g. FOCUS step 4 calculations. The risk of bioconcentration in fish was assessed as low. The risk to earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low for the uses in northern Europe, but is not finalised for the use in southern Europe. The risk to soil functioning (organic matter breakdown) was assessed as low for northern European uses (brassicas and oilseed rape), but cannot be excluded for the higher application rates for the southern European use on tomatoes. The risk to bees, non-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flonicamidle,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1445,"Flonicamid is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC3 France received an application from ISK Biosciences for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2004/686/EC4 Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State France made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on flonicamid, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 24 May 2005. The peer review was initiated on 3 June 2005 by dispatching the DAR (France, 2005) for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in February -March 2007. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in November 2006, January 2007 and April to May 2009. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States (in November 2009) leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprise foliar spraying to control aphids, in the early developmental phase of the population, from early spring till unearly summer, in potatoes, wheat, apples and pears in all EU countries and in peaches in Southern Europe, up to maximum 2-3 treatments per year, at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 70-80 g as/ha with an interval of 21days between applications. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Teppeki', a water dispersible granule (WG) containing 50% flonicamid. The technical specification is open waiting for further justification. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Flonicamid is rapidly and almost completely absorbed but not extensively metabolised, and excreted mainly via urine. It is harmful after acute oral administration (Xn R22 ""Harmful if swallowed""). After repeated administration, the target organs were the liver, the kidneys and the haematopoietic system. No potential genotoxicity has been shown, and no carcinogenic effect was observed in rats. However in mice, the relevance of lung tumours for humans was not clearly dismissed and the classification has to be discussed by ECHA. No adverse effects on the reproductive parameters were observed in the rat, but indications of foetotoxicity in both rats and rabbits lead to the proposal Repr.Cat.3 R63? (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"": with a question mark). Some metabolites identified in the rat metabolism were tested and considered of lower toxicity than flonicamid. The agreed acceptable daily intake (ADI), acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) and acute reference dose (ARfD) are 0.025 mg/kg bw/day, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values are 7.46% for the concentrate and 13% for the spray dilution. According to the German model, the estimated operator exposure is below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment for both applications in field crops and orchards. The worker exposure is 5.7% of the AOEL if standard clothing and gloves are worn. The bystander exposure is < 1% of the AOEL for the use on potatoes and 14% of the AOEL during orchard application. Metabolism of flonicamid was studied in wheat, potato, peach and additionally on pepper. The metabolism was shown to be comparable in all crops investigated and the residues mainly composed of flonicamid and metabolites TFNG and TFNA, but in significant different ratios depending on the crop. Considering that the additional metabolites TFNA-AM and TFNG-AM are not expected to be present in plants in significant levels, the residue definition for risk assessment was finally limited to the sum of ""flonicamid, TFNA, TFNG expressed as flonicamid"". Two options were proposed to define the residue for monitoring; as ""flonicamid only"" or as ""sum flonicamid, TFNA; TFNG expressed as flonicamid"". The submitted residue trials where samples were analysed for flonicamid, TFNA, TFNG and TFNA-AM, allowed to derive MRLs according the two proposed residue definitions for monitoring, and to derive conversion factor for risk assessment when the residue is defined as the parent compound only. Metabolism of flonicamid was also studied in livestock. Having regard to the additional excretion study conducted with C-14-TFNA on rat, the experts in the PRAPeR 70 meeting agreed to define the residue for monitoring and risk assessment as ""sum flonicamid, TFNA-AM expressed as flonicamid"". Based on the feeding studies performed with a mixture 1/1 of flonicamid/TFNG a global MRL of 0.02* mg/kg was proposed for products of animal origin. No rotational crop data were required, the degradation of flonicamid and its metabolites in soil being extremely rapid. The chronic and acute risk assessment performed using the EFSA PRIMO rev. 2 model shows consumer exposure below the ADI and ARfD. In soil under aerobic conditions flonicamid exhibits very low to low persistence rapidly forming the major soil metabolites TFNA, TFNA-OH and TFNG-AM and the minor soil metabolites TFNG and TFNA-AM which also exhibit very low or low persistence. Mineralisation to carbon dioxide accounted for 47-57 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 30 days (study end). The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 30-43% AR at study end. Flonicamid and its 5 identified soil metabolites exhibit very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either flonicamid or its 5 identified soil metabolites was pH dependant. In 2 natural sediment water systems flonicamid dissipated exhibiting moderate persistence in water. In the total system flonicamid also exhibited moderate persistence. In the water phase of 1 system two metabolites were identified TFNA and TFNA-OH as being present at levels that justified their inclusion in the aquatic risk assessment. The terminal metabolite, CO2, was the most significant degradation product accounting for 16-59 % AR at 136-145 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink for radioactivity representing 38-75 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for flonicamid and the five identified metabolites at steps 1 and 2. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent flonicamid and its 5 identified soil metabolites TFNA, TFNA-OH, TFNA-AM, TFNG and TFNG-AM, was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The risk to non-target organisms was assessed as low for all groups of non-target organisms. The first-tier HQ values for acute oral and contact exposure of bees were far below the trigger of 50 indicating a low risk. However adverse effects on bees were observed in some of the additionally submitted tunnel tests e.g. altered feeding behaviour (avoidance) and increased mortality of bees when bees were present during spraying. Therefore the RMS suggested to restrict the use to periods of no flowering for uses in apples/pears and peaches and additional information may be required (bee brood feeding study) if other authorizations e.g. in oilseed-rape are granted at MSs level.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance buprofezin European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1624,"Buprofezin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR for buprofezin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 7 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 2 February 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May -June 2007 and in December 2007. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with Member States in February -March 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion fmalised on 3 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 128). Following the Commission Decision of 30 September 2008 (2008/771/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of buprofezin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd made a resubmission application for the inclusion of buprofezin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/110/08 -rev. final) as follows: the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to: the substantial lack of data to assess the consumer exposure, which is regarded as inconclusive the substantial lack of data to assess the risk to soil-dwelling macro-organisms and concerns were identified with regard to: the consumer exposure In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 21 August 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 24 August 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 8 October 2009. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on buprofezin. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of buprofezin as an insecticide and acaricide on tomatoes, lettuce and citrus, with a modification for the use on lettuce only. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Applaud 25 WP"", a wettable powder formulation (WP). Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor buprofezin residues in all matrices. In mammals, the acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity of buprofezin is low (oral and dermal LD5 0 > 2000 mg/kg bw, LC50 4.57 mg/L air/4h). Buprofezin is not a skin or eye irritant, nor a skin sensitiser. Target organs in subchronic and chronic studies are the liver and thyroid, showing increased weight, and histological and clinical chemistry findings. The relevant short-term NOAEL in rats is 13 mg/kg bw/day, while in dogs the relevant NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant long-term toxicity NOAEL in rats is 0.9 mg/kg bw/day, while in mice it is 1.82 mg/kg bw/day. The genotoxicity of buprofezin was discussed in an opinion of the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) based on a new micronucleus test in the bone marrow of mouse, showing the induction of micronuclei in the erythrocytes of mouse bone marrow when administered by oral gavage, once daily, for two consecutive days. The Panel considered buprofezin non-genotoxic, and the in vivo micronucleus test on bone marrow as not interpretable. The PPR Panel re-evaluated also the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on buprofezin and concluded that buprofezin is not carcinogenic in rats or mice. Buprofezin did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: the relevant parental and offspring NOAELs are 6.46 mg/kg bw/day and 9.21 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The reproductive NOAEL is 66 mg/kg bw/day. As for teratogenicity studies, overall, the NOAEL for both maternal and foetal effects is 50 mg/kg bw/day (based on decreased food consumption and increased water intake, and decreased foetal weight, skeletal effects and subcutaneous oedema, respectively). It was agreed not to propose any classification. Buprofezin does not have potential to induce neurotoxicity in mammals. The Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day is based on the relevant NOAEL of 0.9 mg/kg bw/day from the 24-month study in rats, with a safety factor of 100. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100 and a correction for oral absorption of 40 %. The Acute Reference Dose is 0.5 mg/kg bw, based on the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study and applying a safety factor of 100. The operator exposure was below the AOEL for tractor-mounted spraying with personal protective equipment (PPE) for tomatoes and citrus, calculated with the German model. For hand-held application, the exposure was below the AOEL with PPE for tomatoes outdoors (UK-POEM). The exposure was below the AOEL with PPE/RPE for hand-held application for tomatoes and lettuce in glasshouse (Dutch model), and for hand-held application in citrus (German model). For bystanders the estimated exposure levels were below the AOEL (< 15%), for both field applications on tomatoes and citrus; bystander exposure for application in greenhouses is unlikely. The worker exposure was estimated to be below the AOEL with gloves when handling tomatoes or lettuce in glasshouse, or tomatoes outdoors. However, the exposure was above the AOEL even with gloves when handling citrus. The metabolism of buprofezin in plants has been elucidated in three plant groups (fruit crops, leafy crops and oilseed/pulse crops). The parent compound is the major constituent of the final residue, accounting for 47 -89 % of the TRR for pre-harvest intervals (PHIs) < 27 days. The residues in plants are mainly composed of the parent compound and the sugar conjugates of the metabolite BF4, which are identified as BF9 and BF12 under acidic analysis conditions, or as BF26 when the analytical procedures include neutral or alkaline steps. Therefore, the residues were defined as, buprofezinY' only for monitoring, and as, sum of buprofezin and BF4 conjugates analysed as BF9 and BF 12 under acidic hydrolysis and expressed as buprofezin"" for risk assessment. Maximum residue limits (MRLs) are proposed for tomatoes and citrus, however a complete residue data set is requested for all representative uses in order to derive appropriate conversion factors (CF) for risk assessment, and to propose an MRL for indoor lettuce. Provisionally, and based on the metabolism studies, a CF of 1.5 is proposed for fruit crops. Based on new studies, processing factors are proposed for citrus and tomato. However, a data gap is identified concerning the possible transfer of the metabolite aniline, especially in processed fractions subject to pasteurisation or sterilisation. A potential transfer of residues to rotational crops has been noted. Based on the representative uses, no residues are expected in animal commodities, and no residue definitions and MRL are proposed for products of animal origin. Even if the toxicological profile of some metabolites is not fully addressed, with some of them considered to be of similar or of higher toxicity than the parent compound, the consumer risk assessment gives sufficient margin to conclude on the absence of chronic or acute concerns for the consumer, with the refined calculated intakes being below 10 % of the toxicological reference values. It should be noted that lettuce was not considered in this assessment, since the residue trials were not performed according to the critical GAP and are not appropriate to propose an MRL for this crop. In addition, the assessment for tomatoes and citrus has to be considered provisional, pending the submission of new residue trials on tomatoes and citrus in order to derive sound conversion factors for risk assessment. In soil under aerobic conditions buprofezin exhibits medium to high persistence. Mineralisation of the phenyl ring to carbon dioxide accounted for 19-51 % applied radioactivity (AR) after 90 -98 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 23-33 % AR after 90-98 days. Only minor (< 5% AR) metabolites were formed. Buprofezin exhibits slight mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of buprofezin was pH dependent. In dark natural sediment water systems buprofezin degraded exhibiting moderate persistence in both water and sediment, forming the metabolite BF 10 in water (max. 12 % AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance, accounting for a maximum of 18 % AR at 91 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were also a sink representing 14-15 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out (including some updated calculations for sediment presented in the Additional Report), using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for buprofezin at steps 1-3 for tomatoes, and steps 1-4 for citrus, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. For the metabolite BF10 appropriate FOCUS step 1 and 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses by buprofezin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 gg/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The acute and long-term risk to birds and mammals from the representative uses of buprofezin was assessed as low. The risk assessment for small herbivorous mammals in citrus plantations assumed an interception rate of 70 %, resulting in a TER value that exceeded the Annex VI trigger value. A low risk was also identified for birds and mammals exposed via the ingestion of contaminated earthworms or fish, or via contaminated drinking water. Buprofezin is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Low risk was identified from the use of buprofezin on tomatoes. However, the application in citrus plantations requires a no-spray-buffer zone of 21 metres when applied adjacent to edge-of-field water courses. The risk to sediment-dwelling organisms was assessed as low from the representative field uses of buprofezin. Buprofezin is not considered to bioaccumulate in fish. Low risk was identified for all other non-target organisms.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance zinc phosphide European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1671,"Zinc phosphide is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20043, as amended by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, Germany, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS) submitted an initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR) on zinc phosphide. The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 24e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of zinc phosphide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/ EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 8 December 2008 (2008/941/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of zinc phosphide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the Zinc Phosphide Pool made a resubmission application for the inclusion of zinc phosphide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Germany, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 22 October 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 9 November 2009. The DAR was also distributed for comments. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 4 January 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on zinc phosphide. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of zinc phosphide as a rodenticide in forestry, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'ARREX E Koder', a ready-for-use bait (RB) formulation. Sufficient analytical methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor zinc phosphide residues as phosphine in plant commodities with high water content, in animal products, in soil, and in surface and ground water. The data available on mammalian toxicology are sufficient to carry out the human health assessments at EU level for the representative use. No significant residues in plant or animal matrices are expected based on the product being applied in a targeted manner. Therefore consumer risk assessments are not required. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use. Based on the insignificant exposure expected from the intended mode of application, the risk to birds and non- target mammals was assessed as low. Based on the negligible exposure expected from the representative use of zinc phosphide, the risk to aquatic organisms, bees, non- target arthropods, earthworms, non- target soil macro-and micro-organisms, non-target plants, and the function of waste water treatment plants was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1704,"Bromuconazole is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bromuconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 14 November 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 5 May 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience (later Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe SAS). Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and remaining issues were agreed during a written procedure in February - March 2007. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in July and October 2007. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in February-March 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 26 March 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 136). Following the Commission Decision of 3 November 2008 (2008/832/EC)4 concerning the non-inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Sumitomo Chemical Agro Europe S.A. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bromuconazole in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the areas of concern identified in the review report (SANCO/120/08) as follows: the potential for contamination of surface water and groundwater; the high toxicity to aquatic organisms. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on bromuconazole in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 8 October 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 20 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 7 December 2009. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of ecotoxicology and to deliver its conclusions on bromuconazole. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a fungicide on wheat. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the same representative use. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was, Granit 200 SC."", a suspension concentrate formulation (SC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of bromuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In mammals, bromuconazole oral LD50 is 328 mg/kg bw (classification as, harmful if swallowed. (Xn; R22), proposed). The acute toxicity by the dermal and inhalation routes is low (LD50>2000 mg/kg bw and LC50 > 5 mg/L). Bromuconazole is neither a skin nor an eye irritant. It is not a skin sensitiser. In repeated dose toxicity studies, the liver is the target organ. In subchronic tests, the dog is the most sensitive species, with an overall relevant NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day, whereas in rat the NOAEL is 13.8 mg/kg bw/day. In genotoxicity testing there was some indication of weak clastogenicity in vitro, however there was no indication of positive results in vivo, neither in the micronucleus assay nor in the UDS assay. Overall, bromuconazole was considered devoid of genotoxic potential. The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity in rat is 0.88 mg/kg bw/day: treatment-related neoplastic lesions in rodents occurred at high doses: hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas in rats and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. In both rats and mice, the tumours were likely caused by liver toxicity and subsequent cell renewal. Overall, it was agreed that bromuconazole does not have carcinogenic potential relevant to humans. Bromuconazole did not show any reproductive toxicity potential: parental and foetal toxicity NOAELs were established at 1.3 mg/kg bw/day, while the reproductive NOAEL was established at 141 mg/kg bw/day. As for developmental toxicity, in the rat the relevant maternal NOAEL is 70 mg/kg bw/day, whereas the developmental NOAEL is 10 mg/kg bw/day, based on a dose-dependent increase of placental weight and ossification delays or supernumerary bones in a number of skeletal structures. It was agreed to propose classification Cat 3, Xn; R63,, May cause harm to unborn child.. The ADI of 0.01 mg/kg bw/day was set based on the relevant long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity NOAEL of 0.88 mg/kg bw/day from the 2-year rat study, applying a safety factor (SF) of 100. For the ARfD, the value is based on the developmental NOAEL of 10 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study, with a SF of 100, leading to an ARfD of 0.1 mg/kg bw. The AOEL of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day was set on basis of the NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the 90-day dog study (applying a standard SF of 100). The operator exposure assessment showed exposure levels below the AOEL (15.6%) according to the German model with the use of gloves during mixing/loading and application, and coveralls and sturdy footwear during application. The estimated exposure for re-entry activities (scouting) is 4.5% of the AOEL. The bystander exposure is estimated to be 1.6% of the AOEL. The metabolism of bromuconazole was investigated in wheat. Additional metabolism data were submitted for the category of fruit crops. A metabolic pathway could be established in cereals. At harvest, bromuconazole was still a major part of the terminal residue in cereal matrices, and identified metabolites were individually below 10% of the total residue. However, there was an indication of preferential metabolism of one bromuconazole diastereomer (LS 850647), as a significant shift in the ratio of diastereomers was found in the residues determined in the mature cereal crop when compared to the ratio in the initially applied bromuconazole. Whether the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was subject to any shift was not investigated. In rotational crops studies there was uptake of residues from soil into succeeding cereal, oilseed, root and leafy crops. Upon analysis of the residues the two bromuconazole diastereomers were identified as major residue, and similar to the primary cereal metabolism their ratio had been shifted compared to the one in the bromuconazole applied to the soil. No information is available on the ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer. The submitted livestock metabolism data in ruminants and poultry allows to establish a metabolic pathway, and suggests that no residues in food of animal origin above the limit of quantification are expected when cereals treated according to the cGAP are used in livestock diet. The data imply that there might be preferential metabolism of one diastereomer also in livestock animals. The ratio of enantiomers in each diastereomer was not investigated. As plant and livestock residue data indicate that from the representative use no significant consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues is expected, the observed shift of the isomer ratio in the terminal residue is currently not a concern with regard to consumer safety. This may have to be reconsidered when authorisation of uses is sought that lead to consumer exposure to bromuconazole residues above the limit of quantification. The meeting of experts noted that all studies were performed using phenyl-labelled bromuconazole only, and thus the fate of the triazole moiety of the molecule was not investigated. The experts agreed that, based on the available data and information, cleavage of the molecule cannot be excluded and further investigation of the triazole moiety of the molecule is required to address consumer exposure to potential metabolites originating from molecule breakdown, as e.g. triazole derivative metabolites. Until then, the plant and animal residue definition is provisional. Triazole derivative metabolites are considered of concern due to their toxicological profile. In the absence of data investigating the fate of the triazole moiety of the bromuconzole molecule and the magnitude of potentially occurring metabolites originating from the triazole moiety, the consumer exposure cannot be assessed and consequently the consumer risk assessment is not finalised. As a breakdown of the bromuconazole molecule leading to the occurrence of metabolites relevant to consumer safety cannot be excluded, the issue is regarded as a critical area of concern. In soil under aerobic conditions bromuconazole exhibits moderate to very high persistence forming several minor (< 10% AR) metabolites. Mineralisation was limited accounting for only 1-4.4% AR after 100-120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 5-17.6 % AR after 100-120 days. A laboratory soil photolysis study indicated that photolysis may contribute to the degradation of bromuconazole at the soil surface. As a consequence, the experts agreed that the available field dissipation rates did not represent biodegradation that can be used as input to FOCUS modelling. However, following the resubmission application, field degradation rates normalised to FOCUS reference conditions that excluded photolysis losses were estimated. These estimates are considered appropriate for use as input to FOCUS modelling. Bromuconazole exhibits medium to low mobility in soil. Bromuconazole is essentially stable to hydrolysis, and photolysis is not expected to be a significant process in the breakdown of bromuconazole in natural aquatic systems. In dark natural sediment water systems bromuconazole partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.9 % AR at 100 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented maximum 15% AR at study end. Satisfactory FOCUS surface water exposure estimates were available for use in the EU level aquatic risk assessment, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being accounted for in step 4 calculations. The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from the representative use assessed, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic conditions represented by all 9 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Bromuconazole belongs to the group of triazole fungicides that are suspected to have potential endocrine disrupting properties. No information was provided to address this point with regard to the potential effects on birds and fish, and a data gap was identified. No new information on this point was provided in the Additional Report and the data gap remains. The TER values for herbivorous birds were all above the Annex VI triggers, indicating a low risk for herbivorous birds. Also for insectivorous birds the TER values for acute and short-term exposure were well above the trigger, however the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5, indicating a potential high long-term risk. In the Additional Report higher tier studies (mainly from open literature) were presented to select the focal species and to determine the proportion of different food types (PD) of the focal species. Two different approaches were used to refine the risk assessment. The first approach included the selection of representative focal species, and estimations of PD for these species. The second approach was to include the decline of residues in insects (f(twa) = 0.53) in the first-tier long-term risk assessment. The TERlt values based on the PD refinements, and those based on the use of ftwa of decline of residues in insects, were all above the Annex VI trigger values. Therefore the long-term risk to insectivorous birds was assessed as low. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating birds was assessed as low. The acute TERs for herbivorous and insectivorous mammals were above the Annex VI trigger of 10 (including refinement of residues in plant material), however the long-term TERs were below the Annex VI trigger, indicating a high risk. The choice of the long-term end point was discussed again in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was agreed that the NOAEL for mammals of 13.8 mg as/kg bw/d is the relevant ecotoxicological end point. TER calculations for insectivorous mammals based on this NOAEL are provided in the DAR and in the Additional Report and were above the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a low long-term risk for insectivorous mammals. In the resubmission, a higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was based on the rabbit as focal species in late cereal growth stages. The higher tier risk assessment for herbivorous mammals was discussed in the experts. meeting (PRAPeR 75), and it was concluded that the available information is not sufficient to address the potential high long-term risk for herbivorous mammals. The risk to earthworm- and fish-eating mammals was assessed as low. Bromuconazole is very toxic to aquatic organisms. The applicant provided a bridging study with the new formulation SCAE0307 and Daphnia magna. The formulation SCAE0307 is less toxic than the previously assessed formulation EXP 10064-B, and has a toxicity comparable to that of the active substance. Member States experts at PRAPeR 75 agreed that the end points for the active substance should be used in the risk assessment. A low long-term risk was identified from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values in the D3 ditch, D4 pond, D4 stream, D5 pond, D5 stream, D6 pond, R1 pond and R1 stream scenarios. However, a potential high long-term risk was indicated for aquatic invertebrates from the FOCUS step3 PECsw values for the D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream, R3 stream and R4 stream scenarios, and further refinement was needed. The TERs were re-calculated with a 10m no-spray buffer zone for the drainage scenarios and a 10m no-spray buffer zone including a vegetated filter strip to mitigate the run-off. The long-term TER values were above 10 in 2 full FOCUS run-off scenarios (R3 stream and R4 stream). However, the TER values estimated with the drainage scenarios D1 ditch, D1 stream, D2 ditch, D2 stream were below the Annex VI trigger values even with a 10m no-spray buffer zone. Overall, taking into account the FOCUS step 3 and 4 scenarios, it can be concluded that the risk of bromuconazole to aquatic organisms was assessed as low for more than the half of the scenarios. The risk assessment for non-target arthropods was not in accordance with the ESCORT II scheme. The standard glass plate tests suggest that there will be some adverse effects on sensitive non-target arthropods. Extended laboratory studies gave an indication that the risk to non-target arthropods is low. Concerns were raised with regard to the comparability of the different formulations used in the studies with non-target arthropods. EFSA agrees to the assessment of the RMS that the formulations are sufficiently similar to conclude on the risk to non-target arthropods for the representative use. The applicant informed that a different formulation than Granit will be marketed. It is suggested that a risk assessment for this formulation is conducted at Member State level after the decision on Annex I inclusion. The formulation Granit had no significant effect on organic matter decomposition over a six months period in a litter bag test at an application rate of 180 g a.s./ha and 500 g a.s./ha. The soil concentration was calculated in the DAR as 0.67 mg a.s./ha. This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). In conclusion, the risk of bromuconazole to non-target macro-organisms was assessed as low. Effects of > 25% on nitrogen transformation were observed at an application rate of 400 g a.s./ha (0.53 mg a.s./kg soil). This concentration covers the plateau maximum PECsoil of 0.232 mg a.s./kg soil (2 x 0.200 kg a.s./ha). The risk of bromuconazole to soil non-target micro-organisms was assessed as low. The risk to bees, earthworms, non-target plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clethodim,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1771,"Clethodim is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as, the Commission.), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by The Netherlands, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant. s decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of clethodim in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of clethodim in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Arysta LifeScience made a resubmission application for the inclusion of clethodim in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, The Netherlands, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 1 December 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 3 December 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 18 January 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and environmental fate and behaviour, and deliver its conclusions on clethodim. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of clethodim as a herbicide on sugar beet, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. A data gap is identified with regard to the formulation in the section physical and chemical properties. No critical areas of concern are identified in the mammalian toxicology section. Data gaps are identified for an assessment of the relative toxicity of the plant metabolites M17R, M18R and M15R in comparison to clethodim, and for an assessment of the toxicological relevance of some groundwater metabolites. The representative uses of clethodim in sugar beet are not considered to result in a high risk to the consumer. The identified data gaps are not expected to significantly alter this conclusion, since the exposure of the consumer to residues in sugar beet is in general very low. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses, with the notable exception for experimental degradation rates in soil and soil adsorption values for the two soil photolysis metabolites 2-[3-chloroallyloxyimino] butanoic acid and trans-3-chloroacrylic acid to address the soil and groundwater exposure assessments of the two photodegradates. A data gap is also identified for the characterisation of the chromatographic peak M20 found in a soil metabolism study in order to support the exclusion of the content of this peak from the overall quantification of metabolite clethodim oxazole sulfoxide. In case this fraction is part (one of the isomers) of clethodim oxazole sulfoxide and the quantitative determination makes the metabolite occur at more than 5 % at two consecutive time points, then a groundwater assessment would be needed. The potential for groundwater exposure by the metabolites clethodim sulfone and clethodim oxazole sulfone is predicted to be high over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. On the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data, the metabolites clethodim sulfone and clethodim oxazole sulfone were considered to be toxicologically non-relevant. The risk for earthworm-eating birds and mammals was assessed as high at first tier for soils with pH < 5.5, indicating the need for further refinement, therefore a data gap has been identified and the issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern. The long-term risk for insectivorous birds was assessed as high after a refinement for the southern Europe use of 384 g a. s./ ha, and therefore a data gap was identified. Clethodim technical is toxic to aquatic organisms. Based on the data for the formulation, a high risk was identified for the majority of scenarios at FOCUS step 3 for all the representative uses. The TER values are expected to still be below the Annex VI trigger at FOCUS step 4 in the majority of scenarios, with a no-spray buffer zone up to 30m, for the southern Europe use of 384 g a. s./ ha. Data to further refine the risk are needed. At FOCUS step 4 the risk was low with a no-spray buffer zone up to 18 m for the southern Europe use of 2x192 g a. s./ ha, except for the R3stream scenario. For the northern Europe use of 300 g a. s./ ha, the risk was assessed as low with a nospray buffer zone up to 30m, except for the D3-ditch and R3-stream scenarios. The risk was assessed as low for bees, non-target arthropods, soil macro-and micro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment.

The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of pencycuron as a fungicide on potatoes, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A to this report. A data gap is identified in the section physical and chemical properties of the formulation. No data gaps or critical areas of concern are identified in the mammalian toxicology section. In the residues area, for the specific use on potatoes at planting, the pertinent issues for consumer risk assessment have been reasonably addressed and no data gaps or critical areas of concern are identified. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative use, with the notable exception that information is missing regarding the fate and behaviour of the chlorophenyl and cyclopentyl portions of the molecule in soil, and the chlorophenyl and phenyl portions of the molecule in natural surface water and sediment systems. Consequently, the soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment exposure assessments for metabolites that have the potential to be formed from these portions of the molecule could not be finalised. A high long-term risk to large omnivorous mammals (wild boar) was indicated in the refined risk assessment. This issue has been regarded as a critical area of concern and a data gap has been identified. The risk assessments for non-target organisms in relation to metabolites in soil, groundwater when it becomes surface water, surface water and sediment could not be finalised in view of the data gaps for further information on the nature and level of the metabolites in these environmental matrices.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carboxin European Food Safety Authority,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1857,"Carboxin is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4).

The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of carboxin as a fungicide on cereals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps are identified in the section identity and analytical methods. A critical area of concern is identified for the technical specification. For mammalian toxicology, a critical area of concern is identified, as based on the available information the batches tested in the mammalian toxicology section could not be considered toxicologically equivalent to the currently proposed technical specification (which was not agreed by the physical-chemical section). As classification with R40 (carcinogen category 3) is proposed for carboxin, the groundwater metabolites are considered toxicologically relevant. It is noted that the sulfone metabolite of carboxin is the active substance oxycarboxin, which is relevant being an active substance with pesticidal activity. For residues no critical areas of concern are identified. However, the risk assessment cannot be finalised as there is a data gap identified for rotational crops. The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater exposure by several metabolites is predicted to be high over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. It should be noted that one of these metabolites (oxycarboxin) is a pesticide active substance (fungicide). As all metabolites are considered toxicologically relevant, a critical area of concern has been identified. A data gap remains to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds and mammals, and herbivorous mammals for the representative uses of carboxin as a seed treatment. This has been considered to be a critical area of concern. In addition, a data gap is identified to address the risk to birds and mammals from the representative formulation. For all other groups of non-target organisms the risk was assessed as low without the need for further refinements or risk mitigation measures.",NA

Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A. No area of concern or data gap was identified in the physical chemical properties section. No area of concern or data gap was identified in the mammalian toxicology section. For residues there are no critical areas of concern and the risk assessment is finalised. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level, for the representative uses assessed, however it should be noted that the assessment is specific to the particular formulated product 'Metarex' only. It is therefore inappropriate to extrapolate the environmental exposure assessment presented to any other products containing metaldehyde. The potential for groundwater exposure by metaldehyde, from the representative uses of the formulated product 'Metarex' in cereals and spring sown oilseed rape, above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all the pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios (up to 9). For the representative use of 'Metarex' on autumn sown (winter) oilseed rape, the modelling results for 5 out of the 6 FOCUS groundwater scenarios indicated a low potential for groundwater exposure above 0.1 mu g/L. Under the geoclimatic conditions represented by the Piacenza scenario, contamination of groundwater by parent metaldehyde above 0.1 mu g/L cannot be excluded. A high acute and long-term risk was assessed for birds and mammals. A data gap was identified to provide new acute and long-term risk assessments for birds from all routes of exposure for all representative uses. Moreover, a data gap was identified to provide a new acute and long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals for all representative uses.

The preferential metabolism/degradation of each stereoisomer in plants, animals (diclofop-methyl and probably diclofop) and the environment (diclofop only), and the possible impact on the toxicity, worker and consumer risk assessment, and the environment were not investigated in the studies submitted in the dossier and needs to be addressed. A data gap was identified in the toxicology section for a study on acute toxicity by inhalation performed with the representative formulation. No critical area of concern was raised. The nature of the residues in cereal crops has not been confirmed because the metabolism studies submitted could not be considered acceptable. Therefore no further areas of the risk assessment could be concluded upon. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour in the environment are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level. For the representative uses assessed, contamination of groundwater above the parametric drinking water standard (0.1 mu g/L) is not expected for diclofop-methyl, diclofop or diclofop-phenol. The risk to herbivorous birds and mammals from potential plant metabolites remains to be addressed, based on a valid plant metabolism study.

For the section on physical-chemical properties no critical areas of concern were identified. Data gaps were identified for quality control data to support the specification, for a final report of the validation for two impurities for the level of ethoxylation of formulants and ILV data for products of animal origin. A data gap was identified for the toxicological profile of the metabolites found in fruit residues consisting of 4-tert-butyl-cyclohexanol and its derivatives, and aminodiol. A data gap was identified for the diastereomer ratio found in plant residues to which workers are exposed. Worker exposure to "" Prosper EC 500"" after 3 applications in grapes exceeds the AOEL even when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered and applying a 50% decrease in residues between each application (7 days interval). Metabolism in plant was investigated on cereals (wheat) and on fruit crops (grape and banana). For monitoring, the residue in plant was defined as the parent spiroxamine. For risk assessment, two separate residue definitions were proposed for cereals and for fruit crops. However for fruits, this definition has to be considered provisional, pending additional information on the toxicity of the group B and C metabolites. In animal, the residue was defined as metabolite M06 for monitoring and two separate definitions were proposed for risk assessment, for ruminant and poultry. There was no consumer risk assessment possible for grapes. For cereals, no acute or chronic concern was identified, the TMDI and IESTI being below the ADI and the ARfD values. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are essentially sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses, with the notable exceptions that the potential for groundwater contamination by metabolite M03 (KWG 4168-N-oxide) is not finalised. Another data gap was also identified to address potential preferential enantioselective degradation in the aquatic environment. The acute and short-term risk for birds was assessed as low for the representative uses. After the necessary refinement the long-term risk for birds was considered low. The acute and long-term risk for mammals was assessed as low after the adequate refinement for the representative uses. High risk was identified for aquatic organisms even with risk mitigation measures. The risk for non-target arthropods in the off-field area in grapes use was assessed as low. However, a high risk was initially identified in the in-field area. Taking into account all available information (extended and field studies) the PRAPeR 75 meeting concluded that the risk for the in-field areas can be assessed as low for the use in grapes. The risk to nin target arthropos in the in-field and off-field area from the use in cereals was assessed as low. The risk for bees, earthworms and other non-target soil-macro-organisms, soil micro-organism and biological methods for sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bispyribac (unless otherwise stated all data evaluated refer to the variant bispyribac-sodium),2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1692,"Bispyribac-sodium is a new active substance for which in accordance with Article 6(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC3 Italy received an application from Bayer CropScience AG for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Complying with Article 6 of Directive 91/414/EEC, the completeness of the dossier was evaluated and confirmed by Commission Decision 2003/305/EC4. Following the agreement between the EU-Commission and the EFSA for the EFSA to organise a peer review of those new active substances for which the decision on the completeness of the dossier had been published after June 2002, the designated rapporteur Member State Italy made the report of its initial evaluation of the dossier on bispyribac-sodium, hereafter referred to as the draft assessment report (DAR), available on 1 August 2003. The peer review was initiated on 14 October 2003 by dispatching the DAR (Italy, 2003) for consultation of the Member States and the applicant. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting in September 2004. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June-July 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place in a written procedure with the Member States in February/March 2009 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a herbicide on rice. Full details of the GAP can be found in the list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Nominee 400 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC). In the formulation the active substance is present as the sodium salt. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for plants, soil, ground water and air. With the inclusion of M01 and M02 and their salts in the residue definition for surface water some new data requirements have been identified. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. With regard to its toxicological properties, bispyribac-sodium is almost completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, does not bioaccumulate in the organism and is mainly excreted as bispyribacsodium. It is of low acute toxicity and presents skin sensitisation properties. The proposed classification is Xi, R43 "" May cause sensitisation by skin contact"". In repeated dose studies, the main target organ was the liver in all species, and the red blood cells in rats. No genotoxic potential was shown in vitro or in vivo, and no evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in long term studies. In the reproductive toxicity studies, the fertility parameters and the embryo-foetal development were not affected. Mechanistic studies have confirmed that bispyribac-sodium has an effect on the excretory biliary system at the high dose. Several metabolites were also tested and shown to be of low acute oral toxicity and without mutagenic properties. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day based on the 2-generation and 2-year rat studies. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.072 mg/kg bw/day based on the subchronic rat study. An Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered necessary due to the lack of effects after acute exposure. In the absence of experimental data, the default value of 100% was agreed for the dermal absorption. The operator exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment. The metabolism studies with bispyribac-sodium in dry-seeded and water-seeded rice demonstrated that the metabolic pathway was similar under the two cultivation conditions investigated. Bispyribacsodium was incorporated to a large extent into plant components. Of the extractable residues, unchanged parent bispyribac-sodium was always the largest component and was thus defined as the relevant residue for risk assessment and MRL setting purposes. Metabolism studies and residue trials results indicate that under practical conditions, residues of bispyribac-sodium are not expected to exceed the LOQ of 0.02 mg/kg in rice grain. In a confined rotational crop study total residues in the rotated wheat, radish, soybean did not exceed 0.01 mg/kg and thus no significant residues are expected in crops planted in soil previously treated with bispyribac-sodium. No significant residues occur in commodities to be processed or used in livestock diet, and therefore no further investigation in processing studies and livestock studies was required to support the representative use in rice. In a chronic consumer exposure risk assessment it could be demonstrated that the maximum estimated dietary intake of residues of bispyribac-sodium is well below (< 1%) the toxicological reference value ADI. As no ARfD was allocated an acute risk assessment is not necessary. The route and rate of degradation of bispyribac-sodium in drained and flooded paddy rice soils was investigated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 20. C. Bispyribac-sodium was low to moderately persistent in aerobic drained paddy soils and moderately persistent in aerobic flooded paddy soils. It degraded to form the major metabolite M06 (DesMe-2023) that was further degraded to M05 (Na-BX-180; major metabolite only under drained conditions). Metabolite M06 (DesMe-2023) was low to moderately persistent and metabolite M05 (Na-BX-180) was moderately persistent in aerobic paddy soils both under drained or flooded conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, bispyribacsodium is moderately to highly persistent in anaerobic flooded paddy soils. Metabolite M06 (DesMe2023) and an additional metabolite M04 (MeBA) were identified as major metabolites under anaerobic conditions. During the peer review some concerns were expressed regarding the lack of information in the DAR on the multi-compartmental model assumed on the fitting of data to calculate kinetic parameters for metabolites. The RMS has made available to EFSA a new addendum in March 2008 (dated July 2007). No soil photolysis study is available based on the use in paddy rice just before flooding. Dissipation of bispyribac-sodium in soil was also investigated in four rice field sites replicating the proposed intended use. Bispyribac-sodium was low persistent in these field trials (DissT50 = 2.1-9.1 d). Metabolites M03 (Me2BA: max. < 1. g /kg soil; < 13.9 %), M05 (NaBX-180: max. 1.88. g /Kg soil; 21.8 % parent equivalents). M06 (DesMe-2023: max. 5.44. g /Kg; 45.3 % parent equivalents) and M10 (Na-DesMe-180: max. 0.3. g /L < 7.74 % parent equivalents) were found in these trials. PEC soil of bispyribac-sodium and its major soil metabolites M06 (DesMe-2023) and M05 (Na-BX180) were calculated with MED-Rice tools (European Commission, 2003). According to the available studies, bispyribac-sodium and metabolite M05 (Na-BX-180) are expected to exhibit medium mobility in soil whereas metabolite M06 (DesMe-2023) may be considered highly mobile. Bispyribac-sodium is slowly hydrolysed at pH 5 and may be considered stable at pH 7 and 9. Bispyribac-sodium was found to be stable to direct aqueous photolysis. Bispyribac-sodium is considered not to be readily biodegradable. In water sediment systems, bispyribac-sodium was converted to a number of metabolites through demethylation and breakage of ether bridges (DT50 whole system = 10.7-59.9 d). The only major metabolite found in the water phase of one of the systems was M06 (DesMe-2023). In the sediment layer M10 (Na-DesMe-180) occurred as a major metabolite in one of the systems. The MED-Rice scheme was used to calculate PECSW and PECSED for bispyribac-sodium and its metabolites. The aerobic flooded soil study and the aerobic water sediment study were used to calculate geometric mean DissT50 water (16.2 d) and geometric mean DT50 whole system (22.1 d) used in the calculations. The application rate was reduced assuming a DT50 = 8.7 d for the drained soil period. PECSW and PECSED for metabolites were calculated according to the MED-Rice scheme. DT50 from the whole aerobic flooded soil experiments were used for M05 (Na-BX-180; DissT50 = 25.9 d) and M06 (DesMe-2023; DissT(50) = 28.3 d) were used to represent dissipation in both the sediment and the water phase. Maximum amounts of M05 (Na-BX-180; 21.8 % AR) and M06 (DesMe-2023; max. 45.3 % AR) observed in the field dissipation study were used to simulate a pseudo application of the metabolite. Potential ground water contamination by bispyribac-sodium and its soil metabolites was assessed by calculating PEC GW with the MED-Rice scheme. Predicted environmental concentrations for the two rice scenarios were calculated to be < 0.001. g /L for bispyribac-sodium and metabolite M05 (Na-BX-180) and 0.08. g /L for M06 (DesMe-2023) in the sandy scenario. However, the presumed minor non transient metabolites M04 and M10 and major metabolite M03 in field studies need to be addressed for potential ground water contamination. Due to the low potential of volatilization and the estimated rapid photochemical transformation, the environmental concentrations in air and the transport through air are considered negligible for bispyribac-sodium. The first-tier TER values for insectivorous and herbivorous birds and mammals were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. The risk from contaminated drinking water was considered low both for birds and mammals. Secondary poisoning was considered to be of no concern, given the hydrophilic properties of bispyribac-sodium. Bispyribac-sodium is very toxic to aquatic organisms and should be classified as R50. Annex VI trigger values were met for all aquatic organisms in an ""off-crop"" risk assessment for both the active substance and all the metabolites, based on PECpw values derived in accordance with the MED-Rice guidance document. Following the MED-Rice guidance document the ""in-crop"" aquatic risk assessment focused on aquatic animals. Annex VI triggers were met for bispyribac-sodium and all metabolites, indicating a low risk to aquatic animals "" in-field"". Bioconcentration was not considered an issue as bispyribac-sodium is hydrophilic. The risk to bees and not-target arthropods and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low. Additionally the risk to soil dwelling organisms, i. e. earthworms, Folsomia and micro-organisms was assessed as low, both for the active substance and the major soil metabolites MO6 (DesMe-2023) and MO5 (Na-Bx-180). The tier 1 risk assessment to non-target plants indicated a need for risk mitigation, e. g. no-spray buffer zones of 30 m.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance myclobutanil,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/jefsa.2010.1682,"Myclobutanil is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002.3 This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on myclobutanil in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 29 March 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Dow AgroSciences. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in October -November 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 14 November 2007 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA conclusion finalised on 4 June 2009 (EFSA scientific Report 2009 (298)). Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 4 concerning the noninclusion of myclobutanil in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Dow AgroScience made a resubmission application for the inclusion of myclobutanil in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20085. The resubmission dossier included further data in all section. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted an evaluation of the additional data on myclobutanil in the format of an Additional Report (Belgium, 2009). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 22 October 2009. In accordance with Article 19, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to the Member States and the applicant for comments on 26 October 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 December 2009. At the same time the collated comments were forwarded to the rapporteur Member State for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested thze EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of ecotoxicology abd deliver it's conclusion on myclobutanil. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis ogf the evaluation of the representative use of myclobutanil on apples and grapes. However the apple use was not supported in the resubmission, Terefore, t he conclusion of the peer review following the resubmission application was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as fungicide as proposed by the applicant which comprises air assisted broadcast spraying to table and wine grapes, against powdery mildew and black rot, in Northern and Southern Europe, up to a maximum 4 applications at a maximum individual application rate per spray of 48 g a. s./ha, with an interval of 10 days between applications. It should be noted that in the resubmission dossier the use in apples against powdery mildew and scab is no longer supported. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ` Systhane 20 EW', an emulsion, oil in water (EW) containing 200 g/l myclobutanil. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definitions for monitoring. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method. In mammals, myclobutanil LD50 is 1600 mg/kg bw (classification as R22 ""Harmful if swallowed""is proposed). It is not toxic via dermal and inhalation routes (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg bw and LC50> 5.1 mg/L). Myclobutanil is not a skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. The European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) classified myclobutanil with R36 (""Irritating to eyes""). The primary target organ following exposure to myclobutanil is the liver. Myclobutanil induces liver enlargement accompanied by slight induction of biotransformation enzymes (in rats and mice). An overall subchronic NOAEL of 100 ppm was proposed (3.09 mg/kg bw/day). Myclobutanil does not show any genotoxic potential. In long-term studies in rat, the target organ appeared to be the testes (bilateral testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis). The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day from the rat study. Myclobutanil did not show any carcinogenic potential. In a two-generation rat study, myclobutanil, at a dietary concentration of 1000 ppm (80 mg/kg bw/day) produced reduced parental body weight and liver effects and decreased weight gain in pups during lactation; at slight parental toxic doses the number of females delivering litters was reduced and the incidence of still-born pups increased. The relevant parental, offspring and reproductive NOAEL is 16 mg/kg bw/day. Myclobutanil is already classified as Repr. Cat 3, R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child""). The relevant parental NOAEL is 94 mg/kg bw/day, while the relevant developmental NOAEL is 31 mg/kg bw/day. No indication of any other neurological effects was found in the toxicological studies. The proposed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is based on the relevant NOAEL from the long-term rat study, applying a safety factor of 100, giving an ADI of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. The Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) of 0.03 mg/kg bw/day was agreed to be based on the overall NOAEL (90-day and 1-year in dog) of 3.09 mg/kg bw/day, with a safety factor of 100. The rat developmental toxicity study was considered as the most appropriate to use for setting the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD). An NOAEL of 31.3 mg/kg bw/day was established due to embryotoxic effects (altered viability index). Based on this NOAEL and an assessment factor of 100 the proposed ARfD is 0.31 mg/kg bw. There is a 300-fold margin between the proposed ARfD and the LOAEL for developmental effects in the rat developmental toxicity study. The operator and worker exposure estimates showed levels below the AOEL even when no PPE is worn (German model). The bystander exposure estimates were below the AOEL. The metabolism of myclobutanil was investigated in grapes (representative use), apples and additionally in wheat. In grapes and apples at harvest, the major components of the residue were myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 in free and conjugated form. A metabolic cleavage of the myclobutanil molecule which would generate triazole derivative metabolites was-in contrast to the wheat study-not observed in apples and grapes at the investigated pre-harvest intervals. Based on the available plant metabolism data for the categories fruit and cereals it was concluded that the metabolism is not comparable amongst different crop groups. As for the representative use, however, it was agreed that the relevant residue for the category fruit crops should be defined as myclobutanil and its metabolite RH-9090 (free and conjugated). A sufficient number of residue trials in grapes are available; however, there is still evidence required that the submitted trials fully cover the proposed residue definition and conjugates were determined with an acceptable yield. In processing studies it was investigated how the residue levels of myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 change when grapes are processed to juice, wine, etc. It was further demonstrated in a hydrolysis study that both myclobutanil and metabolite RH-9090 are likely to remain stable under processing conditions. The investigation of residues in rotational and succeeding crops was considered not relevant since both apples and grapes are perennial crops that are usually not grown in rotation with other crops. However it was highlighted that upon repeated application and in the long term the issue of potential uptake of myclobutabil residues and/ or triazole derivative metabolites could become relevant. The issue of triazole derivative metabolites might have to be followed up separately as this concern is not specific to the active substance myclobutanil alone but common to a number of triazole pesticides. Moreover, the risk assessment with regard to the two isomers of myclobutanil was not addressed. As a consequence of the identified data gaps, the consumer risk assessment for the representative use on grapes was not fully finalised. It is also noted that the consumer could be exposed to residues of myclobutanil butyric acid, 6 which may occur in groundwater above 0.75 mu g/L (up to 0.81675 mu g/L) for which the mammalian toxicology assessment indicates the ADI for parent myclobutanil could be used. Therefore, in addition to exposure from residues in food an exposure of consumers can be expected when ground water is used as drinking water though this route of exposure is not considered significant (< 1% ADI and ARfD). In soil under aerobic conditions myclobutanil exhibits high to very high persistence, forming the minor soil metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid (accounting for a maximum of 6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the chlorophenyl and triazole rings to carbon dioxide was limited and accounted for only 0.2 to 1.7% AR after 120 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink, accounting for 4 to 16% AR after 120 days. Myclobutanil exhibits medium to low mobility in soil, myclobutanil butyric acid exhibits very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either myclobutanil or myclobutanil butyric acid was affected significantly by differing soil pH. Data on degradation in soil under anaerobic conditions are not available and it was considered they will be necessary to support the applied for use on apples in some territories of the EU. In dark natural sediment water systems myclobutanil partitioned from the water column to sediment where it exhibited very high persistence. The terminal metabolite, CO2, accounted for a maximum of 0.3% AR at 105 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues were a sink but represented only 4.3 to 9.8% AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for myclobutanil at steps 3 and 4, with spray drift mitigation being applied at step 4. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. On the basis of the available information, it can be concluded that for the representative use assessed on grapes, groundwater exposure by myclobutanil above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, will not occur in geoclimatic situations represented by 6 out of the 7 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. In geoclimatic situations represented by just the Piacenza scenario, groundwater exposure might occur with concentrations (annual average recharge leaving the top 1m soil layer) estimated to be 0.21 mu g/L. For the metabolite myclobutanil butyric acid, groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water is expected in geoclimatic situations represented all 7 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. In geoclimatic situations represented the FOCUS Hamburg vine groundwater scenario concentrations > 0.75 mu g/L (a key assessment trigger from the groundwater metabolite relevance guidance document) might be expected. A groundwater metabolite non-relevance assessment was therefore necessary for myclobutanil butyric acid. An assessment following the relevant guidance was available that demonstrated non-relevance. The risk to birds, mammals, aquatic organisms, bees, non-target arthropods, earthworms, other soil non-target macro-organisms, soil non-target micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the respresentative use in grapes. It was identified that the risk assessment did not address the potential for different myclobutanil isomer ratios to be present in the environment.",NA

The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of 6-benzladenine as a plant growth regulator on maize and apples as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. No critical areas of concern were identified in the area of physical-chemical properties. One data gap for a plant method was identified. No critical areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the area of mammalian toxicology. The risk assessment is finalised. There were no critical areas of concern in the residues section, however a data gap was identified for quantitative evidence of the natural occurrence of 6-benzyladenine in edible crops, and the consumer risk assessment could not be finalised. In soil, 6-benzyladenine exhibits very low persistence and did not show any metabolite needing further consideration. 6-benzyladenine is stable to hydrolysis; however, in water/sediment systems it is degraded relatively rapidly. According to the FOCUS GW models available (using worst case input parameters), it is not expected that 6-benzyladenine will contaminate groundwater above the limit of 0.1 mu g/L when used according to the representative uses proposed (FOCUS 2000, 2007). No critical areas of concern were identified in the area of ecotoxicology; however a data gap was identified to address the effects of the formulation to aquatic plants and to the most sensitive algae species, for which the risk assessment could not be finalised.",NA

The consumer risk assessment is not finalised. There is uncertainty over whether the presence of remainders of polysulfides on the crop surface can definitely be excluded, and whether this may become an issue for consumer safety. Concerning the environmental fate and behaviour of lime sulfur, data gaps were identified to address the impact of calcium concentrations in soil and hydrogen sulfide levels in sediment arising from the use of lime sulfur with respect to the natural background concentration levels of calcium in EU agricultural soils and hydrogen sulfide levels in the sediment of natural surface water systems. The risk assessment for sediment-dwelling organisms and non-target arthropods is not finalised and two data gaps were identified.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbetamide,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1913,"Carbetamide is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of carbetamide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 05 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of carbetamide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Feinchemie Schwebda GmbH made a resubmission application for the inclusion of carbetamide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 12 February 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 16 February 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 02 April 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on carbetamide. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of carbetamide as a herbicide on winter oilseed rape as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. No critical areas of concern were identified in the area of physical-chemical properties. Two data gaps were identified for spectra and a specific chiral method for the active substance in the formulation. No critical areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the area of mammalian toxicology. Based on the metabolism study conducted on rapeseed, the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as carbetamide (sum R/S isomers). Additional information is required in order to address the residues in following crops in the case of crop failure. No critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. The consumer risk assessment was finalised and no chronic or acute concern was identified. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative use assessed. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative use by carbetamide and the groundwater relevant metabolite (RS) carbetamide-COOH above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by 5 out of the 6 pertinent FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Under the vulnerable conditions represented by just the Piacenza FOCUS groundwater scenario, groundwater exposure at concentrations above 0.1 mu g/L cannot be excluded. For the typical situation where oilseed rape is grown in rotation with other crops, the 80th percentile annual average recharge concentrations leaving the top 1m soil layer were predicted to be up to 0.215 mu g carbetamide/L and 0.260 mu g (RS) carbetamide-COOH/L at the Piacenza scenario(7). No critical areas of concern were identified for the environmental risk assessment. Risk mitigation measures equivalent to a 5m no-spray buffer zone are required to identify a low risk for non-target plants following the representative use of carbetamide. Application of run-off mitigation measures (e.g. 10m buffer strips) would be required to identify a low risk to aquatic organisms in agricultural landscapes similar to the R3 stream scenario. It was recommended to not apply carbetamide on drained soils in agricultural landscapes comparable to the FOCUS D2 scenarion, as a low risk was not identifyed for the representative use. Based on the recommended mitigation measure the risk to nontarget organisms was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance,2010,EFSA JOURNAL,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1869,"Flurochloridone is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 1 le, to withdraw support for the inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex Ito Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)5 concerning the non inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Makhteshim made a resubmission application for the inclusion of flurochloridone in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by EFSA on 03 November 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 November 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 05 January 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of toxicology and deliver its conclusions on flurochloridone. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of flurochloridone as a herbicide on sunflower and potato as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. No critical areas of concern were indentified in the physical chemical properties section, however several data gaps were identified for the active substance and formulation (see section 1). A data gap was identified in the toxicology section to address the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification. No toxicological information is available on the metabolite R42819 that may be found in groundwater at levels above the threshold value of 0.1 mu g/L according to environmental models; based on the classification proposal as R61 (Repr. Cat. 2, ""May cause harm to the unborn child"") and R62 (Repr. Cat. 3, ""Possible risk of impaired fertility"") for the parent, this metabolite is relevant according to the Guidance document on assessment of the relevance of metabolites in groundwater (European Commission, 2003) and a critical area of concern was identified. Based on the metabolism studies conducted on sunflower and potato (oilseeds/pulses group and tubers/roots group), the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as flurochloridone (sum of cis and trans isomers). MRLs were proposed at the LOQ (0.01 mg/kg). No risk was identified for the consumers, the TMDI and IESTI being less than 0.1% of the ADI and less than 4% of the ARfD. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses. A high potential for groundwater contamination by metabolite R42819 in a wide range of geoclimatic conditions above the parametric drinking water limit (0.1 mu g/L) is indicated by the exposure assessment that could be finalised with the available data. (All the FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for sunflower and 7 of the 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios pertinent for potato have annual average groundwater recharge concentrations predicted to be >0.1 mu g/L). Two data gaps were identified in the environmental risk assessment to address the potential risk to birds and fish from flurochloridone acting as endocrine disruptor and to address the risk to algae for the representative uses. The risk to non -target plants was assessed as low for the representative uses, based on mitigation measures equivalent to no-spray buffer zones of 5 m.",NA

No data gaps or areas of concern were identified in the area of mammalian toxicology. The consumer risk assessment for the representative use of fenoxycarb in apples and pears has been addressed by the available data and no areas of concern were identified. The data available in the area of environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative uses. A high risk was identified for aquatic organisms based on higher tier level assessment for all the representative uses which was considered a critical area of concern. A data gap was identified for to further address the risk to aquatic invertebrates taking into account the mode of action of fenoxycarb and the most sensitive growth stages. A data gap was identified to further address the effects on bee brood and mitigation measures to protect bees (i.e. SPe8) were recommended. A high risk was identified for the in-crop and off-crop risk to non-target arthropods and a data gap was set for all the representative uses. A critical area of concern was identified. A low risk was assessed for birds and mammals, soil non-target macro and micro-organisms, terrestrial non-target plants and biological methods for sewage treatments.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance terbuthylazine European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1969,"Terbuthylazine is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicants' decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of terbuthylazine in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of terbuthylazine in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants Syngenta Crop Protection AG and Oxon Italia SpA made a resubmission application for the inclusion of terbuthylazine in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 3 February 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 4 February 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 22 March 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour, and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on terbuthylazine. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of terbuthylazine as a herbicide in maize and sorghum, as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Two data gaps were identified in the section identity. Data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section to address the relevance of the impurities present in the technical specification for both the Syngenta and Oxon sources. As the batches used in the toxicological studies do not support the technical specification from either the Syngenta or the Oxon source, a critical area of concern was identified. An assessment of the equivalence of the formulation used to perform the acute toxicity studies and the representative formulation 'Gardo (R) Gold (R)' was not presented. As classification with R40 ( carcinogen category 3) is proposed for terbuthylazine, the groundwater metabolites (MT1, MT13, MT14, LM1, LM2, LM3, LM4, LM5, LM6) are considered toxicologically relevant. Based on the metabolism study conducted on maize and on rotational crops, the plant residue definition was defined as terbuthylazine for monitoring, and as the sum of terbuthylazine and metabolites MT1 and MT14 for risk assessment. No data gaps were identified in the residue section. Concerning the environmental fate and behaviour of terbuthylazine, the groundwater exposure assessment is not finalised for the toxicologically relevant metabolites LM1, LM2, LM3, LM4, LM5 and LM6. However, based on the results from lysimeter studies and groundwater monitoring data, metabolites LM3, LM5 and LM6 may be expected to occur above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L over a wide range of geo-climatic conditions. The potential for groundwater exposure by the relevant herbicidally active metabolite desethyl-terbuthylazine, the toxicologically relevant metabolites desethyl-hydroxy-terbuthylazine and hydroxy-terbuthylazine above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is predicted to be high over a wide range of the geo-climatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The number of FOCUS scenarios exceeding the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was 6 for desethyl-terbuthylazine, 8 for desethyl-hydroxy-terbuthylazine and 8 for hydroxy-terbuthylazine. Additional information on the groundwater leaching potential of these metabolites was available in lysimeter and groundwater monitoring studies and experts agreed that this further information should also be taken into account when considering the overall leaching behaviour of these metabolites. Considering all the available data critical areas of concern are identified with respect to the potential for groundwater contamination by desethyl-terbuthylazine, desethyl-hydroxy-terbuthylazine and hydroxy-terbuthylazine. A high long-term risk and a high risk from secondary poisoning of mammals were identified in the risk assessment. A high long-term risk to birds was indicated for the higher application rate (1 x 0.844 kg a.s./ha). A high risk was also indicted to aquatic organisms and non-target plants. Risk mitigation comparable to a no-spray buffer zone of 10 m plus 90% run-off reduction would be needed to achieve TERs above the trigger in the majority of FOCUS scenarios. A high long-term risk was indicated for earthworms from the representative use of GARDO (R) GOLD (R) (Syngenta). Risk mitigation comparable to in-field no-spray buffer zones of 5 and 20 m are needed to protect non-target plants in the off-field area.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance difenoconazole European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1967,"Difenoconazole is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002,(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(4) Difenoconazole was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 January 2009 pursuant to Article 11b of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 (hereinafter referred to as, the Regulation.). In accordance with Article 12a of the Regulation the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2010 its view on the draft review report submitted by the Commission of the European Communities (hereinafter referred to as, the Commission.) in accordance with Article 12(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on difenoconazole in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 22 December 2006. The peer review was initiated on 6 March 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the notifier Syngenta Ltd. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on difenoconazole. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of difenoconazole as a fungicide on pome fruit, carrot, wheat, barley, triticale, rye and oats as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. No critical areas of concern were identified in the physical-chemical properties section. However, data gaps were identified for data to support the ranges of the cis/trans isomers in the technical specification, the biological activity of the isomers, the validation of the isomer method, the consequence for the physical-chemical properties of the active substance of the wide range of isomer content and the formulation's adhesion to seeds. No critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. Two data gaps were identified: for an assessment of the toxicological relevance of some impurities; and to clarify the uncertainties related to the isomer ratio of the tested compound (for which reference values have been derived), the isomer ratio to which the workers will be exposed and the relative toxicity of the different isomers. Based on the metabolism studies conducted on four plant groups, the residue in plants was defined as difenoconazole for monitoring and provisionally as difenoconazole and TDM for risk assessment. Residue definitions were also proposed for animal products. No critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. Data gaps were identified to provide information on the possible residues of TDM metabolites in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and animal products. Additional residue trials and processing studies on carrots are also required. No acute or chronic intake concerns were identified for consumers, but this evaluation has to be considered provisional, since the contribution of the TDM metabolites and the isomeric composition of the residues were not taken into account. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour were generally sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative uses assessed. The potential for groundwater contamination consequent to these uses by difenoconazole and the metabolites 1,2,4-triazole and CGA 205375 above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was assessed as low. However, data gaps were identified for identification of the metabolites V3 and M4 formed in soil incubation, and for the rate of dissipation of difenoconazole in the field under Southern European conditions. The assessment of the environmental behaviour and consequent exposure levels of individual enantiomers of difenoconazole was not finalised. Data gaps were identified in the ecotoxicology section. Further refinement of the risk to aquatic sediment-dwelling organisms for the use in cereals is necessary. Furthermore, the potential endocrine disruption effects in fish should be addressed. A data gap was also identified to demonstrate that the increase in body weight would not lead to adverse effects on earthworm populations in order to be able to use the reproduction NOEC from the reproduction study. Data gaps were identified to address the chronic risk to earthworms and Collembola. The possible impact on the ecotoxicity and the environment of potential enantio-selective biologically mediated metabolism/degradation or transformation needs to be addressed in order to the risk assessment for non-target organisms.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flurprimidol European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1962,"Flurprimidol is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Finland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on flurprimidol in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 April 2007. The peer review was initiated on 17 September 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant SePRO Europe Limited. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March-April 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in July 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 151). Following the Commission Decision of 13 January 2009 (2009/28/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant SePRO Europe Limited made a resubmission application for the inclusion of flurprimidol in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/173/08)as follows: The risk to operators and workers The exceedence of the AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) for operators and workers in all evaluated scenarios and conditions of use; The lack of information on impurities present in the batches used in the toxicological studies. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Finland, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 March 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation ( EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 11 March 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on flurprimidol. The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Topflor', a micro-emulsion ( ME) containing 3.8 g/l flurprimidol. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection products are possible. There are no adequate methods available to monitor flurprimidol in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues. In mammalian metabolism studies, flurprimidol was rapidly but not completely absorbed after oral administration. It was extensively metabolised and distributed through the body. Excretion was rapid, mainly via urine although some excretion was observed via bile and faeces. Moderate acute oral toxicity was found in rat and mouse, requiring classification with Xn, R22 ""harmful if swallowed"", but no classification was needed related to acute dermal or inhalation toxicity. Flurprimidol was not a skin or eye irritant and no sensitisation potential was found. Main effects observed in short-term and long-term toxicity studies were liver toxicity including enzyme induction and histopathological findings, and uterine and ovary weight changes down to the lowest dose tested, indicative of endocrine disruption effects at low doses. Genotoxicity studies covering all required endpoints (in vitro bacterial and mammalian gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus test) were negative and no carcinogenic potential was observed in either rats or mice upon 2-year oral exposure. Flurprimidol was thought to inhibit aromatase activity because the observed effects were similar to those observed with structurally related active substance fenarimol. However, no mechanistic study was performed with flurprimidol and sensitive end points for aromatase inhibition were not measured in studies conducted with flurprimidol. Reproductive toxicity was indicated by increased precoital period, dystocia, progeny mortality, reduced mating performance and fertility which were not considered secondary to parental systemic toxicity. Accordingly, classification as toxic, reproduction toxicity category 2 for fertility, R60 ""may impair fertility"", was proposed. In the rat developmental toxicity study, the proportion of foetuses with developmental variations and abnormalities was increased and could not be explained by maternal toxicity alone. Accordingly classification as harmful, reproduction toxicity category 3 for development, R63 ""possible risk of harm to the unborn child"" was proposed. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day, the Acceptable Operator Exposure ( AOEL) was 0.003 mg/kg bw/day and the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was 0.09 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption was 6 % for the concentrate formulation and 15 % for the in-use spray dilution based on an in vitro study performed on human skin. The estimated level of operator exposure calculated for glasshouses' uses on ornamentals with the representative formulation 'Topflor' according to the EUROPOEM II and the Dutch model is below the AOEL when the use of personal protective equipment (PPE, i.e. gloves and protective clothing) is considered. Estimated exposure of workers is below the AOEL after one application of 'Topflor' when the use of gloves and coverall is considered. After 2 applications (assuming that there is no decay in the residues during the 14-days interval between applications), estimated worker exposure exceeds the AOEL (103 %) even when PPE are worn and a critical area of concern was identified. Furthermore, flurprimidol is a racemate and there is no information on the relative toxicity of each isomer or whether there is a shift in the isomer ratio workers are exposed to. A data gap is identified to address this. Bystander's exposure is not relevant for the representative use. No data were submitted to study and assess the residue behaviour of flurprimidol in plants and livestock in order to define the relevant residues for dietary consumer risk assessment. The representative use of flurprimidol in containerised ornamentals, pot and bedding plants are normally not expected to result in any dietary exposure to consumers or livestock. Potted herbs or any other edible container plants are not meant to be included in the representative use. A potential transfer of residues from recycled soil and/or compost to crops intended for human or animal consumption should be avoided, by taking appropriate restriction measures. Under conditions excluding any potential consumer exposure to flurprimidol residues through food, there will be no dietary consumer risk related to the representative use. All available fate and behaviour into the environment studies have been performed with flurprimidol labelled exclusively at the phenyl ring and / or at the carbinol bridge. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for a full fate and behaviour data package of studies performed with flurprimidol labelled at the pyrimidine ring. The data available for fate and behaviour of flurprimidol into the environment are very limited. Information on the fate of the individual enantiomers is not available. Data on the route of degradation in soil are insufficient to assess any use for which exposure could not be completely excluded. The data available show that flurprimidol exhibits medium to high persistence in soil (DT50 = 98 - 183 d) under laboratory aerobic conditions ( no field study available) and that it is not hydrolysed in buffered water in the range of environmental pHs. Photolysis of flurprimidol in water was relatively rapid ( DT50 = 1.4 d) and results in the formation of two photolysis metabolites that would need to be further assessed for the aquatic environment in the situation that exposure could not be completely excluded from the representative use. No water sediment study is available in the dossier. Potential groundwater contamination was precluded from the representative use if it is restricted as proposed by the meeting of experts. In general a number of data gaps for fate and behaviour into the environment were identified during the peer review, however, they were considered not to be essential for the assessment of the representative use if this can be effectively restricted / managed in order to avoid exposure to the environment, including the potential exposure arising from disposal of used soil and residues of plants. Note the PPR panel of EFSA, has questioned the effectiveness of risk management measures such as those proposed here, to limit environmental exposure from uses in glasshouses. The environmental risk assessment covers only the use in glasshouses that are permanent structures. No risk assessment was conducted for birds and mammals. Direct exposure of birds and mammals is expected to be negligible for the representative use in glasshouses. The log P-ow of flurprimidol is >3 and therefore a risk assessment should be conducted for secondary poisoning of earthworm-and fish-eating birds and mammals if treated substrate and plants are disposed of in the environment. The risk to fish, aquatic invertebrates and algae was assessed as low. A study with higher aquatic plants is needed since flurprimidol is a plant growth regulator. However, the study is not required to finalise the EU risk assessment for the representative use if the use is restricted to high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems. Effects of >50% on mortality and reproduction were observed in sensitive groups of non-target arthropods at concentrations below the suggested application rate of 60 g a.s./ha. Arthropods used in glasshouses for biological plant protection purpose are likely to be severely impacted by the use of flurprimidol. The risk to non-target arthropods in the environment surrounding the glasshouse was considered to be low due to negligible exposure. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. No study was submitted to investigate long-term (reproductive) effects on earthworms. Such a study was considered not necessary provided that treated soil and plants are not disposed of in the environment. No risk assessment was conducted for other soil non-target organisms and non-target micro-organisms. However, the risk to soil dwelling organisms is assumed to be low for the use in high technology glasshouse production systems with irrigation/excess water management systems and provided that treated substrate and plants are not disposed of in the environment. The risk to non-target plants in the vicinity of glasshouses was considered to be low. The risk to bees and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triflumuron,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1941,"Triflumuron is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/ 2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Italy being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triflumuron in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 July 2005. The peer review was initiated on 28 February 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 194). Following the Commission Decision of 16 March 2009 (2009/241/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triflumuron in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/146/08) as follows: The risk to consumers The risk to aquatic organisms. The acute toxicity of metabolite M07. The lack of data to determine an appropriate residue definition. The lack of data on the levels of residues in processed commodities. The high risk to the aquatic environment In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 5 March 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 March 2010 and 11 March 2010 respectively. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 26 April 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on triflumuron. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide on apples, pears, peaches and nectarines. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Alsystin SC 480"", a suspension concentrate (SC), containing 480 g/l triflumuron. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Data for the relevant impurity 4-trifluoro-methoxyaniline are missing. With regard to its toxicological properties, triflumuron is extensively absorbed after oral administration and has a low acute toxicity. The main adverse effect after repeated administration is haemolytic anaemia with compensative responses and secondary effects in different organs. No mutagenic or carcinogenic potential has been demonstrated in the available tests. In the reproductive toxicity testing, no specific effects on the fertility parameters, on the growth of the offspring or on the foetal development were observed in the absence of maternal toxicity. It was agreed that triflumuron has no specific neurotoxic potential. Several tests were performed on metabolites and/or impurities. The plant metabolites M01, M02, M07 and M08 were considered as covered by the toxicological studies with the parent (use of the same acceptable daily intake). Since it was shown to be acutely more toxic than triflumuron, new toxicological data were provided for the plant metabolite M07 during the resubmission, allowing the derivation of a specific acute reference dose. The agreed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for triflumuron is 0.014 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study supported by the 2-year rat study and with the use of a safety factor of 100. The agreed Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) is 0.036 mg/kg bw/day, based on the overall NOAEL of the 90-day rat studies and applying a safety factor of 100. The derivation of an Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) was not considered needed for triflumuron. The agreed dermal absorption values resulting from in vivo and in vitro testing are 1% for the concentrate (mixing/loading) and 5% for the dilution (application). The estimated operator exposure levels according to the models are below the AOEL without the use of personal protective equipment, and the estimated exposure values for the workers and bystanders are even lower. The plant metabolism of triflumuron was investigated in apple, tomato, potato and soya bean. Triflumuron was seen to be the major component of the residues in all plant groups investigated. Therefore, the residue definition for monitoring was proposed as triflumuron alone. For the fruit crop group, since no metabolite was detected in significant levels in the metabolism studies conducted on apple and tomato, triflumuron alone was also proposed to define the residue for risk assessment. For the oilseed and root crop groups, metabolites M07 and M08 were, in addition to the parent, included in the definition for risk assessment. Sufficient supervised residue trials were submitted to derive MRL on pome fruit, peaches and nectarines. Processing factors were calculated for processed fruit commodities, and additional studies on apples and peaches confirmed that metabolites M07 and M08 are not expected to be present above the LOQ in processed fractions. However a data gap was identified for peaches, asking for supplementary information on the initial residue levels in the raw products, prior processing. It was concluded that, based on the representative uses, no MRLs are necessary for products of animal origin. No chronic risk was identified for the consumers, the highest TMDI being 46% of the ADI. The acute risk was not considered since no ARfD was allocated to triflumuron. Triflumuron is low to moderate persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions. Two major metabolites are formed: 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea. The trifluoromethoxyphenyl ring was less mineralized and more prone to form unextractable residues than the chlorophenyl ring. From the data available it was not possible to derive reliable half-lives either for parent or for major soil metabolites under anaerobic conditions. Metabolites M02 (max 46.7 % AR) and M08 (max. 48.5 % AR) were the only major metabolites identified under dark anaerobic conditions. According the study available, triflumuron may be considered stable to photolysis in soil. PECs soil have been updated in the Additional Report. According to the available adsorption / desorption studies triflumuron may be considered immobile to low mobile in soil (Koc = 1629 - 30006 mL/g), metabolite M08 may be considered medium to high mobile in soil (Koc = 113 - 280 mL/g) and M02 may be considered very high mobile in soil (Koc = 4.0 - 8.8 mL/g). Triflumuron was stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7 and degrades with a half-life between 29 and 57 d at pH 9. Main hydrolysis metabolites at this pH were M02 (max. 28.9 % AR after 30 d) and M08 (max. 48.8 % AR after 30 d). According to the available study, aqueous photolysis is considered to contribute only in a minor extent to the overall degradation of triflumuron. In the absence of a corresponding study, it is proposed to classify triflumuron as not readily biodegradable. In water sediment systems triflumuron partitioned to the sediment and degraded (DT50 = 4.1 - 7.1 d) to major metabolites M08 (max in water: 47.8 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 20.4 % AR after 7 d; DT50 = 11.4 - 11.7 d) and M02 (max in water: 60.4 % AR after 14 d, max. in sed.: 7.9 % AR after 14 d; DT50 = 17.6 - 62.9 d). Mineralization was more important for the chlorophenyl ring than for the trifluoromethoxyphenyl moiety. The pH of the water phase of the systems investigated was in the alkaline range. A data gap, which was not considered essential to finalize the EU risk assessment, was identified for water / sediment studies within a wider range of pH values. Updated PEC (SW/SED) were presented in the resubmission dossier following the FOCUS SW scheme. New calculations have been presented in the Addendum to the Additional Report. Only the Step 4 calculations taking into account 95% mitigation for spray drift have been retained for the assessment. PEC GW calculations have been updated with FOCUS PELMO 3.3.2 and FOCUS PEARL 3.3.3 to the current GAP and with the new degradation data available. Neither the parent triflumuron nor the two soil metabolites 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl urea are expected to exceed the trigger of 0.1 mu g/L for any of the relevant scenarios. Based on the physical and chemical properties of triflumuron, the volatilization study available and the calculated photochemical half-life for triflumuron, it is expected that it will not be transported over long range distances and will not accumulate in air. The first-tier risk assessment for birds resulted in acute and short-term TERs above the Annex VI trigger of 10 but the long-term TER was below the trigger of 5. The refined long-term risk assessment was based on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) as a focal species. A PT of 0.61 and a RUD of 5.1 ( birds feeding only on large insects) were suggested to refine the risk assessment. The experts rejected the RUD refinement since no data supported the assumption that blue tits would feed only on large insects. The long-term TER was below the trigger of 5 on the basis of the agreed refinement steps and the revised long-term NOEC of 20 ppm. Therefore a data gap was identified in the expert meeting. The refinements suggested by the applicant and evaluated by the RMS in the Additional Report were not accepted and therefore the data gap remains. The acute and long-term trigger values for mammals were exceeded in the first-tier risk assessment indicating a low risk. The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm- and fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low. Triflumuron was very toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic TERs for daphnids were significantly below the Annex VI triggers of 100 and 10 for all FOCUS step 4 scenarios with a no-spray buffer zone of 30 m. A mesocosm study was submitted. The experts agreed on a regulatory endpoint of 0.1 mu g a.s./L in combination with an assessment factor of 3. A no-spray buffer zone of 30 m would not be sufficient to achieve TERs >3. Further refinement of the aquatic risk assessment is needed. New FOCUS step 4 calculations including the maximum spray drift reduction of 95% did not result in a FOCUS scenario where all TERs exceeded the trigger of 3 (applied to a mesocosm NOAEC of 0.1 mu g a.s./L). A high risk to the aquatic environment is indicated. The risk to adult bees was low but bee brood was very sensitive for exposure to triflumuron (insect growth regulator). Exposure of bees was considered to take place via flowering weeds in the orchards. Increased mortality of pupae was observed at an application rate relevant for exposure on weeds. It was further noted that the second application was not covered by the field studies. It was not sufficiently demonstrated that the risk to bee brood development was low and risk mitigation measures such as cutting flowering weeds in the treated field were suggested to protect bees. Chrysoperla carnea was the most sensitive non-target arthropod species tested. This observation was confirmed in a field study in an apple orchard. Full recovery of affected arthropod populations (including the most sensitive species C. carnea) was observed. The study provided some evidence that a sufficiently high number of Chrysoperla larvae could survive in the untreated area to allow recolonisation of the treated in-field area. Overall it was concluded that the risk to non-target arthropods was sufficiently addressed for the representative uses evaluated. The acute risk to earthworms was assessed as low. Since triflumuron inhibits the chitin synthesis the experts considered the potential adverse long-term effects on earthworms necessary to be investigated and therefore a data gap was identified under the first review. For the resubmission, a long-term (reproduction) study with earthworms was submitted and the long-term risk to earthworms was evaluated as low. No studies with other soil non-target macro-organisms were made available for triflumuron under the first review. The experts agreed in the meeting that studies with collembola should be conducted considering the high toxicity to arthropods and that the DT90 can be longer than 100 days under some soil conditions. For the resubmission, new soil degradation studies were made available which indicated that the DT90 is less than 100 days and therefore a study with collembola was not triggered any longer. The risk to soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance 1-naphthylacetic acid,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2019,"1-Naphthylacetic acid is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20043, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as 'the Commission'), the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by France, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicants' decision, in accordance with Article 24e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of 1-naphthylacetic acid in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 8 December 2008 (2008/941/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of 1-naphthylacetic acid in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants Amvac Chemical UK Limited and the 1-NAA Task Force made a resubmission application for the inclusion of 1naphthylacetic acid in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 12 March 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 17 March 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 April 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on 1-naphthylacetic acid. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of 1-naphthylacetic acid as a plant growth regulator on apple as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps were identified in the section on identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods. The technical specification for the Amvac source should be considered provisional at the time of the finalisation of the peer review (January 2011). A data gap was identified in the mammalian toxicology section. The operator, worker and bystander risk assessment could be concluded. Data gaps were identified in the section on residues. Sufficient European residue trials analysed with a validated analytical method and a new freezer storage stability study are required. The consumer risk assessment is not finalised since residue data are not available to address the use pattern that is expected to result in the most critical residue values. No critical area of concern was identified. Data gaps were identified for further information on the route and rate of degradation in soil and for information on photolysis of 1-naphthylacetic acid in soil. The potential for groundwater contamination of 1-naphthylacetic acid above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 ae g/ L was assessed as low for the representative use of 'Amcotone', but high for the representative uses of 'Fruitone N' and 'Obsthormon 24A'. Three data gaps were identified in the ecotoxicology section. A reproduction test is needed to address the long-term risk to birds. The risk to aquatic organisms needs to be addressed for the formulations 'Amcotone' and 'Fruitone N'. The analytical profile of the batches used in the ecotoxicology tests should be provided for the Amvac source. No critical area of concern was identified in the ecotoxicology section.",NA

NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance triazoxide European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2018,"Triazoxide is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on triazoxide in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 25 June 2007. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR to the sole applicant Bayer CropScience AG, and on 5 November 2007 to the Member States for consultation. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May - June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in August 2008 leading to the conclusions as set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 193). Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/860/ EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Bayer CropScience AG made a resubmission application for the inclusion of triazoxide in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/216/08 - rev. 0) as follows: the information available was insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to: the available metabolism and residue data were not considered appropriate to conduct a robust consumer risk assessment due to the uncertainties identified with regard to the nature of residues in plant commodities and the possible transfer of residues in animal products the long-term risk for granivorous bird the long-term risk for granivorous mammals the long-term risk to fish the long-term risk to earthworms and concerns were identified with regard to: the consumer exposure In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the United Kingdom, being the designated RMS in the resubmission procedure, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 10 June 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 16 June 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 30 July 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on triazoxide. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a fungicide as proposed by the applicant, which comprise seed treatment in barley against several agriculturally important diseases. The conclusions of the resubmission were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps were identified in the section on identity and analytical methods. The specification for the technical material should currently be regarded as provisional. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Raxil S FS 040', a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), containing 20 g/L triazoxide and 20 g/L tebuconazole. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition in food/feed of plant origin, soil and water, however for air a method validated to a LOQ of 0.3 mu g a.s./m(3) was identified as a data gap. With regard to its toxicological properties, triazoxide was rapidly and extensively absorbed, but only partly bioavailable (50 %) to the target organ (blood system) due to its biokinetic properties. After single exposure it was shown to be toxic after oral or inhalative administration, but was not irritant or skin sensitizer. Consequently, the proposed classification for acute toxicity was T, R23/25 'Toxic by inhalation and if swallowed'. After repeated oral or inhalative administration, the critical effect was the induction of haemolytic anaemia, with secondary effects in the spleen, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. The possible classification with Xn; R48/22 or T; R48/25 ('Harmful or Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed') could not be agreed by the experts, but the classification T, R48/23 'Toxic: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure through inhalation' was proposed. Triazoxide did not show genotoxic or carcinogenic properties in the available studies. No specific adverse effects on fertility were observed in the multi-generation rat study, but the classification R64 'May cause harm to breastfed babies' was proposed based on reduced pup survival during lactation that could be expected to result from the presence of triazoxide in milk. No developmental toxicity or teratogenic activity was observed in rats or rabbits. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0002 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 2-year rat study and using a safety factor of 100, increased by an additional safety factor of 3. This was justified by the use of a lowest observed adverse effect level, the steep dose-response in the study and the absence of mechanistic information. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 90-day rat study, using a safety factor of 100 and a correction for bioavailability (50 %). The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 0.015 mg/kg bw, based on the 4-week rat study and applying a safety factor of 100. The dermal absorption values to be used in the risk assessment are 2.4 % for the concentrate and 2 % for the contaminated grain dust. The operator exposure estimates during the seed treatment are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but realistic field studies show an exposure level up to 21 % of the AOEL with the use of coverall and gloves. Similarly, the exposure estimates for the worker loading and sowing treated seed are above the AOEL with the SeedTropex model, but below the AOEL considering a field study (26 %), with the use of long-sleeved shirt and long trousers. Bystander exposure is not expected to exceed the exposure of workers involved in loading/sowing treated seed (i.e. 26 % of the AOEL). Based on the new metabolism study conducted on barley with seeds treated at dose rates of 3 and 30 g a.s./100 kg seeds (N and 10N studies when compared to the critical GAP), the residue was defined as triazoxide alone for monitoring and as sum of triazoxide, desoxy-triazoxide (M01) and triazoxideamino (M02) for risk assessment. A conversion factor of 6 was proposed for risk assessment derived from the metabolism study, taking into account the respective percentage at which each compound was detected in straw. A new residue data set was submitted where samples were analysed using an analytical method achieving a LOQ of 0.001 mg/kg, and the MRL for barley grain was proposed at the LOQ value. Such an unusually low value was proposed, given the low ADI agreed for the parent compound. The residue data are supported by the storage stability study showing triazoxide residues to be stable up to 2 years when stored frozen at -18 degrees C. Processing studies were not submitted and are not required. The available data are sufficient to conclude that significant residues are not expected to be present in rotational crops. Estimated intakes by animals were calculated to be below the trigger value of 0.1 mg/kg DM. A goat metabolism study was however provided in order to confirm that transfer of residues in animal matrices is not expected at levels that could be of concern for the consumers. Since the total radioactive residues (TRRs) in goat matrices were shown to be below 0.0005 mg/kg when expressed on a 1N rate basis, the setting of a residue definition and proposing MRLs for animal matrices were considered not necessary. No chronic or acute risks were identified for the consumers, with the TMDI being less that 4 % of the ADI and the IESTI less that 0.1 % of the ARfD when calculations are performed using the EFSA PRIMo model, the proposed MRL of 0.001 mg/kg for barley, and the conversion factor of 6. Triazoxide may be considered to be highly to very highly persistent in soil under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C (DT50 (lab) ((biphasic kinetic, overall)) = 208 - 278 days). The degradation of triazoxide proceeds either through reduction to M01, or through production of M02. The assessment based on the decline from the peak observed indicated that metabolite M01 was moderately persistent in soil (DissT(50) (lab) = 32.4 - 56.7 days), and metabolite M02 could be considered highly persistent (decline M02 DissT(50 field) = 239 - 313 days; excluding the UK field trial where no decline is observed). Unextracted residues amounted to a maximum of 29.8 % AR after 120 days (end of the study). Mineralization was practically negligible in the four soils tested. Photolysis slightly enhances degradation of triazoxide in soil, but it is not expected to contribute significantly to its environmental dissipation. According to the available studies, triazoxide may be considered as low to medium mobile in soil (K-foc = 245 - 1743 mL / g), metabolite M01 may be considered slightly mobile (K-foc = 2053 - 4148 mL / g), and metabolite M02 may be considered low to medium mobile (K-foc = 385.6 - 1709.0 mL / g). The narrow range of pH and the ionisable character of the metabolite M02 were noted. Whereas a large margin of safety is considered to exist for the representative use, further data could be needed if other uses at significantly higher application rates are applied for in the future. Triazoxide was stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, practically stable at pH 7, and readily hydrolysed at pH 9 (DT50 = 6.6 days). The main hydrolysis metabolite was M04. Triazoxide is rapidly photolysed in water (DT50 = 24.4 hours equivalent to 3.5 natural solar days at 33 degrees N). An additional study indicated that the photolysis half-life of triazoxide in water is expected to range from 1.7 to 9.7 days, depending on the season and the latitude (30 - 50 degrees N). No ready biodegradability study is available and therefore triazoxide is considered not readily biodegradable. In aquatic water / sediment systems, triazoxide dissipated rapidly from water to sediment phase, and broke down to form the metabolites M01 and M05. Unextractable residues in the sediment amounted up to 55.7 % AR in the sediment after 91 days). Mineralization was negligible in both systems. The limited sampling regime of these experiments prevents the calculation of reliable kinetic parameters. However, a simple non-linear kinetic analysis was presented by the applicant to derive dissipation and degradation rates of triazoxide and metabolite M01 in the water sediment systems. This kinetic analysis was only partially validated (only whole system results for the Lienden system were confirmed). For the IJzendoorn system, no reliable whole system half-lives for the parent compound and metabolite M01 were obtained due to poor fit. Worst-case whole system half-lives of 4.3 days and 323 days were estimated for triazoxide and metabolite M01, respectively, based on results of the Lienden system. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments (Predicted environmental concentrations (PEC)) were carried out for triazoxide as well as the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 using the FOCUS step 1, step 2 and step 3 approach. For the metabolites M01 and M05 the available step 1 and step 2 values are relied on for the risk assessment. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A. The necessary groundwater exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using FOCUS scenarios and the models PEARL 3.3.3 and PELMO 3.3.2 for the active substance triazoxide and the metabolites M01 and M02. To assess the risk associated with preferential transport through structured soils the Chateaudun scenarios were also simulated using the MACRO model. Detailed information about model parameterisation is provided in the list of end points in Appendix A. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses for these compounds above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations represented by all relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. Triazoxide is not expected to significantly volatilize or to be subject to long-range transport in air. The first-tier short-term TER values for granivorous birds were above the Annex VI trigger values, indicating a low risk. The margin of safety (TER=23.5) was considered to cover the uncertainty related to the derivation of a short-term toxicity end point, due to food avoidance (end point based on consumption in group where there was 30 % mortality). Further refinements were required to address the acute and long-term risk to birds. Based on yellowhammer as focal species, the acute TER value was calculated to be 9.1. Yellowhammer would have to consume 159 (including a 10-fold uncertainty factor) seeds on an acute time scale to breach the Annex VI trigger. This number of seeds would cover approximately 3.45 m(2) of a field, and the number of seeds would cover 90 % of the daily food requirement of a yellowhammer. Furthermore, worst-case field studies indicated that yellowhammer could consume 1/3 of the critical number of seeds in one feeding event. Given these facts, in addition to the indication of food avoidance behaviour detected in the short-term dietary study, it was concluded that the risk to granivorous birds from consumption of treated seeds could be considered to be low on an acute timescale. The conclusion was supported by an additional assessment for a fast-feeding granivorous bird like the woodpigeon. A long-term risk assessment on reproductive birds was considered relevant for the spring use of triazoxide as a seed treatment. A refined long-term TER of 2.23 was calculated based on residue decline data for triazoxide in barley seed on soil surface. Further refinements were needed to address the long-term risk to granivorous birds from the spring use. Following the initial risk assessment, further data and refinements were considered during the resubmission. Four species were identified as focal species (skylark, chaffinch, woodpigeon and yellowhammer) in the Additional Report. Further information was provided supporting the proportion of the food obtained in the treated area (PT) for each focal species as well as the proportion of food types obtained from the treated crop (PD). The refined TER values were above the Annex VI trigger values for all representative focal species, therefore the long-term risk to granivorous birds for both the use in autumn and spring sown barley was assessed as low. The tier 1 acute risk assessment for granivorous mammals was found to be low. Further refinements were required with regard to the long-term risk assessment for granivorous mammals. The refinements in the original review were based on wood mouse as focal species and on use of measured residue data, however they were considered as not satisfactory and further refinements were required to address the long-term risk to granivorous mammals. During the resubmission application further data were provided to refine the risk assessment. However, the higher tier risk assessment gave a TERlt below the Annex VI trigger value, indicating a potential high long-term risk. Therefore, the long-term risk assessment to granivorous mammals needs further refinements and a data gap remains. The issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern. Risk assessment of secondary poisoning and consumption of contaminated water was considered not relevant. Triazoxide is proposed to be classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. The acute and chronic risk to aquatic organisms was considered to be low. Furthermore, the risk to sediment-dwelling organisms from the metabolites M01, M02 and M05 was considered as low. The acute risk to earthworms was considered to be low. The long-term risk from triazoxide and the soil metabolites M01 and M02 to earthworms was considered as low. Concerning other soil non-target macro-organisms, the risk to springtails was considered low for all potential soil residues. In addition, the potential risk from triazoxide and its metabolites to soil litter degradation processes was assessed as low. The risk to bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low, as was the risk to soil non-target micro-organisms, biological methods of sewage treatment, and non-target plants.",NA
NA,"Modification of the existing MRLs for propamocarb in leek, spinach, witloof and lamb's lettuce",2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2094,"According to Article 6 of the Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, Ireland, herewith referred to as the Evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the company Bayer CropScience Europe to modify the existing MRLs for propamocarb in leek, spinach, lamb` s lettuce and witloof. In order to accommodate for the intended use of propamocarb on these crops in various Northern and/or Southern European Member States, it is proposed to raise the existing MRLs for this active substance. The EMS Ireland drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA on 13 September 2010. EFSA derives the following conclusions based on the submitted evaluation report prepared by the EMS, the EFSA conclusion on the peer review of propamocarb as well as the Draft Assessment Report (DAR) prepared by the rapporteur Member State (RMS) Ireland under Directive 91/414/EEC. It has to be noted that in the plant protection product formulations propamocarb is mainly used in a form of a salt -propamocarb hydrochloride. All studies investigated in the framework of the peer review have been performed with propamocarb hydrochloride. Propamocarb and propamocarb hydrochloride have different molecular weights and therefore the molecular weight conversion factors have to be applied to convert the residue data depending on the scope of their use. The toxicological profile of propamocarb hydrochloride was assessed in the framework of the peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC and the data were sufficient to derive an ADI of 0.29 mg/kg bw/day and an ARfD of 1 mg/kg bw. In order to perform the risk assessment compliant with the risk assessment residue definition, the ADI and ARfD for propamocarb hydrochloride were recalculated to propamocarb by applying the molecular weight conversion factor. The derived ADI value for propamocarb is 0.244 mg/kg bw/d and the ARfD is 0.84 mg/kg bw. The metabolism of propamocarb hydrochloride in primary crops was investigated in fruiting vegetables, leaf vegetables and root and tuber vegetables. The residue definition in plant commodities for monitoring and risk assessment was proposed by the peer review to be restricted to propamocarb and its salts, the sum being expressed as propamocarb. The same residue definition is established in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. Codex Alimentarius Commission has established the residue definition for the risk assessment and enforcement in all plants as propamocarb (free base). EFSA concludes that the metabolism of propamocarb hydrochloride in the crops under consideration is sufficiently addressed and no further metabolism studies are required. The same residue definitions as derived by the peer review are applicable. After having assessed the available residue data, EFSA concludes that the MRL of 10 mg/kg in witloof, 50 mg/kg in spinach and 20 mg/kg in leek would be appropriate for the intended uses of propamocarb on these crops in various Northern and/or Southern European countries. The intended use on lamb` s lettuce is not supported by the residue data and therefore no MRL proposal can be derived. To check the compliance of the MRLs for propamocarb in high water content crops, an adequate analytical enforcement method is available. The effect of processing on the nature of propamocarb residues was not investigated in the framework of the peer review under Directive 91/414/EEC. No specific studies investigating the effect of processing on the magnitude of propamocarb residues have been submitted under the current application. Spinach and leek are mainly consumed processed. Considering the high acute consumer exposure from the residues in spinach and leek, the studies investigating the effect of processing on the nature and magnitude of propamocarb residues are desirable. In the soil under field conditions 90% of propamocarb is degraded within 100 days and therefore the possible occurrence of propamocarb residues in rotational/succeeding crops was not further investigated under the current application. Residues of propamocarb in commodities of animal origin were not assessed in the framework of this application, since the crops under consideration are normally not fed to livestock. The consumer risk assessment was performed with revision 2 of the EFSA Pesticide Residues Intake Model (PRIMo). For the calculation of the chronic exposure, EFSA used the median residue value as derived from the residue trials on the crops under consideration. For other food commodities of plant and animal origin the MRLs established in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 were used as input values. The estimated exposure was then compared with the toxicological reference values derived for propamocarb. No long-term consumer intake concerns were identified for any of the European diets incorporated in the EFSA PRIMo. The total calculated intake accounted for a maximum of 78.2% of the ADI (DE child diet). The contribution of residues in the crops under consideration to the total consumer exposure accounted for a maximum of 4.64% of the ADI for spinach (FR toddler diet), 0.74% of the ADI for leek (FR toddler diet) and 0.014% of the ADI for witloof (NL child diet). No acute consumer risk was identified in relation to the MRL proposals for witloof (44.5% of the ARfD). For spinach and leek an acute consumer risk could not be excluded. The calculated maximum exposure accounted for 121.1% of the ARfD for spinach and 105.3% of the ARfD for leek. Lacking adequate processing data, a more refined consumer exposure assessment could not be performed. It is noted that for the less critical use of propamocarb on spinach in the NEU a MRL proposal could be derived which does not lead to an unacceptable acute consumer exposure (48.4% of the ARfD). This MRL proposal, however, confirms the existing EU MRL for spinach. EFSA concludes that the intended use of propamocarb on witloof will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore will not pose a public health concern. An acute consumer risk could not be excluded regarding the MRL proposals for leek and spinach (resulting from the SEU use) and therefore these intended uses could not be supported. The recommendations of EFSA are compiled in the table below: [GRAPHICS] .",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance propanil European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2085,"Propanil is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002,(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.(4) In accordance with Article 10(1) of the Regulation, Italy, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS), provided an initial evaluation of propanil in the format of a Draft Assessment Report (DAR), which was received by the EFSA on 28 November 2007. The Commission of the European Communities (hereafter referred to as, the Commission.) examined propanil in accordance with Article 11a of the Regulation and it was concluded that there were clear indications of harmful effects, leading to the adoption of a decision on non-inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in accordance with Articles 11f and 12 of the Regulation. Following the Commission Decision of 30 September 2008 (2008/769/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of propanil in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Propanil Data Development Consortium made a resubmission application for the inclusion of propanil in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008.(6) The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Italy, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 26 February 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 2 March 2010. The DAR was also distributed for comments. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 20 April 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour in the environment and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on propanil. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of propanil as a herbicide on rice, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis no critical areas of concern were identified. Data gaps were identified for one of the specifications, methods of analysis and formulation storage stability and physical properties. In the area of mammalian toxicology, two data gaps were identified: the determination of the toxicological relevance of one impurity, and information to allow the setting of reference values (ADI and ARfD) for the plant metabolite 3,4-DCA. Since the composition of the batches used in the toxicological studies was not demonstrated to cover the technical specification, this is considered as a critical area of concern. Based on the metabolism study conducted on rice the residue for monitoring and risk assessment was defined as ""all compounds containing the 3,4-DCA moiety, free and conjugated"". No MRL was proposed for rice, as the submitted trials were not performed according to the cGAP and a data gap was identified. A critical area of concern was identified in the residue section, as the consumer risk assessment could not be conducted. The data available on fate and behaviour in the environment are insufficient for the required environmental exposure assessments in line with the agreed EU MED-Rice (2003) guidance; therefore several data gaps were identified during the peer review. It could however be concluded that in situations represented by the scenarios in the EU MED-Rice guidance, the potential for groundwater exposure from the representative use by propanil or the metabolite 3,4-DCA above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is expected to be low. This conclusion however is based on only the limited data set available. Propanil has a potential for long-range transport through the atmosphere, therefore this was identified as a critical area of concern. Five data gaps were identified in ecotoxicology section, to further address the acute and long-term risk of propanil to birds, the long-term risk to mammals and the risk to non target-arthropods. The risk of metabolites DCNB, DCAB and TCAB to non-target species should be addressed. Acute risk to birds, long-term risk to birds, long-term risk to mammals, the risk to aquatic organisms and the risk to nontarget arthropods were identified as critical area of concerns in the ecotoxicology section.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance phosmet,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2162,"Phosmet is one of the 52 substances of the second stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 451/20003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on phosmet in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of the amended Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, which was received by the EFSA on 23 August 2004. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 03 September 2004 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the sole applicant Margarita Internacional. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed in an evaluation meeting on 18 May 2005. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in September 2005. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 6 April 2006 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 12 May 2006 (EFSA Scientific Report (2006) 75). Phosmet was included in Annex I of Directive 91/414 by Commission Directive 2007/25/EC of 23 April, 20075. The entry into force of the Annex I inclusion was 1 October 2007. In March 2010 the European Commission received a request to modify the ADI for phosmet, based on an evaluation of new toxicological data carried out by the United Kingdom following an application from Gowan Comercio Internacional e Servicos. In compliance with the Guidance Document SANCO 10328/2006 rev. 6, the European Commission invited all Member States and EFSA to provide comments on the new evaluation. Following consideration of the comments received, the European Commission requested EFSA to organise a peer review of the new evaluation and to deliver its conclusions on the new proposed ADI for phosmet. The conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an acaracide and insecticide as proposed by the applicant which comprises tractor-mounted spraying and airblast assisted sprayers in orchards. Application is made to citrus fruit at a rate of 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare, pome fruit at 0.3 kg phosmet per hectare and potatoes at 0.5 kg phosmet per hectare. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Imidan 50 WP a wettable powder (WP) registered under different trade names in Europe. The representative uses assessed were located in southern Europe only as stated in the application for annex 1 listing. No conclusion on the equivalence of the two sources could be made as some mammalian toxicology data were missing. In the main adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. The residue definition for water can not be finalised due to outstanding ecotoxicology data. The method for body fluids and tissues is currently only validated for phosmet and as the oxon is in the residue definition further validation data will be required. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Limited analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There are some outstanding issues related to the relevant impurities. The toxicological risk assessment is based on the assumption that the studies have been performed with a test material that covers the current technical specification. The absorption is rapid and almost complete, there is no accumulation in tissues and the excretion is mainly via urine. Phosmet is toxic by oral administration and the proposed classification is T, R25. It is non-irritant to skin and eyes and does not cause sensitisation by skin contact. The critical effect after repeated exposure is depression of the plasma, erythrocyte and brain acetylcholinesterase activities. The most sensitive species is the dog. Phosmet is an in vitro but not in vivo genotoxic agent. Increased incidence of liver tumours is observed in mice at the highest dose level (14 mg/kg bw/day), higher than controls but within the same range as historical control data. In a two-generation study with rats, the fertility parameters and the offspring are not directly affected. Phosmet shows no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbits, and no potential to induce delayed neurotoxicity. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is 0.01 mg/kg bw/day, based on a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg bw/day from the rat multigeneration study, supported by short-term studies in dogs and rats and a long-term study in rats. The Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.045 mg/kg bw and the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) 0.02 mg/kg bw/day. For the use on potatoes and pomes, exposure estimates according to the German model are below the AOEL for operators wearing personal protective equipment and respiratory protective equipment. In spite of these high protection measures, the operator exposure is above the AOEL during application on citrus fruits. Estimates of worker and bystander exposure are below the AOEL for all the supported uses. Plant metabolism studies with 14C-phosmet in cherries, potatoes and corn are available covering the representative uses. A common metabolic pathway is proposed. Phosmet is able to penetrate through the plant surface where the main metabolic reactions take place. Within the plant tissues only a limited transport is observed. The primary metabolic reactions are hydrolysis and conjugation reactions which produce phthalic acid and a range of related compounds, none of them containing the phosphorodithioate group. Oxidation reaction leading to the oxygen analogue phosmet oxon is a minor metabolic reaction. Considering the fact that oxygen analogue compounds are of high toxicity and the fact that no specific information on the toxicological significance of this compound is available, it was concluded to include phosmet oxon in the residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring purposes. However, pending on the outcome of the study aimed to address the relative potency of phosmet oxon in comparison with the parent compound, it might be necessary to reconsider the residue definitions. Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/ kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group. Supervised residue trials in oranges, apples and potatoes have been submitted, which allow the proposal of the following MRLs: oranges and pome fruit: 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, potatoes: 0.02* mg/kg. No MRLs are proposed for other citrus fruit as the available trials in oranges are not suitable for extrapolation to the whole crop group. The effects of processing on the nature and the level of residues were investigated. Under conditions simulating pasteurisation, baking/brewing/boiling and sterilisation, phosmet degraded to less toxic compounds or compounds that occurred also in animal metabolism studies. The transfer factors to apple juice, apple pure and canned apples were very low, with residues essentially left in the pomace and peel fractions. Studies on succeeding or rotational crops are not required due to the fast degradation of phosmet in soil. Livestock can be exposed to residues of phosmet through consumption of fruit pomace and potatoes. Metabolism studies in lactating goat and laying hens demonstrated that phosmet will not occur in animal tissues, milk and eggs when livestock is fed with feed produced according to GAP for the supported use. The consumer risk assessment was carried out taking into account chronic and acute exposures according to the provisional residue definition (sum of phosmet and phosmet oxon, expressed as phosmet). The calculations indicate that the exposure will be below the ADI and the ARfD, respectively. In aerobic laboratory soil degradation studies (20 degrees C, 21-50% soil maximum water holding capacity) phosmet exhibited low persistence and did not form any major (>10% AR) extractable non volatile soil metabolites. The major sink for the radiolabels used in the experiments was mineralisation to CO2 (5377% applied radioactivity (AR) at 120-150 days). Residue not extracted by acetone /acidified acetone accounted for 17-38% AR at 150 days. In field dissipation studies carried out in the USA phosmet also exhibited low persistence. Under laboratory (23 degrees C) anaerobic soil conditions the major (14.5% AR) metabolite N-hydroxymethyl phthalamic acid was identified. Based in the results of laboratory batch adsorption studies phosmet exhibited low mobility being considered immobile in one of the four soils tested. In a BBA guideline lysimeter study carried out in Switzerland that covers the applied for representative uses if applications are made in July, there was no leaching of radioactivity (excluding CO2) in collected leachate samples > 0.06 mu g/L, confirming the results of FOCUS scenario groundwater modelling for parent phosmet and indicating leaching of the soil metabolites that are formed at low levels is unlikely to be significant. All this information indicates, that for the applied for intended uses, the potential for groundwater exposure above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L is negligible. In laboratory (20 degrees C) natural sediment water systems phosmet both dissipated rapidly by partitioning to sediment and degraded rapidly, resulting in it exhibiting very low persistence. The major (>10% AR) metabolites identified were: phthalamic acid phthalic acid and N-hydroxymethyl phthalimide. Based on the available sterile hydrolysis studies and laboratory aqueous photolysis study O, Odimethylphosphorodithioc acid and O, O-dimethylphosphoric acid may also be formed as major metabolites in natural surface waters. In sediment the only major component of the residue in addition to phosmet was phthalamic acid. All these identified breakdown products were themselves relatively labile. CO2 from the carbonyl radiolabel used in the natural sediment water studies was the major sink for the applied radioactivity (accounting for 80-92% AR at 100 days). FOCUS step 2 to 4 surface water assessments have been completed for parent phosmet (with step 4 just considering spray drift mitigation) but only southern European scenarios and then only early season application timings were simulated. As the applied for representative southern European uses assessed are not restricted to applications only being made later in the growing season, if phosmet is included in annex 1, then southern member states where later season uses are applied for, should carry out national assessments of the potential for surface water exposure and associated aquatic risk assessments from the drainage and runoff routes of entry to surface water, as it is not clear that the available EU level assessment covers these situations. Also the current assessment identifies that for the early season application southern European scenarios assessed, only 1 scenario for each crop (D6 potatoes, R4 citrus and pome fruit), represented a low risk to aquatic organisms without mitigation to reduce runoff input to surface water being considered. For all other geoclimatic situations assessed high risk was identified when only the spray drift risk was mitigated. A high acute risk to insectivorous birds was identified for all evaluated uses and also for herbivorous birds in potatoes. The initially identified high long-term risk to birds for all evaluated uses was reassessed based on measured residues in insects and grass. The refined long-term TER values for birds are above the Annex VI trigger. For a generic herbivorous mammal a potential high long-term risk was identified for all uses. The refined assessment based on selected focal mammalian species needs to be further justified. Phosmet is very toxic to aquatic organisms. Since data on acute toxicity to seven fish species are available the safety factor was lowered from 100 to 20. Risk mitigation measures to reduce spray drift input corresponding to 40 m in orchards and 20 m in potatoes are needed in order to meet this trigger for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. Based on data from an available mesocosm study, the same buffer zones will also be sufficient to protect aquatic invertebrates in southern Europe in case of early application for one FOCUS scenario in each crop. The risk assessment for the aquatic environment needs to be complemented with scenarios for later in the season, when drainage and runoff routes of entry are likely to contribute to the concentration in surface water from the assessed uses in southern Europe. Phosmet is very toxic to bees. The high risk needs to be managed at Member State level. Application should be avoided when there are likely to be any bees in the crop and a withholding period needs to be established. The risk to non-target arthropods is high. A potential for in-field recolonisation has been demonstrated, however further data is required to address the impact off-field and the potential for recolonisation from off-field areas. The risk to earthworms, other non-target soil macro-organisms, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment is considered to be low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance acetochlor European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2143,"Acetochlor is one of the 79 substances of the third stage, part A, of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3) as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1095/2007. This Regulation required the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within one year a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission. Spain being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on acetochlor in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 4 April 2005. Following a quality check on the DAR, the peer review was initiated on 14 December 2005 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicant Task Force consisting of Dow AgroSciences and Monsanto Europe S.A. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined by the rapporteur Member State and the need for additional data was agreed on during a written procedure in August - September 2006. Remaining issues as well as further data made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in March 2007. A discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place with representatives from the Member States on 27 September 2007 leading to the conclusions as laid down in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 31 July 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 153) Following the Commission Decision of 05 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(4) concerning the non-inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants made a resubmission application for the inclusion of acetochlor in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(5). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues and concerns identified in the DAR leading to the decision on non-inclusion. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Spain being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 22 April 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 26 April 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the Commission on 9 June 2010. The collated comments were also forwarded to the RMS for compilation in the format of a Reporting Table. The applicants were invited to respond to the comments in column 3 of the Reporting Table. The comments and the applicant's response were evaluated by the RMS in column 3. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology, residues, fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology and deliver its conclusions on acetochlor. The conclusion of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a herbicide on maize as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A. The representative formulated products for the evaluation were ""GF-675"" and ""Mon 69447"" a 400 g/L capsule suspension (CS) and an 840 g/L emulsifiable concentrate (EC) respectively Residues in food of plant origin are analysed using a common moiety method by LC-MS/MS, data gaps have been identified for validation of the extraction and hydrolysis steps for each metabolite and ILV for the method. Consequently, no valid method is available to quantify residues in food of plant origin. For products of animal origin a method is not required as no MRLs are proposed. For soil a LC-MS/MS method is available that analyses for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfonic acid (7), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) and s-sulfonic acid (13). For surface/ground/drinking water LCMS/MS methods are available for acetochlor, t-oxanilic acid (2), t- sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) t- norchloroacetochlor (6) and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3). In addition to this there is also a LCMS/MS method for t-norchloroacetochlor (6) in drinking water. Air can be analysed for acetochlor by LC-MS/MS. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Acetochlor has a moderate acute toxicity. The proposed classification is Xn, R20/22 Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; Xi, R37/38 Irritating to respiratory system and skin; R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact. In short term studies the dog was the most sensitive species showing decreased body weight gain and histopathological findings in kidneys and testes. Based on the findings in the 52-week study in dog the risk phrase R48/22 ""Harmful: danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"". Many in vitro genotoxicity studies showed positive results but the in vivo tests did not indicate clearly a mutagenic potential. In long term studies different types of tumours were observed with increased incidences and the classification Carc. cat. 3, R40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect was proposed. No specific effect on the reproductive parameters was found in multigeneration studies with rats, and no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in rats or rabbits. The groundwater metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7), s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) were considered toxicologically relevant taking into account the limited information available and the carcinogenic potential of the parent compound. The reference values of acetochlor are applicable to the plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.0036 mg/kg bw/day using the LOAEL from the 78-week mouse study with a safety factor of 300. The acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL) is 0.02 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study, with the use of a safety factor of 100. The acute reference dose (ARfD) is 1.5 mg/kg bw, derived from the acute rat neurotoxicity study with the application of a safety factor of 100. Two representative formulations were considered in the exposure assessment. For 'GF-675', the operator exposure is below the AOEL with the use of gloves and coverall during mixing/loading and application, and sturdy footwear during application. For 'MON 69447', the estimates with the German and UK models are above the AOEL but a bio-monitoring study measured exposures below the AOEL with the use of tractors and gloves during mixing/loading and coverall during application. Metabolism of acetochlor was studied in maize plants upon pre-emergence and post-emergence application. Acetochlor was seen to be extensively metabolised, the residues being composed of numerous individual metabolites of which, more than 30 were identified, each accounting for less than 3% of the TRR. The residue definitions were therefore extensively discussed during the PRAPeR 20 and the teleconference TC46 and it was finally agreed to define the residue for monitoring as ""all compounds forming EMA (34) and HEMA (33) on hydrolysis expressed as acetochlor"", considering that the common moieties method developed by the applicant is able to take into account a significant part of the residues. The N-oxamic acid (68) metabolite was added to the EMA and HEMA forming metabolites, in the residue definition for risk assessment and a conversion factor of 2 was proposed for the consumer risk assessment. These residue definitions are also relevant to assess the residues in rotational crops. Supervised trials confirmed that residues in maize grains, when analysed for EMA and HEMA, are below the limit of quantification. Inversely, significant residues were detected in maize forage. Based on the different ruminant metabolism studies, it was concluded that no residues are expected to be present in animal matrices when considering the intakes resulting from the residues present in maize forage and maize grains. Therefore, the setting of a residue definition and MRLs for products of animal origin was considered not necessary. No chronic or acute risks were identified when the consumer exposures to food commodities are calculated using the EFSA PRIMo Model and the MRL proposed for maize grains and oil seeds. However, it must be highlighted that the potential consumer exposure exceeds the ADI value in many scenario, when the predicted concentrations of the ground water metabolites are considered. In addition, intakes for toddlers and infants resulting from the water consumption are at times above the threshold value of 20% ADI recommended by the WHO, when calculations are conducted using the concentrations measured in a monitoring program conducted in Northern Italy. In topsoil under aerobic conditions acetochlor exhibits low to moderate persistence forming the major soil metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max 17 % applied radioactivity (AR)) and t-sulfonic acid (7) (max 11.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to high persistence and t-sulfinylacetic acid (3) (max 18% AR) which exhibited medium to high persistence. The minor soil metabolites s-sulfonic acid (13) (max 9.8% AR) which exhibited moderate to medium persistence and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 3.3% AR) were also identified. Mineralisation of the phenyl radiolabel to carbon dioxide accounted only 0.3-3.1 % of applied radioactivity (AR) after 96 days. The formation of unextractable residues was also a significant sink accounting for 15-41 % AR after 84-90 days. Acetochlor exhibits high to medium mobility in soil. t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinyl acetic acid (3) and t-sulfonic acid (7) exhibit very high to high mobility in soil and s-sulfonic acid (13) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) exhibit very high mobility in soil. There was no indication that adsorption of either acetochlor or these 5 metabolites was pH dependant. In natural sediment water systems acetochlor exhibited moderate persistence degrading to the major metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2) (max. 13.1% AR in water) and t-norchloro acetochlor (6) (max 10.4% AR in water 19.2% AR in sediment). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a small sink in the material balance accounting for only 1.4-2.7 % AR at 100 days. Unextracted sediment residues were the most significant sink for radioactivity representing 24-50 % AR at 100 days. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for acetochlor at steps 1-4, with spray drift and runoff mitigation being applied at step 4. These exposure assessments as required for metabolites were completed at steps 1-2. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. The potential for groundwater exposure from the applied for intended uses above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L by parent acetochlor was concluded to be low, in geoclimatic situations that are represented by all 9 FOCUS groundwater scenarios. A high potential for groundwater contamination > 0.1 mu g/L over significant areas of the EU by the metabolites t-oxanilic acid (2), t-sulfinylacetic acid (3), t-sulfonic acid (7) and s-sulfonic acid (13) that have (on the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data) been concluded as relevant metabolites was identified. A data gap is identified for the stability of the metabolites t-norchloroacetochlor (6) and thydroxyacetochlor (17) in stored frozen groundwater samples. These data are required to finalise the groundwater exposure assessment for these two metabolites. The short-term TER for birds and the acute and long-term TERs for mammals were above the trigger of 10 and 5 in the first-tier risk assessment. A residue decline study was submitted. The acute risk to herbivorous birds was sufficiently addressed on the basis of measured residues. However the suggested PD and PT values to refine the long-term risk to herbivorous birds were assessed and considered as not supported by the submitted data. The refined risk assessment for insectivorous birds based on crested lark (Galerida cristata) was agreed by the meeting. The risk from consumption of contaminated water was assessed as low for mammals.. It was agreed in the expert meeting, that the risk to mammals is low. However a high acute risk was indicated for birds for post-emergence applications where accumulation of water in leaf axils of maize plants can occur. The risk from secondary poisoning of fish-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low in the first tier but further refinement was required for earthworm-eating birds and mammals. The risk was sufficiently addressed using data from a bioconcentration study with earthworms. The risk from soil metabolites was considered to be low because their log Pow is <3 suggesting a low potential of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Endpoints from acute toxicity studies with rats were available for the major plant metabolite N-oxamic acid (68) and for metabolite 3 (t-sulfinylacetic acid). No information on the toxicity to birds was available. In the risk assessment it was assumed that the metabolites have a similar toxicity to birds as the parent. The acute and long-term TERs for birds and mammals were above the triggers of 10 and 5. However some uncertainty remains because of the high proportion of unidentified residues in the residue trials (up to 39% of TRR) and one of the unknown compounds exceeded the threshold of 10% of TRR. The risk from plant metabolites to herbivorous birds was addressed in the additional report. Acetochlor is very toxic to all groups of aquatic organisms and a high risk was indicated in the risk assessment with FOCUS step3 PECsw. A risk refinement based on endpoints from a static mesocosm and from a mesocosm with a pulsed exposure regime was used to refine the risk in lentic and lotic water bodies. The experts agreed that the NOAEC of 0.2 mu g acetochlor/L for lentic water bodies and the NOAEC of 2 mu g acetochlor/L for lotic water bodies should be used in the risk assessment together with an assessment factor of 2-3. No FOCUS step 4 scenario resulted in a TER exceeding the trigger of 2 even when no-spray buffer zones of 20m and vegetated filter strips of 20m were applied to mitigate the risk. Overall it is concluded that the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to acetochlor is high for the representative uses evaluated. The risk from metabolites in water and sediment was assessed as low. The bioconcentration potential of acetochlor was assessed as low. A high in-field risk was identified for both indicator arthropod species for the representative uses with the lead formulation GF-675. Extended laboratory studies indicated a low risk to Aphidius rhopalosiphi but the LD50 for Typhlodromus pyri was below the suggested application rate. However the trigger is met for the off-field area and considering the short half life of acetochlor on vegetation it was considered as likely that re-colonisation is possible. In addition no mortality was observed in the standard laboratory tests with the leaf dwelling species C. carnea at dose rates of 2000 g a.s./ha. Therefore it was concluded in the expert meeting that the risk to leaf dwelling arthropods is low. The risk to soil surface dwelling arthropods from exposure to acetochlor and its soil metabolites was considered to be low. The acute risk of acetochlor to earthworms was assessed as low. No long-term risk assessment is triggered because the representative uses cover only one application per year and the field DT90 is < 100 days. The acute and long-term risk from soil metabolites to earthworms was assessed as low. A high risk to non-target terrestrial plants was identified and risk mitigation measures such as a 5m infield no spray buffer zone are required. The risk to bees, soil macro-organisms, soil-micro organisms, organic matter breakdown and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses of acetochlor.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bifenthrin,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2159,"Bifenthrin is one of the 79 substances of the third stage Part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the European Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission. France being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on bifenthrin in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 15 December 2005. The peer review was initiated on 1 June 2006 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 12 May 2006 to the sole applicant FMC Chemicals. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues which were agreed during a written procedure in February 2008. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June -July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion finalised on 30 September 2008 (EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 186). Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/887/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant FMC Chemicals made a resubmission application for the inclusion of bifenthrin in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20086. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/125/08) as follows: The fate and behaviour in soil and water, due to the possible presence of major soil metabolites, the relevance of which must be determined and, if necessary, further assessed. As a consequence, the risk to groundwater, could not be finalised; The risk to aquatic organisms which, with the exception of invertebrates and algae, does not generate an acceptable use; The risk to several species of mammals, non-target arthropods, non-target plants and nontarget soil macro-organisms. and concerns were identified with regard to: The risk to consumers, which may be underestimated, given the data gaps identified in the residue section, and the possible impact of the different isomers constituting bifenthrin; The potential for contamination of groundwater by the major soil metabolite TFP acid;. The unacceptable high risk to aquatic vertebrates; The long term risk to mammals; The risk from secondary poisoning of earthworm-eating mammals; The risk from bioaccumulation through the aquatic food chain which is not finalised; The risk to non-target arthropods (in-field), non-target plants and non-target soil macroorganisms which remains inconclusive. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, France, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 6 August 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 10 August 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 23 September 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on bifenthrin. The conclusion of the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as an insecticide, which comprise of foliar spraying in cereals, grape and pome fruit for the control of a broad range of foliar pests, sucking and biting insects, mites, aphids. Full details of the GAP can be found in Appendix A. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of bifenthrin as an insecticide on cereals, ornamentals and head cabbage, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was 'Talstar 8 SC', a suspension concentrate (SC) containing 80 g/l bifenthrin. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Adequate methods are available to monitor bifenthrin residues in food/feed of plant and animal origin, in the environmental matrices and in body fluids and tissues. As for mammalian toxicity, bifenthrin is ""Toxic if swallowed"" (R25), it is toxic by inhalation (R23 ""Toxic by inhalation"" proposed). Bifenthrin is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause skin sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). It is not a skin or eye irritant. The main effect observed for repeated exposures is tremor and/or neurotoxic effects. The relevant short-term toxicity NOAEL is 2.5 mg/kg bw/day in dogs whereas for long-term exposures the NOAELs is 4.7 mg/kg bw/day in rats. Bifenthrin did not show any genotoxic potential. Due to the occurrence of bladder leiomyosarcomas/hemangiopericytomas in mice and as their relevance to humans could not be excluded, and the historical control data were not conclusive, R40 (Carc. Cat. 3) was proposed. In multigeneration studies the relevant maternal NOAEL is 3.0 mg/kg bw/day and the reproductive NOAEL is 5 mg/kg bw/day, based on the occurrence of tremors and marginally lower body weight in the P and F1 generation females during gestation and lactation. Bifenthrin did not show any teratogenic potential (maternal NOAEL> 7.4 mg/kg bw/day and developmental NOAEL >2 mg/kg bw/day). Bifenthrin did not show developmental neurotoxicity potential. The ADI is 0.015 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1-year dog study with a SF of 100, supported by the developmental study in rats. The ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on the 90-day neurotoxicity study with a SF of 100. The AOEL is 0.0075 mg/kg bw/day (SF 100 and correction factor of 50% for limited oral absorption). The operator, worker and bystander exposure showed levels below the AOEL. In the metabolism studies on apples (fruit crops), cotton seed (pulses and oilseeds) and maize plants (cereals) bifenthrin was found to be the predominant compound of the total residues. No significant cis-trans isomerisation and translocation of residues through the plant were observed. The proposed global residue definition for monitoring and risk assessment in plant commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). Complete residue database were provided to support the representative uses on cereals (wheat, triticale, rye, barley and oat) for both Northern and Southern Europe and to propose MRLs while 4 additional residue trials are required on head cabbage (Northern Europe). The nature of the residues in processed commodities was sufficiently addressed for pasteurisation and baking, brewing and boiling but not for sterilisation. A data gap was identified to require a new hydrolysis study simulating the conditions of sterilisation to determine the nature of the residues in processed commodities. Based on the metabolism studies in ruminants and poultry, the proposed residue definition for monitoring for animal commodities is bifenthrin (sum of isomers). For risk assessment, the residue definition proposals are as follows: -ruminant liver and kidney: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and BP-acid, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment); -eggs, poultry liver: sum of bifenthrin (sum of isomers) and hydroxyl-methyl bifenthrin and its fatty acid conjugates, expressed as bifenthrin (conversion factor of 2 for monitoring to risk assessment); -for milk and all other animal products: bifenthrin (sum of isomers). The storage time interval of the samples from the residue trials on cereals and head cabbage and of the animal tissues from the feeding studies can be considered as covered by the available storage stability data. Under normal agricultural practices, bifenthrin residue levels in the edible parts of the rotational crops intended for human consumption and as feed items are expected to be below 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. No chronic and acute intake concerns were identified according to EFSA PRIMo rev. 2A model. The consumer risk assessment should be regarded as provisional pending the submission of the additional residue trials on head cabbage. The potential for a different degradation of bifenthrin enantiomers in plant and animal commodities was considered as sufficiently addressed since the S/R enantiomeric ratio of the parent bifenthrin was shown to remain unchanged (S/R ratio: 1/1) both in cereals and head cabbage samples from the residue trials and in fat samples from the rat. Based on the available residue datasets an MRL of 0.05 mg/kg is proposed for wheat, triticale and rye grain and a MRL of 0.1 mg/kg is set for barley and oat grain. A provisional MRL of 0.3 mg/kg is proposed for head cabbage. MRLs were also defined for animal matrices. In soil under aerobic conditions bifenthrin exhibits moderate to high persistence forming the major soil metabolite TFP acid (accounting for up to 11.6% of applied radioactivity (AR)) which exhibits low to moderate persistence and the minor non-transient metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin (accounting for up to 8.3% AR) which exhibits moderate persistence. Mineralisation of both the cyclopropyl and phenyl rings to carbon dioxide accounted for 30-39% AR after 90 days. The formation of unextractable residues was a sink that accounted for 14-18 % AR after 90 days. Bifenthrin is immobile in soil, 4'-OH bifenthrin is expected to be immobile in soil though there was a data gap identified to confirm this. Metabolite TFP acid exhibited very high to medium mobility. There was no indication that adsorption of either bifenthrin or 4'-OH bifenthrin was pH dependent, whereas TFP acid exhibited pH dependent adsorption. In dark natural sediment water systems bifenthrin degraded exhibiting high persistence in sediment to the metabolite 4'-OH bifenthrin in sediment (max. 11.1% AR). The terminal metabolite, CO2, was a sink in the material balance from both the cyclopropyl and phenyl radiolabels accounting for a maximum of 3-27 % AR at 99 days (study end). Unextracted sediment residues accounted for 6-14 % AR at study end. The necessary surface water and sediment exposure assessments were appropriately carried out using the agreed FOCUS scenarios approach for bifenthrin at steps 1-4, with spray drift and run-off mitigation being applied at step 4 for the applied for representative uses on cereals and head cabbage. For the metabolite TFP acid and additionally for the 4'-OH bifenthrin, appropriate FOCUS step 2 calculations were carried out. These values are the basis for the risk assessment discussed in this conclusion. Regarding the outdoor uses on ornamentals, a data gap was identified for exposure estimations for surface water and sediment. The potential for groundwater exposure from the representative uses on cereals and head cabbage by bifenthrin, TFP acid and 4'-OH bifenthrin above the parametric drinking water limit of 0.1 mu g/L, was concluded to be low in geoclimatic situations that are represented by the relevant FOCUS groundwater scenarios. The potential for groundwater exposure from the uses on ornamentals was accepted to be covered by the estimations available for cereals. Since bifenthrin and its two metabolites relevant for the environment consist of 2 enantiomers and because only limited information on the behaviour of the enantiomers of bifenthrin in the environment was available, a data gap regarding this issue remained. Low acute, short-term and long-term risks were indicated with the first-tier risk assessment for birds and a low acute risk was indicated for mammals for the outdoor representative uses. A potential high long-term risk to mammals was identified with the first tier for outdoor representative uses; however, the risk was assessed as low with a subsequent assessment based on the Guidance Document on Birds and Mammals (EFSA, 2009). The risk of bifenthrin to earthworm-eating birds and mammals was assessed as low for the outdoor representative uses, based on PECsoil plateau of 0.027 mg/kg. The risk to fish-eating birds and mammals was considered to be low based on the BCF value for fish of 1709. Since bifenthrin has a potential for biomagnification i.e. potential for accumulation observed in a metabolism study on rat and estimated biomagnification factor (BAF)>1, a food chain modelling has been carried out. However, the experts at the PRAPeR 87 experts' meeting identified several uncertainties in the model assumptions and parameterization and therefore they concluded that a high risk from biomagnification in the terrestrial food chain cannot be excluded. Therefore the experts agreed to identify a data gap for the applicant to further address this risk. The risk to birds and mammals for the indoor representative use in ornamentals is low since no exposure is expected. The first tier risk assessment indicated a potential high acute and long-term risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates. The estimated TER values, based on the FOCUS PECsw step 4 (20-25 m no-spray buffer zones and run-off reduction) and higher tier toxicity end points, were above the Annex VI trigger values indicating a low risk. To fulfil the data gap identified during the PRAPeR 53 to further address the risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain, a biomagnification modelling has been carried out and provided in the Additional Report. This modelling has been discussed at the PRAPeR 87. The experts agreed that a high risk from bioaccumulation through the food chain for aquatic organisms could not be excluded on the basis of the available data. Therefore, a data gap was identified to further address the risk from biomagnification in the aquatic food chain and to address the uncertainties raised. The experts concluded that a high risk was identified for bifenthrin to bees for all the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures should be applied to avoid the exposure of bees and effects from residual toxicity (by considering an appropriate interval between the last application and flowering). It could be concluded from the available information that there is a high risk to non-target arthropods for in-field and off-field areas within the treated area from the outdoor representative uses. Risk mitigation measures are required to reduce the exposure of non-target arthropods in the off-field areas. A data gap was identified for the applicant to provide further data to address the residual toxicity of bifenthrin to non-target arthropods and the potential for recovery/recolonisation. The acute and long-term risk of bifenthrin and TFP acid to earthworms was assessed as low. The risk to soil macro-organisms, micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for all the representative uses evaluated.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pepper dust extraction residue (listed in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC as pepper),2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2285,"The active substance is listed as 'pepper' in Annex I of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2229/2004 and is included as 'pepper' in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. The rapporteur Member State submitted the Draft Assessment Report on 'pepper dust'. During the peer review, EFSA concluded that the substance is the residual powder obtained after steam distillation and solvent extraction of oleoresin from black pepper and therefore the substance will be referred to as 'pepper dust extraction residue (PDER)'. Pepper dust extraction residue (PDER) is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20043, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. PDER was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'). In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/20105, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. The United Kingdom being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on PDER in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 7 January 2008. The peer review was initiated on 25 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier the Pepper Dust Task Force, and on 20 October 2010 to the Member States for consultation. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the areas of identity, physical and chemical properties and deliver its conclusions on PDER. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of PDER as a dog and cat repellent on and around all edible crops, ornamentals, garden plants and on areas not intended to bear vegetation, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. A robust specification for this substance is not available and a data gap has been identified. For the formulation the following data gaps were identified: dry sieve test, bulk density, dustability, cold temperature stability and accelerated storage. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the residue section. Considering the limited usage in terms of area and restriction to home garden use, a definition of the residue is deemed to be unnecessary for PDER. Environmental exposure (including groundwater exposure) to piperine and other potential active components in PDER are considered to be of no concern due to the localized use. The risk to non-target organisms was considered low for the representative use, providing it is restricted to home garden use. A data gap was identified for acute toxicity studies to aquatic organisms to fulfil the Annex II data requirements.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance prochloraz European Food Safety Authority,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2323,"Prochloraz is one of the 84 substances of the third stage part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002(3), as amended by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 1095/2007(4). In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the European Commission, the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by Ireland, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant's decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of prochloraz in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC)(5) concerning the non-inclusion of prochloraz in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicants BASF Agro B.V and Makhteshim Agan made a resubmission application for the inclusion of prochloraz in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008(6). The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Ireland, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 3 August 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicants for comments on 13 August 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 30 September 2010. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of prochloraz as a fungicide on cereals (foliar spray and seed treatment) and mushrooms, as proposed by the applicants. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. For the section identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis it was not possible to finalise the specification and data gaps were identified for prochloraz and the prochloraz copper complex. Data gaps were also identified for a fully validated method of analysis for products of animal origin, a method of analysis for the metabolite BTS 40348 in surface water, and clarification concerning co-formulants in two of the representative formulations. It was not possible to conclude whether the material used in the toxicology testing is comparable to the technical specification (both missing, see section 1) leading to a data gap and a critical area of concern. A data gap was also identified for the evaluation of the studies addressing the acute toxicity of 'Mirage 45 EC' and non-dietary exposure to prochloraz in 'Mirage 45 EC'. Based on the metabolism studies conducted on cereals, rapeseed, apple and mushroom, and considering the availability of two different analytical methods, the plant residue definition for enforcement was proposed as ""sum of prochloraz, BTS 44595 and BTS 44596, expressed as prochloraz"", and for risk assessment as ""sum of prochloraz and its metabolites containing the 2,4,6-TCP moiety, expressed as prochloraz"". On cereals, MRLs and conversion factors were proposed for the BASF dataset only. No MRLs were proposed for cereals from the trials conducted according to the GAPs defined by Makhteshim (540 g a.s./ha), as the samples were only analysed using the common moiety method, and therefore a data gap was identified to provide a full dataset where samples are analysed according to the proposed residue definitions. For animal products, residues were defined as for plants, and MRLs and conversion factors were proposed for ruminant products only. Data gaps were identified for additional information to confirm the stability of prochloraz residues in plant and animal matrices when stored frozen. No acute or chronic risks were identified for consumers. The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at the EU level for the representative uses, with the notable exception that: information is missing to confirm that the available fate and behaviour data for prochloraz are appropriate to be used to assess the copper complex and zinc complex variants of prochloraz, and exposure assessments for the representative uses on mushrooms and cereals as foliar spray at an application rate higher than 450g prochloraz/ha were not presented in the RMS assessments. The potential for endocrine disruption effects in birds needs to be further addressed. Data gaps were also identified to further address the long-term risk to mammals and the risk to earthworm-eating mammals for the representative use as a spray on cereals at rates up to 450 g a.s./ha, and for a risk assessment for the variant zinc complex. Risk assessments for non-target species for the representative uses on cereals with dose rates above 450g a.s./ha and for the representative use on mushrooms were not presented in the RMS assessments.",NA
[Anonymous],Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metam,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2334,"Metam is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002,3 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.4 This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the European Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 September 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main notifier Taminco. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 26 November 2008 (EFSA, 2008). Following the Council Decision of 13 July 2009 (2009/562/EC) 5 concerning the non-inclusion of metam in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Taminco N.V. made a resubmission application for the inclusion of metam in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/206/2008; European Commission, 2009) as follows: the risk to consumers given the data gaps identified in the residue section and the possible impact of the relevant impurity DMTU; as a consequence, the consumers risk assessment could not be finalised; the fate and behaviour in soil and water due to inadequate information on the major metabolite MITC and impurity DMTU. As a consequence, the risk to groundwater could not be finalised; MITC is volatile and long-range transport and potential effects on the atmosphere need to be further addressed; The risk assessment of acute effects of metam and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates feeding on soil invertebrates; Further information is required to address the recovery potential of the non-target arthropods, earthworms and non-target soil macro-organisms. And concerns were identified with regard to the potential for contamination of groundwater by the major metabolite MITC in some scenarios; the risk assessment for operators and workers in greenhouses; risk to aquatic organisms. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Belgium, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report (Belgium, 2010). The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 31 August 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 14 September 2010. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 28 October 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focussed peer review in the areas of environmental fate and behaviour and ecotoxicology, and deliver its conclusions on metam. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide, fungicide, herbicide and insecticide by soil fumigation prior to the planting of carrot, lamb. s lettuce, cucumber, aubergine, pepper, potato, strawberry, tomato and grapes. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative uses. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""Metam sodium 510 g/L"", a soluble concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method such as the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. Storage stability data where the relevant impurities are analysed for was identified as a data gap. Spectra are available for the relevant impurity MITC6 and also for the relevant impurity DMTU7. As for mammalian toxicology, metam-sodium is harmful by oral ingestion and inhalation (R22 and R20 proposed). In irritation tests, metam-sodium was not irritant to eyes but was corrosive to skin, therefore R34 (""Causes burns"") was proposed. Metam-sodium is a skin sensitiser (R43 ""May cause sensitisation by skin contact"" proposed). The relevant short-term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, rats and mice, respectively. In particular, the occurrence of severe hepatotoxicity in dogs was considered to support the proposal of R48/22 ("" Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed"") to the European Chemicals Agency (EChA). Metam did not show any genotoxic potential, but caused angiosarcomas in mice, therefore R40 (""Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect"") was proposed. The relevant longterm NOAEL was 1.5 mg/kg bw/day based on reduced bodyweight gain, specific lesion within the nasal passages, and changes in some haematology and spleen (haemosiderin depots) parameters in rats. In multigeneration tests, the relevant parental, reproductive and offspring NOAELs were 4, 12 and 4 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, metam-sodium caused an increased incidence of variations and retardations at maternally toxic dose in rats and decreased number of live foetuses, and increased number of dead implants in rabbits, with relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats of 5 mg/kg bw/day and of 5 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, in rabbits. The malformations occurred at low incidences (sometimes in singularity), but in a consistent manner, at the top-doses, in the presence of quite severe maternal toxicity. Effects were clearly treatment related and associated with maternal toxicity: the classification as R63 (""Possible risk of harm to the unborn child"") was proposed for consideration to the EChA. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study NOAEL with a Safety Factor (SF) 100; the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw based on an overall rat developmental toxicity NOAEL and supported by rabbit developmental study (SF 100). MITC is toxic via ingestion (R25 proposed) and via inhalation (R23 proposed). It is harmful in contact with skin (R21 proposed). In skin irritation tests it was corrosive (R34 proposed). It was also irritative to the respiratory system (R37 proposed). It is a skin sensitiser (R43 proposed). The relevant NOAEL for short-term exposure to MITC is 0.4 mg/kg bw/day, based on body weight decrease, haematological findings and blood chemistry at 2 mg/kg bw/day (in the 90d dog study). MITC did not show any genotoxic, carcinogenic, reproductive or developmental toxicity potential. The relevant NOAEL for long-term toxicity is 0.44 mg/kg bw/day based on haematological changes in rats; the relevant parental NOAEL is 0.7 mg/kg bw/day, the reproductive and offspring NOAEL is >3.6 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental toxicity NOAELs in rats are 3 and 10 mg/kg bw/day. The ADI and AOEL are 0.004 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1 year and 90-day studies in dog, respectively; the ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on a NOAEL for rat maternal toxicity with SF 100. The operator exposure in open field is below the AOEL with the use of Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE); the bystander exposure for applications in the open field is below the AOEL and worker exposure for applications in the open field is below the AOEL without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The operator exposure for drip irrigation in greenhouses is 2.9% of the AOEL with the use of RPE. The worker exposure is below the AOEL even without RPE 18 days after application. Bystander exposure exceeds the AOEL 10 hours after application within 12 metres of the greenhouse. The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered the impurity DMTU as relevant. Metabolism studies were supplied but no metabolites were identified. It was noted that the majority of the metabolism studies were under dosed. The meeting of experts considered the under dosing and lack of identification and it was concluded that as long as fate and behaviour had not identified any significant metabolites in soil then the metabolism data could be accepted. In the resubmission, the evaluation performed in the area of fate and behaviour confirmed that no other significant metabolites (other than MITC) are present and therefore the metabolism data are acceptable. In the resubmission the residue trials data set was completed and it can be concluded that the uses do not lead to residues > 0.01 mg/kg. It can be concluded that there is no need for processing studies, rotational crop studies or livestock studies. The risk assessment can be finalised and MRLs are proposed for all representative crops at 0.01* mg/kg. Degradation of metam and its known active metabolite MITC in soil was investigated in four soils under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. The experts in the meeting were not confident that these experiments provided a realistic representation of the fate and behaviour of metam and MITC in soil mainly due to the mode of application used in the study with respect to the application in field where volatilisation is minimized by compacting soil or with plastic films. However, the meeting noted that a number of scientific studies investigating the persistence of metam and MITC are available in the public domain and to regulatory authorities. Consequently, in the original review a data gap was identified to address the range of half-lives available for metam and MITC and whether they are applicable to the metam EU risk assessment. In the resubmission dossier the applicant presented a number of studies from the scientific literature. Available scientific literature allows a relationship between the concentration of MITC in soil and its rate of degradation to be established. MITC degrades slowly at higher concentration rates. Whereas the GLP study available in the original dossier (Hall, 2004; summarized in the DAR of Belgium, 2010) was considered scientifically acceptable, it was performed with a MITC concentration in the low range of the ones that would result from the representative uses proposed for metam. It was agreed that only the use in potato (153 kg metam /ha) could be considered covered by the end points derived from this study. A new data gap was identified to address those situations where the soil concentrations of the metabolite MITC due to the use of metam are expected to be significantly higher than the concentration used in the available GLP study. Taking into consideration the application rates of metam other than for the use on grape (306 -612 kg /ha), during the peer review it was considered that impurities need to be addressed for the potential environmental and ground water contamination. The notifier submitted an overview of the main impurities present in the technical material that was summarized by the RMS in the addendum (Belgium, 2008). The meeting of experts in toxicology agreed that the impurity DMTU should be regarded as toxicologically relevant and therefore a data gap was identified in the original review for a ground water exposure assessment. The route and rate of degradation of the relevant impurity DMTU in four soils under aerobic conditions was investigated in one study submitted with the resubmission dossier. DMTU may be considered to have very low persistence in soil. PEC soil for metam and MITC were calculated for the worst case use other than grape, in field tomato (612 kg a. s. /ha) assuming 15 cm incorporation. Time dependent PEC soil need to be updated once the data gaps identified for persistence in soil are solved. Initial PECs in soil may be used for the EU risk assessment. Mobility of metam was investigated by the HPLC method. According this experiment metam may be considered to be very highly mobile in soil. In the original review a batch adsorption /desorption study was available for MITC in four soils. This compound was very high mobile in these soils (Kfoc = 27 mL/g). The meeting of experts concluded that adsorption in the study may have been overestimated due to the fact that experimental Koc values are simultaneously affected by degradation and volatilisation during the experiment. A new study is available in the resubmission dossier that investigates adsorption /desorption of MITC in five soils. The very high mobility of MITC is confirmed by these experiments (KFOC = 9-20.2 mL /g). In the original review a new data gap was identified by EFSA to address the mobility of the impurity DMTU in soil in order to obtain adequate input parameters for ground water modelling. According to the new study available in the resubmission dossier it may be expected that DMTU will exhibit very high mobility in soil (KFOC = 7-10 mL /g). Hydrolysis of metam is relatively fast at any pH. Hydrolysis of MITC at 25 C occurs with half-lives of 40 d (pH 4), 50 d (pH 7) and 11 d (pH 9). Major hydrolysis products of MITC were DMU, DMTU and MDTA (metam). The fact that one of the major metabolites of MITC is metam indicates that in water metam and MITC are in equilibrium. Aqueous photolysis of metam under simulated sunlight is very fast (DT50 = 12 min; equivalent to 27.8 min at 38 N). No acceptable ready biodegradation study is available and therefore the substance is considered to be not readily biodegradable. In the aerobic water/sediment experiment (25 C) metam degrades rapidly in the whole system (DT50(whole system) = 0.32 h). The meeting agreed that the information provided by the notifier did not allow any quantitative estimation of the effect of temperature on the volatilisation. Consequently, in the original review the meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the effect of temperature on the dissipation of MITC from water by volatilisation. In the resubmission dossier a theoretical calculation on the dependence of volatilisation on the temperature is presented. According to this calculation volatilisation rates are about half at 12 degrees C than at 25 degrees C but it is still expected that DissT50 would be shorter than 1 d. No new water sediment study at lower temperature was provided in the resubmission. The data from the anaerobic water sediment study were considered not relevant for the representative uses and it was not found scientifically justified to average dissipation rates from aerobic and anaerobic experiments Due to the data gaps identified on the derivation of various key modelling input parameters and to the fact that FOCUS SW modelling does not consider volatilisation-deposition route of entry in surface water, the available PECSW were not considered appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The meeting of experts in the original review identified a data gap for worst case PECSW estimations of MITC taking into consideration short range transport and deposition to surface water bodies and potential exposure via drainage with adequate input parameters. In the resubmission new calculations of PEC SW for the active metabolite MITC have been provided. FOCUS SW Step 3 calculations presented in this reassessment may be used as a worst case in the aquatic risk assessment; however, FOCUS SW Step 4 calculations provided do not follow FOCUS Landscape recommendations. Additionally the applicant has provided an estimation of the PEC SW resulting from volatilisation deposition of MITC. Without further mitigation, the exposure of the aquatic environment resulting from this route can be considered covered by the assessment performed for the edge-of-field exposure. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate MITC PECGW values with adequate input parameters (when available) using FOCUS GW or a higher tier approach if appropriate. In the resubmission dossier new PEC GW calculations were provided for MITC. However, the persistence end point available for this substance was considered by the peer review to represent only situations where the substance is applied at lower application rates such as the representative use in potato (153 kg metam /ha; equivalent to 86.6 kg MITC/ha). Potential groundwater contamination was assessed for the use in potato assuming rotation and applications once every third year. With these restrictions the limit of 0.1 g/L is exceeded in 5 of the 9 scenarios simulated. Additionally the 10 g/L are exceeded in two of the scenarios with a calculated maximum of 197.73 g MITC /L in Jokioinen (PELMO 3.2.2 calculation). In the original review, a new data gap was identified by EFSA to address the potential ground water contamination of impurity DMTU. In the resubmission dossier, potential groundwater contamination by the impurity DMTU has been addressed. DMTU did not exceed the trigger of 0.1 g/L for any of the scenarios and uses simulated. The meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the atmospheric fate and behaviour of MITC including global warming (ozone depletion), long-range transport and deposition. In the resubmission dossier, experimental values have been provided by the applicant showing that half-lives in the atmosphere, when all possible degradation processes are considered (direct and oxidative indirect photolysis), will be in the range of 4.8-6.3 d. This half life is still longer than the 2 d trigger considered for alerting on potential long-range transport. Therefore, the critical area of concern on potential long-range transport of MITC through the atmosphere remains. The available data suggest that MITC might have a low potential for ozone depletion. The potential for contribution to global warming of MITC has not been directly addressed within the information provided in the resubmission dossier. In practice, any meaningful global warming assessment would need to consider the overall amount of MITC released to the atmosphere (including sources other than metam) and an assessment restricted to the European geographical region might have limited relevance in this context. The notifier and the RMS proposed in the DAR that due to the method of application of metamsodium, the risk to birds and mammals was considered acceptable for the representative field uses. Member States experts suggested that the most probable contaminated food items for birds and mammals would be the soil invertebrates (including earthworms). The experts in the PRAPeR 53 meeting agreed that the notifier should provide an acute risk assessment to assess the effects of metam-sodium and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates feeding on soil invertebrates. The acute risk assessment should also be provided for the metabolite MITC using the lowest endpoint available of 100 mg a. s./kg bw, which was agreed during the meeting. A higher tier assessment of the risk of MITC to insectivorous and vermivorous birds and mammals was carried out, based on the higher tier studies in the resubmission dossier. Birds and mammals censuses were performed on sterilized and unsterilized carrot plots in France to derive focal species and ecological data. The study was deemed valid only for the identification of focal species. In a second field study, residues in invertebrates and in carrots were measured. It was agreed to use the highest residue as RUD (13.3 mg/kg). Overall, it was concluded that the risk of metam-sodium and MITC to birds and mammals was assessed as high, for all the field representative uses, with the exception of the use on potato. Therefore a data gap has been identified to further address the risk for insectivorous and vermivorous birds, for all field representative uses except on potato. Metam-sodium and its relevant metabolite MITC were very toxic to aquatic organisms based on the available data. Due to the rapid degradation of metam-sodium in soil, surface water contamination with the parent molecule could be excluded. Aquatic organisms may be exposed to the metabolite MITC as result of the drainage and run-off. The fate and behaviour section considered that PECsw from FOCUSsw step 3 can be considered valid only for the representative use on potato, but not for the other representative uses. The PECsw values from FOCUSsw Step 4 were not considered valid in the fate and behaviour section. The TERs values were calculated on the basis of new PECsw values from FOCUS step 3. The TERs values were above the Annex VI trigger values for most of the FOCUSsw step 3 scenarios for the representative use on potato, indicating a low risk of MITC to aquatic organisms for the representative use on potato. For the representative field uses evaluated other than the use on potato, a data gap was identified to assess the risk of MITC to aquatic organisms based on the new PECsw. An extended laboratory study was conducted with Aleochara bilineata and this aged residue study demonstrated that A. bilineata was able to recolonise the field after 55 days. From an extended laboratory study it was only possible to assess the potential for re-colonisation, but not the actual recovery. A field trial was presented in the resubmission dossier. The field trial was carried out to determine the effects of metam-sodium on the non-target arthropods of arable land in France after one application in spring. The test demonstrates that actual recovery in the field occurred for the most important taxa within one year. For 2 % of pitfall sampling taxa recovery was still ongoing in the next spring. Due to the high mortalities of arthropods found in the in-field area, probably the recolonisation may occur from non-treated field. Therefore the risk of MITC to non-target arthropods was considered to be low. An earthworm field study was conducted with the metam-sodium. The experts agreed that after the application of the 608.4 kg a. s./ha, there was no clear indication of full recovery after one year. A further refinement was required from the notifier to address concerns on recovery/recolonisation of earthworms this should be include considerations on effects on recovery of different ecological groups as well as known data on migration distances. Information on the migration distances of earthworm species was submitted in the resubmission dossier. However, available data on migratory distances could not be used in the risk assessment. Therefore a data gap remains. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to other soil macro-organisms was assessed. A field trial to demonstrate the effects of metam-sodium on non-target macro-organisms on arable land in France a after one application in spring was submitted in the resubmission dossier. All affected soil-dwelling in vertebrates had recovery in abundance within the same season and no adverse effects extended into the year after the treatment. Therefore the risk of metam-sodium and MITC to soil macro-organisms was assessed as low for all of the representative uses. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to bees, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the field uses. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees, nontarget arthropods, soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed to be low for the representative greenhouse uses.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clethodim,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2417,"Clethodim is one of the 79 substances of the third stage part A of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20024, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20075. In accordance with the Regulation, at the request of the European Commission, the EFSA organised a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by The Netherlands, being the designated rapporteur Member State (RMS). The peer review process was subsequently terminated following the applicant. s decision, in accordance with Article 11e, to withdraw support for the inclusion of clethodim in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the Commission Decision of 5 December 2008 (2008/934/EC) 6 concerning the noninclusion of clethodim in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant Arysta LifeScience made a resubmission application for the inclusion of clethodim in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/20087. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the DAR. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, The Netherlands, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 1 December 2009. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States and the applicant for comments on 3 December 2009. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 18 January 2010. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report, the comments received, and where necessary the DAR, the European Commission requested the EFSA to conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology, residues and environmental fate and behaviour, and deliver its conclusions on clethodim. The conclusions arising from the peer review were subsequently laid down in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 10 September 2010, EFSA Journal 2010; 8(9): 1771. Clethodim was included in Annex I of Directive 91/414 by Commission Directive 2011/21/EU of 2 March 20118, and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20099, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/201110, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/201111. A specific provision was included that Member States may only authorise uses as a herbicide on sugar beet. In March 2011 the European Commission received a request to modify the restriction in Part A of the approval directive of clethodim, based on the evaluation of new toxicological and residues data carried out by the Netherlands (RMS) following the submission of data by Arysta LifeScience. Subsequently, the RMS invited all Member States and EFSA to provide comments on the outcome of the evaluation of the new data. Additionally, the RMS submitted to the European Commission an updated addendum of the DAR for the section on residues. Following consideration of the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to organize a peer review of the new evaluation and to deliver its updated conclusions on clethodim. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of clethodim as a herbicide on sugar beet, as proposed by the applicant. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. A data gap is identified with regard to the formulation in the section physical and chemical properties. No critical areas of concern are identified in the mammalian toxicology section. A data gap is identified for an assessment of the toxicological relevance of some groundwater metabolites. Based on the plant metabolism studies conducted on soybean, cotton and carrot, the residue definition for monitoring was proposed as ""sum of clethodim, clethodim sulfoxide and clethodim sulfone expressed as clethodim"" for the root/tuber and oilseeds/pulses crop groups. Based on the representative use on sugar beet the residue levels in food of animal origin are not expected to exceed 0.01 mg/kg and therefore, no residue definitions and no MRLs were proposed for animal products. The uses of clethodim in sugar beet are not considered to result in a risk to the consumer, as the maximum TMDI was calculated to be less than 2 % of the ADI. An additional intake by consumers through drinking water derived from groundwater was considered with regard to the metabolite clethodim sulfone (1.09 mu g/L) and was shown to be negligible (0.1 % of the ADI for infants). The data available on environmental fate and behaviour are sufficient to carry out the required environmental exposure assessments at EU level for the representative uses, with the notable exception for experimental degradation rates in soil and soil adsorption values for the two soil photolysis metabolites 2-[ 3-chloroallyloxyimino] butanoic acid and trans-3-chloroacrylic acid to address the soil and groundwater exposure assessments of the two photodegradates. A data gap is also identified for the characterisation of the chromatographic peak M20 found in a soil metabolism study in order to support the exclusion of the content of this peak from the overall quantification of metabolite clethodim oxazole sulfoxide. In case this fraction is part (one of the isomers) of clethodim oxazole sulfoxide and the quantitative determination makes the metabolite occur at more than 5 % at two consecutive time points, then a groundwater assessment would be needed. The potential for groundwater exposure by the metabolites clethodim sulfone and clethodim oxazole sulfone is predicted to be high over some geoclimatic conditions represented by the FOCUS groundwater scenarios. On the basis of the available mammalian toxicology data, the metabolites clethodim sulfone and clethodim oxazole sulfone were considered to be toxicologically non-relevant. The risk for earthworm-eating birds and mammals was assessed as high at first tier for soils with pH < 5.5, indicating the need for further refinement, therefore a data gap has been identified and the issue has been indicated as a critical area of concern. The long-term risk for insectivorous birds was assessed as high after a refinement for the southern European use of 384 g a.s./ha, and therefore a data gap was identified. Clethodim technical is toxic to aquatic organisms. Based on the data for the formulation, a high risk was identified for the majority of scenarios at FOCUS step 3 for all the representative uses. The TER values are expected to still be below the Annex VI trigger at FOCUS step 4 in the majority of scenarios, with a no-spray buffer zone up to 30m, for the southern European use of 384 g a.s./ha. Data to further refine the risk are needed. At FOCUS step 4 the risk was low with a no-spray buffer zone up to 18 m for the southern European use of 2x192 g a.s./ha, except for the R3 stream scenario. For the northern European use of 300 g a.s./ha, the risk was assessed as low with a no-spray buffer zone up to 30m, except for the D3-ditch and R3-stream scenarios. The risk for the other representative uses (1x240 g a.s./ha, 1x180 g a.s./ha, 1x192 g a.s./ha) was assessed as low with FOCUS step 4 PECsw, provided the application of no-spray buffer zones up to 25 30m. The risk was assessed as low for bees, non-target arthropods, soil macro- and micro-organisms, non-target terrestrial plants, and biological methods of sewage treatment.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance blood meal,2011,EFSA JOURNAL,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2394,"Blood meal is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/ 2007(4). Blood meal was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24bof the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009(5), in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(6), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011(7).

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on blood meal in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 3 November 2006. The peer review was initiated on 12 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier Gyllebo Godning AB and on 16 December 2010 to the Member States for consultation. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on blood meal. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of blood meal as a repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry, orchard trees and ornamental plants, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the section for identity, physical, chemical and technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for a specification with supporting data, solubility in water, shelf-life, evidence that the formulation can form a useable solution and a method of analysis for the formulation. No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. The fate and behaviour in the environment of blood meal residues is expected to follow the normal pathways of dissipation and degradation common to naturally occurring residues of biological origin. Considering the nature of the substance and most methods of application leading to negligible levels of environmental exposure, further consideration of its fate and behaviour in the environment was concluded to be unnecessary, with the exception of when application is made by less targeted spray application methods such as air-assisted broadcast spraying. In this situation the environmental exposure assessment to aquatic systems was not finalised. A data gap was identified in the ecotoxicology section for the mandatory toxicity studies with aquatic organisms (acute toxicity test for fish, acute toxicity test for aquatic invertebrates and chronic study for algae) to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. In addition, due to a missing aquatic exposure assessment when less targeted spray application methods are employed, the risk assessment for aquatic organisms was not finalised.",NA

Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on potassium hydrogen carbonate in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 2 May 2006. The peer review was initiated on 16 May 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the original notifier Brotherton Speciality Products Limited (the notifier subsequently changed and is now Church & Dwight UK Ltd). Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on potassium hydrogen carbonate. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of potassium hydrogen carbonate as a fungicide on apple and grapevines, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps were identified for the section on physical and chemical properties of the formulation. No critical areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the toxicology section. Metabolism and residue studies were considered not necessary and not relevant for the evaluation, due to the nature and properties of the active substance. The setting of MRLs for potassium hydrogen carbonate associated with its use as a plant protection product is considered not necessary and a quantitative consumer risk assessment was not conducted. Potassium hydrogen carbonate is a naturally occurring inorganic compound that dissociates to K+ and HCO3- in the presence of water. A data gap has been identified for studies or peer reviewed scientific literature to support the naturally occurring levels of potassium proposed by the notifier. Based on the limited data set available, the risk to birds and to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low for the representative uses. Several data gaps were identified in relation to the assessments for non-target terrestrial vertebrates, for aquatic organisms, for honeybees, for non-target arthropods, for soil non-target organisms and for terrestrial non-target plants. Based on the available data, a high risk for honeybees was identified as a critical area of concern",NA

The peer review was initiated on 31 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the notifiers the Forestry Commission and Phytophyl -N.G. Stavrakis. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on urea. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of urea as a fungicide treatment by spray and drenching to individual conifer tree stumps, as a spot spray attractant with an insecticide to olive trees, and as a mass trapping agent in liquid traps in olive groves, as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for Annex II and III physchem data packages, a method of analysis for urea and the impurity biuret in the technical material. Also validated methods of analysis for urea in the formulations were identified as data gaps. In the mammalian toxicology section the toxicological database is not suitable to set an AOEL and therefore the risk assessment for non-dietary exposure cannot be concluded. No data gaps or critical areas of concern were identified in the residue section. The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of urea in relation to the representative uses as a spray in olive trees and to conifer stumps was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. Data gaps were identified for satisfactory information on adsorption to soil of urea or its transformation products, for predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) in soil for urea, PEC in surface water/sediment for urea, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite, and PEC in groundwater for urea, nitrate and nitrite. No data gaps were identified for the representative uses by drench application of individual stumps by hand, or as a mass trapping agent in liquid traps. Based on the estimated atmospheric half-life performed by EFSA with US EPA AOPWIN program (v1.92), urea has a potential for long-range transport through the atmosphere. A data gap was identified for studies on aquatic organisms to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. A data gap was also identified for the original studies summarised in the US EPA and OECD reports and the IUCLID database. Finally, a data gap was identified to address the risk to non-target organisms for the representative spray uses to conifer stumps and olive trees once the environmental exposure is finalised.",NA

Several data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section: to demonstrate the compliance of the batches used in the toxicological studies to the technical specifications (leading to an issue that could not be finalised) and to assess the toxicological relevance of impurities. A data gap was identified in the residue section for the submission of information on the natural background level of gibberellins in grapes. MRLs were not proposed as residue levels in treated and control samples were below the LOQ and since it would not be possible to distinguish between exogenous and natural gibberellins. The information available on the environmental fate and behaviour in the environment was insufficient to assess the environmental exposure levels of potential transformation products of gibberellic acid. Consequently the potential for groundwater exposure by gibberellic acid transformation products and the risk assessments to aquatic and soil-dwelling organisms from transformation products could not be finalised. A data gap was identified to address the risk to aquatic macrophytes, chronic risk to fish and aquatic invertebrates, risk to non-target arthropods and earthworms from exposure to gibberellic acid. Furthermore, the representativeness of the material tested in the ecotoxicological studies to the technical specification should be addressed, leading to a data gap. A low acute risk from exposure to gibberellic acid was concluded for aquatic organisms. A low risk was concluded for mammals, bees, soil micro-organisms and biological methods of sewage treatment processes.",NA

Data gaps were identified in the residue section for the submission of information on the natural background levels of gibberellins in the edible parts of crops and for storage stability studies. No MRLs were proposed for pome fruits as the residue levels in both treated and control samples were below the LOQ and since it would not be possible to distinguish between exogenous and natural occurring gibberellins. With the available information (pertinent to the assessment of environmental fate and behaviour in soil and water), a high potential for groundwater exposure of the active compounds GA(4) and GA(7) above the parametric legal limit of 0.1 mu g/L over a wide range of geoclimatic conditions was identified from all the representative uses assessed.

In the areas of identity of the micro-organism, biological properties, physical and technical properties and methods of analysis, the following data gaps remain: data on contaminating micro-organisms, pathogens and toxins, a method to unequivocally identify the micro-organism down to strain level, various other methods, storage stability data for the formulations and various physical and chemical properties of the formulation. In the area of mammalian toxicology, no critical area of concern and no data gap were identified. However, the production of toxins cannot be excluded and therefore the risk assessment cannot be finalised for humans. For the time being no critical area of concern is identified however, as the issue of toxins is not fully addressed for sections 1 and 2, the consumer risk assessment remains open for the edible crops. Data available on fate and behaviour in soil show that Metarhizium anisopliae may be very high persistent at concentrations considerably higher than background natural conditions (after one single application it is estimated that it will take more than 10 years for levels to decline down to the upper background level). Data gaps have been identified to establish the accumulated plateau after repeated applications over the years and to address the persistence and multiplication of the fungi and the conidia in water. A critical area of concern has been identified with respect to the persistence and spread of the micro-organism in the environment. A data gap has been identified in the identity section to exclude the presence of swainsonine, destruxins and cytochalasin toxins by the notified strain of Metarhizium anisopliae. Depending on the outcome of the data gaps that have been identified in sections 1 and 5 to exclude the presence of swainsonine, destruxins and cytochalasin as toxins of Metarhizium anisopliae further information may be needed to assess the production and the fate and behaviour of these toxins in the environment. The data available on ecotoxicology were not sufficient to carry out the required risk assessments for non-target organisms. Data gaps were identified for birds and mammals, aquatic organisms, pollinators, non-target arthropods, earthworms and soil non-target micro-organisms. The risk characterization for wild mammals, honey bees, earthworms and non-target soil micro-organisms for the representative uses, could not be finalised. The risk for epizootic infections within the wide range of host species including beneficial arthropods was identified as a critical area of concern.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diphenylamine,2012,EFSA JOURNAL,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2486,"Diphenylamine is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme coveredby Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20023 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007.4 This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) upon request of the European Commission to organise a peer review of the initial evaluation, i. e. the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within 6 months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the European Commission. Ireland being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on diphenylamine in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 20 June 2007. The peer review was initiated on 8 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the applicants Cerexagri s. a. and Pace International. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the applicant upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in May June 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in September 2008 leading to the conclusions set out in the EFSA Conclusion issued on 30 September 2008 in the EFSA Scientific Report (2008) 188. Following the Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 (2009/859/EC) 5 concerning the noninclusion of diphenylamine in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance, the applicant, the European Diphenylamine Task Force made a resubmission application for the inclusion of diphenylamine in Annex I in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008. The resubmission dossier included further data in response to the issues identified in the conclusions leading to the Decision on non-inclusion, as set out in the Review Report (SANCO/191/08) as follows: The information available is insufficient to satisfy the requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III Directive 91/414/EEC in particular with regard to: the risk to consumers. And concerns were identified with regard to the lack of data on the levels and toxicity of unidentified metabolites of the substance; the possible formation of nitrosamines during storage of the active substance and during processing of treated apples; the lack of data on the potential breakdown or reaction product of diphenylamine residues in processed commodities; the lack of data to finalise the specification. In accordance with Article 18 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, Ireland, being the designated RMS, submitted an evaluation of the additional data in the format of an Additional Report. The Additional Report was received by the EFSA on 3 December 2010. In accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 33/2008, the EFSA distributed the Additional Report to Member States on 13 December 2010 and the applicant on 11 January 2011, for comments. The EFSA collated and forwarded all comments received to the European Commission on 24 February 2011. In accordance with Article 20, following consideration of the Additional Report and the comments received, the European Commission requested the EFSA to deliver its conclusions on diphenylamine. The conclusion from the original review was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use as a plant growth regulator as proposed by the applicant. It is applied as a postharvest drench to apples before they go into storage. The conclusion of the peer review of the resubmission was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the same representative use. Full details of the representative use can be found in Appendix A. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was ""No Scald DPA 31"", an emulsifiable concentrate (EC). Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition, except for surface water and products of animal origin. Residues in food of plant origin can be determined with a multi-method (the German S19 method has been validated). For the other matrices only single methods are available to determine residues of diphenylamine. A data gap is identified for a method of analysis for products of animal origin and for surface water. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. In the mammalian metabolism studies, diphenylamine was rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, it underwent extensive metabolism to sulphonyl and glucuronyl conjugates and was rapidly excreted mainly via urine. Acute oral and dermal toxicity were low; it was not technically feasible to perform an acute toxicity study by inhalation. Diphenylamine was not a skin irritant, but can cause severe irritation to the eyes; therefore, classification with Xi ""irritant"" and risk phrase R41 ""risk of serious damage to eyes"" was proposed. According to a Magnusson and Kligman test, diphenylamine was not a skin sensitizer. The red blood system was the target organ of diphenylamine in rats, mice and dogs, upon short-term and long-term exposure, as evidenced by altered haematological parameters, splenic erythropoiesis, splenic congestion and haemosiderosis. Additionally, histopathological changes in the liver and kidneys were found upon longer exposure. The relevant short-term NOAEL of 9.6 -10 mg/kg bw/day (optimised light conditions) and is moderately volatile. Indirect photooxidation in the atmosphere through reaction with hydroxyl radicals was also estimated. However it was concluded that despite these limited data, as a consequence of the applied for intended use of diphenylamine, this information was sufficient to characterise the environmental risk at the EU level as exposure of soil, surface water and sediment and consequently groundwater would be expected to be negligible. Though diphenylamine is moderately volatile, significant concentrations in air would not be expected as this property will be counteracted by its moderate water solubility. Diphenylamine would not be expected to have the potential for long range atmospheric transport due to its expected potential for indirect photochemical oxidative degradation in the atmosphere. The submitted data suggest a low acute and short-term toxicity of diphenylamine to birds and a low acute toxicity to mammals. Exposure of birds and mammals from the representative use as an indoor drench treatment of apples is considered unlikely. Diphenylamine is very toxic to aquatic organisms. However exposure of aquatic organisms is considered to be negligible. Management measures tailored to local practice and legislation should be put in place to control the waste disposal of spent application solution and prevent accidental spillage entering sewers or surface water drains. No data were made available for other non-target organisms. However exposure of non-target organisms is assumed to be unlikely if the product is applied according to the GAP and studies are considered not necessary. The risk to biological methods of sewage treatment was assessed as low.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance methyl nonyl ketone,2012,EFSA JOURNAL,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2495,"Methyl nonyl ketone is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/20043, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/20074. Methyl nonyl ketone was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 1 September 2009 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation'), and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/20095, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/20116, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/20117. In accordance with Article 25a of the Regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 114/20108, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to deliver by 31 December 2012 its view on the draft review report submitted by the European Commission in accordance with Article 25(1) of the Regulation. This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on methyl nonyl ketone in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 18 September 2006. The peer review was initiated on 12 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the original notifier Pet and Gardening Manufacturing Ltd (the notifier is now Spotless Punch Ltd). Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on methyl nonyl ketone. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of methyl nonyl ketone as an animal repellent for the protection of home garden and amenity grass, ornamentals and vegetable patches, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Numerous data gaps have been identified for the physical and chemical properties of the active substance and the formulation. The technical specification for this compound is open because the 5batch analysis was not conducted according to GLP. Data gaps for methods for the technical material, formulation, soil, water and air have been identified. A critical area of concern was identified for methyl nonyl ketone in the mammalian toxicology section, as it was not possible to assess the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification (both missing). Based on the outcome of the vapour pressure study (data gap identified by physical chemical properties section), an acute inhalation toxicity study might be required. No significant residues in plant or animal matrices were expected based on the representative use, and a quantitative consumer risk assessment is therefore not required. The information on the environmental fate and behaviour of methyl nonyl ketone in relation to the representative uses assessed was insufficient to complete the necessary environmental exposure assessment at the EU level. The fate and behaviour in soil and natural sediment water systems has not been addressed. Consequently the environmental exposure assessment for soil, surface water and groundwater for any transformation products that might be formed from methyl nonyl ketone could not be finalised. A data gap was also identified for the adsorption/desorption properties of the active substance, and therefore the available predicted environmental concentrations in surface water can not be considered valid. Because of the lack of relevant end points for methyl nonyl ketone the groundwater exposure assessment could not be finalised. A critical area of concern was identified for methyl nonyl ketone in the ecotoxicology section, as it was not possible to assess the compliance of the batches tested with the proposed specification (both missing). A data gap was identified to provide acute toxicity studies for fish to fulfil the Annex II data requirements. Data gaps were also identified for a new risk assessment for aquatic organisms, and to further address the risk to soil-living organisms (i. e. earthworms, other soil macro-and microorganisms, soil non-target arthropods).",NA

Hungary being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on sodium aluminium silicate in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 31 March 2008. The peer review was initiated on 31 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier Fluegel GmbH and on 20 October 2010 to the Member States for consultation and comments. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on sodium aluminium silicate. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of sodium aluminium silicate as a game repellent on deciduous and coniferous trees in forestry and trees in orchards, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. The identity and specification for sodium aluminium silicate could not be concluded on and a data gap has been identified. Data gaps are also identified for storage stability data and a method of analysis for the active substance in the formulation. Based on the representative uses no areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section. Sodium aluminium silicate is used as a game repellent, which is applied only as a protective coating to the outside of tree trunks, and therefore no residues in food or feed occur. A quantitative consumer risk assessment is therefore not necessary. Sodium aluminium silicate is a natural mineral of volcanic origin (pumice stone). Sodium aluminium silicate is known to be insoluble, photolytically stable and inert even to mineral acids and bases. Considering the nature of the substance and the limited usage a definition of residue in the environment for risk assessment is deemed to be unnecessary for sodium aluminium silicate. The risk to non-target organisms from the representative use of sodium aluminium silicate was considered to be low.",NA

For the formulations low temperature stability, dilution stability before and after accelerated storage, and shelf-life studies were identified as data gaps. Data gaps were identified in the mammalian toxicology section regarding information on the uses allowing to waive toxicological studies for the species Macrocystis integrifolia, and for medical data on the three species Ascophyllum nodosum, Laminaria digitata and Macrocystis integrifolia. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the residue section. No areas of concern or data gaps were identified in the environmental fate and behaviour section. The risk to birds and mammals and to aquatic organisms was assessed as low. However, a data gap was identified for further data and risk assessment for algae from an additional taxonomic group and for aquatic plants. Moreover, it was noted that the composition of the batches of the formulations used in the aquatic tests did not comply with the representative batches. A data gap was also identified for a risk assessment for honeybees referring to one of the representative uses where exposure of bees could occur. Further data gaps were identified for non-target arthropods, earthworms, soil macro-and microorganisms and terrestrial non-target plants.

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Denmark being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted a DAR on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strain ABTS 351) a DAR on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strain PB 54) and a DAR on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strain SA 11, SA 12, EG 2348) in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which were received by the EFSA on 4 February 2008. The peer review was initiated on 19 April 2008 by dispatching the DAR on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strain PB 54) for consultation of the notifier (Probelte S. A.) and the DARs on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strains ABTS 351, SA 11, SA 12, EG 2348) on 22 April 2008 for consultation of the notifiers (Mitsui AgriScience International S. A./B. V. and Valent BioScience). Subsequently the DARs were dispatched to the Member States on 11 June 2008. Following consideration of the comments received on the DARs, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a peer review and deliver its conclusions on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strains ABTS 351, PB 54, SA 11, SA 12, EG 2348 and deliver its conclusions on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (strains ABTS 351, PB 54, SA 11, SA 12, EG 2348 The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of as an insecticide grapes, tomatoes and cabbage as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity of the micro-organism/biological properties/physical and technical properties and methods of analysis the main data gaps are related to toxin formation, contaminating microorganisms and methods of analysis both for identification and quantification. In the area of mammalian toxicology the risk assessment cannot be finalised for operators, workers and bystanders, due to the lack of data on toxin formation. Three data gaps were identified: the test material used in the toxicology studies for the two formulations with the strain SA-11 has to be checked for its compliance to the formulations containing SA-12 and EG-2348, the acute inhalation toxicity of the WP product containing strain EG-2348 has to be addressed, and the acute oral and inhalative toxicity of the WP product with PB-54 has also to be addressed. For residues the risk assessment cannot be finalised as the possible formation of enterotoxins cannot be excluded. No information has been provided in relation to potential interferences of Bacillus thuringiensis with the analytical systems for the control of the quality of drinking water provided for in Directive 98/83/EC. No information has been provided on the potential transfer of genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis to other organisms. Data or assessment to demonstrate that this transfer does not occur or in case of occurring will not lead to unacceptable effects on human and animal health, and on the environment has to be provided. No studies on persistence and multiplication in soil and aquatic environment of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strains PB54, ABTS-351, SA-11, SA-12 and EG-2348 are available. Available data suggest that spores may remain in soil from months to years under field conditions. An estimation of background levels of spores and the time needed to recover after application of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki is currently not available. Crystalline proteins (delta endotoxins) are produced at the time of sporulation. They are exogenous metabolites of Bacillus thuringiensis with insecticide activity. No studies on the route and rate of degradation in soil. mobility in soil and degradation in water and water sediment of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strains PB54, ABTS-351, SA-11, SA-12 and EG-2348 crystalline proteins are available. Worst case estimations of soil and water half-lives and soil adsorption would be needed to finalise the environment exposure assessment of these proteins. During the peer review a data gap was identified for the groundwater exposure assessment for the crystal protein and conversion products that retain any insecticidal activity. Data gaps were identified for strains PB-54 SA-12: 1) to provide specific studies on Daphnia magna. due to the uncertainties on the extrapolation from other strains or alternatively a robust argumentation would be needed to support the extrapolation from other Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki strains data.; 2) to provide a justification whether or not extrapolation on arthropod effect data from other strains is appropriate. A data gap was also identified to provide the papers mentioned in the addendum on the acute toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki to Lepidoptera, used to address the off-crop risk to non-target Lepidoptera population.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance hydrolysed proteins,2012,EFSA JOURNAL,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2545,"Hydrolysed proteins is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4). Hydrolysed proteins was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on 18 December 2008 pursuant to Article 24b of the Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulation' and has subsequently been deemed to be approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009(5), in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(6), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 541/2011(7).

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Greece being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on hydrolysed proteins in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 24 April 2008. The peer review was initiated on 31 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the notifiers (BIOIBERICA, S. A.; PHYTOPYL - N.G. STAVRAKIS; SICIT 2000 S.p.A.). The commenting period with Member States was launched on 16 December 2010. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that there was no need to conduct an expert consultation and EFSA should deliver its conclusions on hydrolysed proteins. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of hydrolysed proteins as an insect attractant on deciduous fruit trees and walnut, olive, citrus, kiwi and blueberries, as proposed by the notifiers. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. For the section identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis specifications and Annex II data packages were not available for these compounds. Several data gaps were identified for the formulated products. Hydrolysed proteins per se are likely to be of low toxicological concern and no risks to human health could be expected from the use as a plant protection product. However due to the fact that a specification to include the main components in the active substance is still outstanding, a final conclusion cannot be drawn whether the technical specification is of toxicological concern and whether data waivers can be accepted and reference values are needed; therefore, a data gap and issues that cannot be finalised were identified. According to the representative uses, it is not excluded that the edible parts of the treated crops and/or their by-products destined for animal consumption will be in contact with the hydrolysed proteins from their use as an ""insect attractant"". Nevertheless, these active substances are likely to be of low toxicity and a quantitative consumer risk assessment can be waived unless the required technical specification (see section 1) raises a toxicological concern. A data gap may be required to reconsider the consumer risk assessment through dietary intake and drinking water pending the outcome of the outstanding data on the specification and on the groundwater exposure assessment. Information to complete an adequate environmental exposure assessment is not available. The environmental exposure assessment could not be finalised. No toxicity studies for non-target organisms were submitted in the section ecotoxicology. Studies on aquatic organisms that are necessary to fulfil the Annex II requirements are identified as a data gap. The specification of the active substances is outstanding and the environmental exposure assessments could not be finalised. Pending on the outcome of these issues, in particular, whether the exposure to the environment arising from the representative uses will be greater than the natural background level, the risk assessment for all non-target organisms, with the exception of those involved in biological methods for sewage treatment plants needs to be addressed. a data gap was identified.",NA
NA,Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance extract from tea tree,2012,EFSA JOURNAL,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2542,"Extract from tea tree is one of the 295 substances of the fourth stage of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004(3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007(4).

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Latvia being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on extract from tea tree in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 25 October 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the notifier (SIA 'Biomor Latvija'; the new notifier from 04/2010 is 'Biomor Europe Ltd.'). Subsequently the DAR was dispatched for consultation of the Member States on 24 February 2011. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on extract from tea tree. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of extract from tea tree as a fungicide on potatoes, carrots, herbs, cucumber, watermelons, tomatoes, pepper and ornamentals as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis data gaps were identified for validation data for the method used in the GLP batch study and spectra for the marker compounds and methods of analysis for appropriate marker compounds in environmental compartments. Data gaps for the formulation were identified for accelerated and shelf life storage studies and flash point. Data gaps were identified for investigation of the in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation potential of extract from tea tree, providing sufficient toxicological information to allow the derivation of reference values, ADI, ARfD and AOEL. The composition of the batches used in the toxicological studies should be presented, as well as an assessment of the toxicological relevance of impurities and components of the tea tree mixture. As no AOEL could be derived, no conclusion could be reached on the operator, worker and bystander exposure risk assessment. Considering the complete lack of data on toxicokinetic and metabolism, short-term, long-term, reproductive and developmental toxicity, a critical area of concern was identified. There is no conclusion in the residues area. The nature of residues in plants is unknown and a critical area of concern is identified. Data gaps have been identified for information to address the route and rate of degradation of extract from tea tree components in soil, surface water and sediment. More specific data gaps for disappearance time (DT) values in soil of the components: tirpenene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and 1,8cineole and consequent FOCUS groundwater exposure modelling for these components were also identified along with the need for FOCUS surface water assessments for all extract from tea tree components consequent to the representative uses outdoors in the field. The data gaps lead to the conclusion that the groundwater exposure assessment for tirpenene-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and 1,8cineole was not finalised, that the soil, groundwater and aquatic exposure assessments from potential soil or aquatic system transformation products of globulol and viridiflorol (should they be formed) could not be finalised and that the aquatic exposure assessment for all 12 components of extract from tea tree could not be finalised for the representative outdoor field uses. The data available for the ecotoxicological assessments were insufficient. The risk assessments for birds and mammals, honeybees and other non-target arthropods, earthworms and non-target soil macro and micro-organisms and for the potential effects on the biological methods of sewage treatment could not be finalised.",NA

Hungary being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aluminium silicate in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 31 March 2008. The peer review was initiated on 22 July 2008 by dispatching the DAR to the notifier Tessenderlo Chemie NV and on 20 October 2010 to the Member States for consultation and comments. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on aluminium silicate. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of aluminium silicate as an insect repellent on pear trees and vines, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. There is an outstanding data gap for a finalised and supported specification as well as data gaps for a method of analysis and a shelf life study. An area of concern was identified for aluminium silicate in the mammalian toxicology section as it was not possible to assess either the compliance of the batches tested or the representativeness of the test substance used for deriving the occupational exposure limit to the proposed specification (both unavailable). Aluminium silicate is an inert substance. No residues are expected on pears as the fruit is not present at application and aluminium silicate is not taken up by plants. For grapes the maximum theoretical residue given the application rate will not exceed the amount allowed as a food additive. This is very much a worst case assumption and in reality when the grapes are consumed it is highly unlikely that there will be any significant residue of aluminium silicate. Aluminium silicate is a stable inorganic compound. Its chemical composition is similar to common clay. Once released it is expected to be stable in the environment and undistinguishable from clay minerals naturally present in soil. The risk to non-target organisms from the representative use of aluminium silicate was considered to be low. A data gap was however identified for algal toxicity.",NA

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Portugal being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on aluminium ammonium sulfate in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 10 July 2008. The peer review was initiated on 16 December 2010 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and on 7 August 2008 to the notifier Sphere Laboratories Ltd. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the area of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on aluminium ammonium sulfate. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of aluminium ammonium sulfate as a repellent in agriculture, horticulture, amenity areas and for amateur use, as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. Data gaps were identified in the section identity, physical and chemical properties and analytical methods. In the mammalian toxicology section, a data gap was identified for the lack of exposure estimates and risk assessment for the representative uses as seed dressing ('Curb Powder Formulation') and animal repellent in slug pellet formulation ('Curb Liquid Formulation'). A data gap was identified for the residues section to provide experimental data addressing the residue levels of aluminium ion in relevant representative crops (row crops, combinable crops, grassland) receiving foliar spray application at the worst case conditions (overall treatment, least favourable soil conditions, maximum seasonal application rate, latest growth stage at application). Only for uses as slug pellet formulations, as a seed treatment and as a barrier or spot trunk treatment of tree crops it can be reasonably assumed that aluminium residues resulting from the application of aluminium ammonium sulfate will be insignificant, and only provided treatment of fruit trees is conducted in a manner that precludes any contamination of the fruits. For all the other uses it is currently not possible to conclude without further data that the use of aluminium ammonium sulfate would not present a risk to consumers. Concerning the environmental fate and behaviour, data gaps were identified to address the impact of the concentrations of transformation/dissociation products of aluminium ammonium sulfate in soil and surface water that arise from the use of aluminium ammonium sulfate. This is in the context of comparison to their background levels in the different environmental compartments, occurring naturally or from anthropogenic origin. These data gaps result in the environmental exposure/risk assessment being not finalised. Data gaps were identified for satisfactory information on mobility of the transformation/dissociation products of aluminium ammonium sulfate in soil, for predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) in surface water/sediment for aluminium ions and sulfate, and PEC in groundwater for the transformation/dissociation products of aluminium ammonium sulfate. A simplistic calculation performed by EFSA based on the worst case assumptions showed that there is a potential for the Drinking Water Directive requirement(9) for the chemical parameter for aluminium (200 mu g/L) to be exceeded. Some relevant information on the GAPs of the representative uses is inadequately reported to properly identify the worst case scenario (combination of crop, application rate, number of applications, timing, etc.) for the risk assessment. Information on the natural buffering capacity of surface water bodies in Europe to neutralize ammonia/ammonium and/or sulfate inputs potentially formed following the use of aluminium ammonium sulfate and on the possible adverse effects on aquatic organisms is required. The risk assessment to non-target organisms cannot be concluded with the available data, with the exception of birds, mammals, non-target terrestrial plants and organisms involved in biological methods for sewage treatment plants.",NA

Since they represent the product as it is finally brought to market they have a high commercial and patent value. Comprehensive search and retrieval of chemical formulations both in patent and non-patent literature builds the basis of a successful reinforcement of patent protection, avoidance of infringement of third party patent rights and competitive analysis.

Specific guidance is provided for basic assessments but not for refined assessments, where specialised expertise is required to select methods appropriate to the assessment in hand. The guidance includes probabilistic methods for quantifying some of the major sources of variability and uncertainty affecting dietary exposure to pesticides. Other important sources of variability and uncertainty might be quantified probabilistically in refined assessments but are addressed more simply in basic assessments by conducting alternative model runs with optimistic and pessimistic assumptions. Guidance is provided on problem formulation, including definition of appropriate scenarios for acute and chronic exposure assessment in the differing contexts of approval of new substances, MRL setting, authorisation of products, evaluation of residues found above the MRL, and annual reviews of residue monitoring data. Detailed guidance is provided on methodology for probabilistic modelling of acute and chronic exposures and for quantifying variability and uncertainty in food consumption and residues. For basic probabilistic assessments, optimistic and pessimistic assumptions are used for the effects of processing and for residues below the level of reporting. A separate section is devoted to additional approaches required for modelling exposure to multiple substances (cumulative assessment): the use of relative potency factors to cumulate exposures to different substances, and a basic methodology for addressing gaps in data on the co-occurrence of residues of different substances. Specific guidance is provided on the types and formats of outputs that should be produced from a probabilistic assessment. Particular emphasis is placed on characterising the upper tail of the exposure distribution and on 'drill down' techniques to evaluate the reliability of the estimates. A general approach is recommended for evaluating uncertainties affecting the model outputs. An appendix to the guidance describes uncertainties associated with the methodology recommended in this guidance, and provides a general evaluation of their potential impacts on estimated exposures. The guidance also includes a checklist of key issues to be considered when writing or peer-reviewing reports on probabilistic exposure assessments, a discussion of approaches to validating probabilistic assessment approaches, and a list of desirable characteristics of software for probabilistic exposure modelling. Some comments are provided on the interpretation of results, while recognising that risk management is outside the remit of EFSA. Case studies are included in an appendix, illustrating some but not all of the recommended approaches. Further work will be required to make the methods in this guidance available to end-users in more practical form, including software and more specific user instructions. Some recommendations on this are provided. (C) European Food Safety Authority, 2012.",NA

This review report was established as a result of the initial evaluation provided by the designated rapporteur Member State in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR). The EFSA therefore organised a peer review of the DAR. The conclusions of the peer review are set out in this report. Sweden being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on spearmint oil in accordance with the provisions of Article 22(1) of the Regulation, which was received by the EFSA on 9 November 2007. The peer review was initiated on 18 June 2008 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the notifier (XEDA International). Subsequently the DAR was dispatched for consultation of the Member States on 24 February 2011. Following consideration of the comments received on the DAR, it was concluded that EFSA should conduct a focused peer review in the areas of mammalian toxicology and deliver its conclusions on spearmint oil. The conclusions laid down in this report were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of spearmint oil as a plant growth regulator on potatoes as proposed by the notifier. Full details of the representative uses can be found in Appendix A to this report. In the area of identity, physical/chemical/technical properties and methods of analysis a data gap was identified for an Annex II data package for the active components that make up spearmint oil. Data gaps for the formulation are auto-flammability, accelerated storage and shelf life. No methods of analysis were available for products of plant and animal origin and for soil, water and air. In the mammalian toxicology area data gaps were identified for the definition of the toxicological profile of spearmint oil; the database was insufficient to set reference values and the risk assessment is inconclusive. In the residues section it was concluded that significant levels of residues of (R)-carvone will occur in potatoes upon application of spearmint oil according to the proposed use scenario. However, several data gaps were identified and a final residue definition for risk assessment and monitoring could not be derived. Furthermore, in absence of agreed toxicological reference values a consumer risk assessment could not be performed. The environmental fate and behaviour section of the dossier was empty. Consequently 4 data gaps have been identified. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) approaches have been used to obtain more uncertain than usual input parameters to carry out groundwater exposure modelling for the main constituent of spearmint oil. When the uncertainty in the use of the QSAR approach is included in the modelling strategy, these modelling results indicate a high potential for groundwater contamination by the pesticide active substance carvone, consequent to the representative use assessed, in the situation when treated potatoes are used as seed potatoes. The data set for the ecotoxicological assessments was not sufficient, therefore the risk assessments for non-target organisms could not be finalised.",NA

The conventional formulation does not only increase the loss of pesticide but also leads to environmental pollution. Controlled-release formulations of pesticide are highly desirable not only for attaining the most effective utilization of the pesticide, but also for reducing environmental pollution. Pesticide imidacloprid was incorporated in poly (styrene-diacetone crylamide)-based formulation to obtain controlled release properties, and the imidacloprid nanocontrolled release formulation was characterized by infrared (IR) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Factors related to loading efficiency, swelling and release behaviors of the formulation were investigated. It showed that the loading efficiency could reach about 40% (w/w). The values for the diffusion exponent ""n"" were in the range of 0.31-0.58, which indicated that the release of imidacloprid was diffusion-controlled. The time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, T-50, was also calculated for the comparison of formulations in different conditions. The results showed that the formulation with higher temperature and more diacetone crylamide had lower value of T-50, which means a quicker release of the active ingredient. This study highlighted some pieces of evidence that improved pesticide incorporation and slower release were linked to potential interactions between the pesticide and the polymer.",NA

This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.

However, this industry is threatened by numerous pests; one of the most harmful being the acarus known as ""red spider mite"" or Tetranychus urticae. Dangerous, synthetic pesticides are used in order to control this mite. Our research was carried out in the flower farm of ""La Juliana"" (north Andean zone of Ecuador, 00 degrees 03'00 '' N and 78 degrees 12'00 '', 2840 mamsl). Its objective was to evaluate the acaricidal properties of three essential oils: coriander (Coriandrum sativum), basil (Ocimum basilicum), and thyme (Thymus vulgaris), against the Tetranychus urticae mite. The effects of the acaricide test were measured 24 and 48 hours after applying the essential oils, and the results were compared through non-parametric analysis. The effective concentration for Ocimum basilicum was of 1.60%, for Thymus vulgaris was of 1.60% and for Coriandrum sativum, 3.12%. Furthermore, each concentration was compared to the research control ""ethanol"" group and a synthetic pesticide mixture used regularly by the flower farm technicians. After 24 hours, the thyme essential oil showed the best acaricidal effects, after 24 and 48 hours high effectiveness was observed for the thyme and basil essential oils. Finally, a natural product was formulated whose active ingredient was the thyme essential oil and compared to the Abamectin-Tetradifon synthetic blend, showing a similar acaricidal effect.",NA

In nature however, plants would have been extinct; but plants produce compounds with toxicity to a wide variety of potential herbivores (Bush et al., 1997). Plants under attack release a cocktail of volatile compounds that act as cues for these allies, which then attack, consume and reduce the populations of herbivores (De Moraes et al., 1998). The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the feeding and anti-feeding effects of Azadirachta indica, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium and Quassia amara extracts (Azadirachtin, Pyrethrin and Quassin, respectively) and their mixtures on diamondback moth larvae. Larvae were fed with cabbage leaf disks treated with the various extracts. Mortality and leaf area consumed by larvae were recorded after 24 h of larval exposure to the treated leaves. Results revealed varying level of feeding and anti-feedant effects among all the formulations. Formulations with the highest concentration resulted in an increased feeding and anti-feedant effect in terms of larval mortality and feeding area. The most effective anti-feedant effect was recorded by the Pyrethrin, and Azadirachtin + Pyrethrin mixture (with a 1.0% feeding area each), followed by Azadirachtin + Pyrethrin + Quassin mixture and Pyrethrin + Quassin mixture with 2 and 3% feeding area, respectively.

Biological control agents (BCAs) have been recently used trying to replace or employed together with the chemicals applied in the pre- and postharvest phase. Thus, a wide characterization of the biological control agents (BCAs) in terms of their growth at different temperatures and pHs and in presence of fungicides are previous and necessary steps in establishing the viability of BCAs. Therefore, two strains belonging to B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum (I3 and I5) have been studied. Firstly, temperature, pH and compatibility with six broadly active substances included in commonly used fungicides were determined in vitro followed by an in vivo growth study in peaches (pH 5.2) at room (20 degrees C) and cool (4 and 10 degrees C) temperatures. Then, the efficacy against M. fructicola and M. laxa in 'Calante' peaches was also conducted by wound and spray inoculation. The results showed that the BCAs were mesophilic (30-37 degrees C) and not tolerant to acidity (pH>5) but that they can survive at pH<5 and 20 degrees C by forming spores and can germinate when the conditions are suitable for their multiplication. Active substances such as iprodione and diethyl dithiocarbonate required 4-fold dilution whilst tebuconazole needed half concentration, comparing to reference doses. Otherwise, phthalimide, fenhexamid and methylthiophanate allowed a proper BCAs growth at their reference doses. All the BCAs were able to grow in peaches at 20 degrees C and their populations remained stable at cool temperatures. No incidence of brown rot in wounded and treated peaches were detected after 2 days at 20 degrees C and it was significantly reduced after 5 days. These results show the great efficacy of I3 and I5 against brown rot in peaches by reducing significantly the incidence of the disease. This efficacy added to the compatibility with fungicides will allow a future pre- and postharvest application.",NA

Effluent from starch industry is rich in carbon and nitrogen and can replace expensive feedstock used during the fermentation process. Objectives The main objective of this study was to achieve a biopesticide formulation from starch industry wastewater (SIW) with high entomotoxicity (UI/ml) of larvae comparable to Foray 76B, which is a commercial biopesticide. Methods Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki HD1 (Btk) strain was cultivated and sub-cultured to aerobic, anaerobic digested effluent and SIW. Pre-treatment was carried on these different substrates to enhance the residual carbon required for Btk growth and delta endotoxin synthesis. After 48 hours of fermentation, cells count and delta-endotoxin were determined. A biopesticide formulation containing fermented broth and adjuvants was fed to larvae to determine larvae mortality. Results Btk cell growth and sporulation profile in SIW media displayed a high total cell count and viable spores compared to btk growth in anaerobic or aerobic media after 48h fermentation. The maximum endotoxin concentration in the SIW medium was 435 mu g/mL, whereas, in anaerobic and aerobic effluent, the maximum concentrations were at 161 mu g/mL and 136 mu g/mL, respectively. When acidic treatment was performed at pH 2 for these substrates, entomotoxicity obtained from aerobic and anaerobic biopesticide formulations displayed significantly higher entomoxicity than the untreated ones. The entomotoxicity of SIW treated at pH 2 was equivalent to the standard Foray 76B which is 20,000 IU/mu L. Conclusion Anaerobic and aerobic effluent did not contain enough total organic carbon to augment Btk growth and entomotoxicity. Substrates pre-treated at pH 2 provided significant organic matter for Btk growth and resulted in larval mortality equivalent to the com ercial biopesticide Foray 76B.",NA

Its status as an agricultural pest is exacerbated by its outstanding potential to evolve resistance to pesticides. The existence of multiresistant mite populations challenges mite management and creates a need for the development of pesticides with novel modes of action. In this study, we evaluated the acaricidal activity of Neo-Boost, a pesticide registered as a bactericide/fungicide/insecticide/miticide. Neo-Boost formulation contains three active ingredients: potassium silicate, sodium percarbonate and tetraacetylethylenediamine. In contact with water, the latter ingredients generate peroxyacetic acid, a potent contact bactericide and fungicide. Using the recommended field dose, we tested contact and residual effects of Neo-Boost on T. urticae egg, larval, and adult life stages. We found that Neo-Boost had no ovicidal effect. When tested on larvae, Neo-Boost caused 87% mortality over 48 hours post-treatment that was comparable to the positive control AGRI-mek SC (active ingredient abamectin), in addition to delaying larval developmental progression. On adult mites, Neo-Boost acted as a deterrent and caused 35% mortality (an intermediate effect compared to the positive control AGRI-mek SC). We also tested the proposed ability of Neo-Boost to induce a systemic response, however, it had no priming effect on treated tomato plants against mites. Of the individual Neo-Boost components tested, peroxyacetic acid and potassium silicate were not effective in any assay. However, sodium percarbonate, surfactant, and other non-listed components were sufficient for the full effectiveness of Neo-Boost formulations. Additionally, phytotoxicity of Neo-Boost was rare and minor when it occurred. Overall, despite the inefficiency of some compounds, the Neo-Boost formulation, either in its original or simplified formulation, may be useful for mite control on crops that are destined for fresh human consumption or medicinal use.",NA

Thus, there is a critical need to develop diversified chemical control tools in the post-harvest supply chain for these two species. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a novel insecticide formulation, containing the insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, combined with the pyrethroid, deltamethrin and the synergist piperonyl butoxide (Central Life Science, Schaumberg, IL, US), compared to the existing commercial standard formulation without synergist, and controls at inducing direct mortality and sublethal changes in movement on treated grains as a grain protectant, and on concrete as a surface treatment. Mortality of adults was assessed visually, while movement was tracked with a network camera coupled with Ethovision software that automatically recorded velocity and distance moved by both species, after continuous exposure on treated material for 4-168 h. The novel formulation significantly induced mortality while reducing distance and velocity moved by multiple-fold compared to controls for exposed adults even after relatively brief exposure periods. In fact, the novel formulation was just as effective as the older formulation, but used only a fraction of the active ingredients, thus it may be more cost-effective.

So, the current research was planned to explore the prospective of Mentha piperita to be used for the formulation of larvicides against mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The ethanolic and water extracts of M. piperita leaves were prepared using the soxhlet apparatus. The extracts were dried and subjected to prepare five concentrations multiple of 80 ppm. Each concentration was applied for its larvicidal efficacy setting an experiment (in triplicate) in plastic containers of 1000 ml with extracts, 30 larvae of all four instars separately, and fed with dog biscuits along with controls. Observations were taken after each 12 hrs. till 72 hrs. The antioxidant perspective of M. piperita was determined by DPPH radical scavenging, total antioxidant capacity, and ferric reducing power assays. Using brine shrimp lethality bioactivity, the cytotoxic study was perceived. Standard techniques were used to classify the M. piperita extract using preliminary qualitative and quantitative phytochemicals, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and GC-MS analysis. M. piperita ethanolic leaves extract after 24 hrs. of exposure in 400 ppm showed 93% (LC50 = 208.976 ppm) mortality in ethanolic extract and 80% (LC90 = 246.900 ppm) in the water extract.

Authorized herbicidal active ingredients (AIs) have been combined in multiple ways to produce distinct commercial formulations targeting diverse weeds. However, interactions between AIs and co-formulants can result in unpredictable outcomes. In addition, the efficacy against target weeds of application rates much lower than those commercially recommended has been reported. In this context, the present work intends to assess the possibility of optimizing the combination of AIs within a commercial formulation of bentazone and terbuthylazine towards alternatives with decreased environmental hazardous potential, by considering both the mixture composition and application rates. The putative interaction between bentazone and terbuthylazine (AIs), as formulated within a commercial product and in alternative ratios and rates, was assessed, first, by testing with selected aquatic (Raphidocelis subcapitata) and terrestrial (Brassica napus) non-target sensitive indicators for environmental safety assessment, and then, by assessing the corresponding efficacy against a major target weed (Portulaca oleracea). Results showed that (i) commercially recommended rates represent a remarkable potential risk to soil and also aquatic ecosystems; (ii) application rates 10-fold lower than recommended are effective in the control of the main target weed; and (iii) a one-way formulation including only bentazone, which is already available on the market, seems to represent an environmentally safer alternative to the two-way formulation in the control of P. oleracea. These outcomes suggest that a more systematic assessment of the ecotoxicity, as well as the efficacy, of the combinations of pesticides used in commercial products during design stages could ensure a good performance of the agrochemicals against the targets, while improving their environmental safety regarding impacts in non-target organisms.

Their actual toxicity depends on a number of factors, like the species in focus or the developmental stage of exposed individuals. As ectothermic species, the metabolism of amphibians is influenced by ambient temperature. Therefore, temperature also affects metabolic rates and thus processes that might enhance or reduce toxic effects. Studies about the interactive effect of temperature and toxicity on amphibians are rare and deliver contrasting results. To investigate the temperature-dependent pesticide sensitivity of larvae of two European species we conducted acute toxicity tests for the viticultural fungicide Folpan (R) 500 SC with the active ingredient folpet at different temperatures (6 degrees C, 11 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 26 degrees C). Sensitivity of Rana temporaria and Bufotes viridis was highly affected by temperature: early larvae (Gosner stage 20) were about twice more sensitive to Folpan (R) 500 SC at 6 degrees C compared to 21 degrees C. Next to temperature, species and developmental stage of larvae had an effect on sensitivity. The most sensitive individuals (early stages of R. temporaria at 6 degrees C) were 14.5 times more sensitive than the least sensitive ones (early stages of B. viridis at 26 degrees C). Our results raise concerns about typical ecotoxicological studies with amphibians that are often conducted at temperatures between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. We suggest that future test designs should be performed at temperatures that reflect the temperature range amphibians are exposed to in their natural habitats. Variations in the sensitivity due to temperature should also be considered as an uncertainty factor in upcoming environmental risk assessments for amphibians.",NA

We assessed changes in malaria incidence over an additional 21 months, corresponding to a change in IRS formulations using clothianidin with and without deltamethrin. Using enhanced health facility surveillance data, our objectives were to 1) estimate the impact of IRS on monthly malaria case counts at five surveillance sites over a 6.75 year period, and 2) compare monthly case counts at five facilities receiving IRS to ten facilities in neighboring districts not receiving IRS. For both objectives, we specified mixed effects negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for surveillance site adjusting for rainfall, season, care-seeking, and malaria diagnostic. Following the implementation of IRS, cases were 84% lower in years 4-5 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 0.16, 95% CI 0.12-0.22), 43% lower in year 6 (aIRR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.44-0.74), and 39% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.97-1.97) compared to pre-IRS levels.

We observed a resurgence in malaria to pre-IRS levels despite sustained IRS. The timing of this resurgence corresponded to a change of active ingredient.

Kinetic, isothermal and thermodynamic tests were performed in both materials using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, accelerated surface area and porosimetry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda pore size and volume analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Adsorption equilibrium occurred in 60 min with an adsorption capacity of 0.58 mg.g(-1) (22.3%) for BC and 1.49 mg.g(-1) (53.2%) for BCox, with the latter showing a higher adsorption rate in the initial stage, reaching a 44% removal in the first 5 min, while in the case of BC, the removal was 5%. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model better adjusted to both adsorbents, although in the case of oxidized biochar, the Avrami model suggested that adsorption can also occur according to the pseudo-second-order model. Experimental data fitted in Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms revealed a more accurate fitting with the Freundlich model. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the adsorption of glyphosate was an endothermic and nonspontaneous phenomenon in this study. Acid oxidation with H3PO4 produced smaller pores and caused the collapse of the porous structure of the adsorbent. The results also showed that although acid oxidation enhanced the adsorption of commercial glyphosate, the values were con-sidered low when compared with those obtained for pure compounds presented in the literature.",NA

In this work, zein was used to modify mesoporous silica as nanocarriers to load avermectin to obtain the nanopesticides. Due to the unique properties of zein, the nanopesticides were responsive to pH and enzyme. The pesticide release at alkaline condition was controlled by the electrostatic repulsion between zein and pesticide, while the controlled release of pesticide in the presence of enzyme was due to the cleavage of peptide bond in zein, and the relevant release mechanisms were also elucidated. Besides, these nanopesticides exhibited a high pesticide loading capacity above 280 mg g(-1), and such nanocarriers reduced the degradation rate of the pesticide against ultraviolet irradiation about 55%. Also, these nanopesticides demonstrated enhanced wetting and adhesion properties on cucumber foliar surfaces, and they show comparable pesticidal efficacy with the pure pesticide. Therefore, this work provides a facile and environmentally friendly strategy to prepare a dual responsive nanopesticide system, and the controlled release performance, high pesticide loading capacity, enhanced photostability, remarkable pesticidal efficacy, and improved wetting and adhesion properties of the resultant nanopesticides make them potential for agricultural applications.",NA

Various inorganic and organic oils also were used for bed bug management. However, there are no published studies on their toxicities against bed bugs. In this study, we screened 18 essential oils, three silicone oils, and paraffin oil (C5-20 paraffins) for their toxicities against bed bugs.

Vast amounts of wastewater containing hazardous substances (e.g., pesticides, dyes, heavy metals, and drugs) are produced via multiple industrial processes. A majority of them are discharged into water endangering human health. Hence, the main aim of this chapter was to highlight the threat that is carried by pesticides, dyes, heavy metals, and drugs and present diverse methods for their removal. Exposure to these pollutants can lead to severe illnesses such as various types of cancer (e.g., lung, bladder, colorectal, liver), tumors, central nervous system disorders, dysfunctions of organs (e.g., liver, kidneys), allergies, asthma, or irritation of skin and eyes. Moreover, some of these contaminants are known to exhibit genotoxic or mutagenic activity toward the human organism. Therefore, it is very important to effectively remove harmful compounds from the environment. Numerous methods including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, immobilization techniques, ion exchange, membrane separation, coagulation, or flocculation are used for this purpose; however, adsorption is found to be the most beneficial. Thus, searching for novel adsorbents and developing the methods mentioned above can significantly improve the state of the environment and diminish the risk of dangerous human diseases. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

One reason for the failing risk assessment may be strong differences in the toxicity of the active ingredient of pesticides and their commercial formulations. Sublethal effects, especially those on behaviour, have been largely ignored in this context, yet can be equally important as lethal effects at the population and ecosystem levels. Here, we compared the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on survival, but also on ecologically relevant sublethal traits (life history, behaviour and physiology) in damselfly larvae. Roundup was more toxic than glyphosate with negative effects on survival, behaviour and most of the physiological traits being present at lower concentrations (food intake, escape swimming speed) or even only present (survival, sugar and total energy content and muscle mass) following Roundup exposure. This confirms the toxicity of the surfactant POEA. Notably, also glyphosate was not harmless: a realistic concentration of 2 mg/l resulted in reduced growth rate, escape swimming speed and fat content. Our results therefore indicate that the toxicity of Roundup cannot be fully attributed to its surfactant, thereby suggesting that also the new generation of glyphosate-based herbicides with other mixtures of surfactants likely will have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological studies comparing the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations typically ignore behaviour while the here observed differential effects on behaviour likely will negatively impact damselfly populations. Our data highlight that risk assessment of pesticides ignoring sublethal effects may contribute to the negative effects of pesticides on aquatic biodiversity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA

The chemical management of pests can affect non-target organisms, including honey bees. Risk assessment is a way to evaluate the cost-benefit of pesticide use to honey bees and involves understanding the exposure routes and hazards posed by each particular pesticide. The effects of insecticides on bees are intuitively recognized, but other types of pesticides can affect honey bees too. Even ""inactive"" ingredients in a pesticide formulation can pose a risk to bees. Bees encounter pesticides as they forage in the environment through direct exposure to pesticide applications, and through contaminated resources such as pollen, nectar, water, comb, and propolis. Pesticides can affect bees in myriad ways. The toxicity of pesticides is highly context-specific, challenging risk assessments. Mortality is the most commonly measured effect of pesticides on bees but sublethal effects range from developmental problems, reduced reproductive fitness, diminished overwintering capacity, and numerous behavioral issues that may not kill the bee outright, but may kill the hives. The pervasiveness of pesticides in the environment means that bees cannot avoid exposure to numerous chemicals. Selecting for bees that are adapted to agrichemical-intensive landscapes may be a short-term solution, but the dynamic evolution of chemical use may prohibit long-term tolerances. Beekeepers and farmers need to work together to create and promote reduced chemical intensive food production systems. This is the only long-term answer for the survival of honey bees and biodiversity in general. Broad scale simplification of the landscape accompanied the rise of industrial-scale food production, and a variety of agrichemicals are used to support these monoculture-based systems. Biodiversity provides substantial resistance to the proliferation of pests in a variety of ways, but this diversity is removed from our food production systems in order to maximize short-term production goals. In the absence of biotic resistance to pest proliferation, land managers rely on pesticides to replace the pest management function provided by diverse biological communities. The downside is these pesticides do not solve the causative problem that produced the pest. Within this context, pests become resistant, and more and new pesticides are required to maintain pests at low densities in a system that is designed for them to excel (i.e., the pesticide treadmill). This is the environment into which honey bees and other pollinators have been inserted, and pesticides inherent in these systems affect pollinators in complex ways. Pesticides are not intended to hurt bees or any other beneficial organisms, but they often do; estimating this harm is called risk assessment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",NA

The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (~200nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (~250nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (~2200nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20μg a.i. L-1 technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",NA

The expression of cholesterol receptor (low density lipoprotein receptor), de novo cholesterol synthesis enzyme (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase), hormone-sensitive lipase, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mRNA and phosphorylated form was decreased. Adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (ACTH), melanocortin-2 receptor, expression was not changed but circulatory ACTH levels and adrenal cortex protein kinase A (PKA) activity were reduced. Surprisingly, exogenous ACTH treatment rescued steroidogenesis in Roundup®-treated animals. Apoptosis was evident at 250mg/kg bw/d, but not at 10mg/kg bw/d dose.

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-à-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro®, Roundup klasik Pro® in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit®, Roundup klasik Pro® in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital®, and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro® did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; Glyphosate herbicide formulation in a tank mix with surfactants and also surfactants alone significantly influenced the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as the glyphosate formulation alone had no effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",NA

Glyphosate is a nonselective systemic herbicide, which is commonly used for drying CC. Here we included a review of the related topics and showed the effects of drying oats and rye with glyphosate, inoculation with two plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, and nitrogen fertilization on rhizosphere microbial communities at field conditions in the western Pampas of Argentina. Rhizosphere samples were obtained at three times: Before drying the CC, a month after this, and at harvest time of soybean which was grown after each CC. Counts of viable cells and physiology of rhizosphere microbial communities were analyzed. The inclusion of CC dried with glyphosate modifies their associated rhizosphere microbial communities. Their numbers significantly decreased or increased. For some microorganisms, these changes were temporary because their amounts at soybean harvest time did not differ from those obtained when the sampling was done before drying CC with glyphosate application. Besides, our results indicate that the drying time must be chosen taking into account CC types and their phenology. This scientific information is evidence of changes on rhizosphere microbial communities due to the management of CC with glypho- sate in combination with or without both inoculation and fertilization of CC. These data are agronomic and environmentally relevant because they have shown that the type of management would impact on the quality and health of the soil and therefore in agroecosystem sustainability. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",NA

The review is about correlating the indiscriminate use of pesticides and to find out and highlight the evidences for mechanism of action of these pesticides for erectile dysfunction and find out the most used and most dangerous pesticide from erectile dysfunction point of view. The review suggests that erectile dysfunction is having a significant place as a causal factor for infertility.

Werner I.; Moran K.,Effects of pyrethroid insecticides on aquatic organisms,2008,ACS Symposium Series,991,310,334,10.1021/bk-2008-0991.ch014,"Aquatic organisms, in particular insects, crustaceans and fish, are highly sensitive to pyrethroid insecticides. Acute toxicity to fish and aquatic invertebrates is generally observed at concentrations below 1 pg/L, and sublethal effects have been reported at low ng/L concentrations. Although it is difficult to model sublethal responses to toxicants and predict ecotoxicological impact or risk, measures of sublethal effects are likely to be as important, or more important, than the measures of acute or chronic lethal effects to accurately assess the consequences of contaminant exposure. The primary mechanism of toxic action is often not the only toxic effect a chemical can exert on target and non-target species. For example, neurotoxic pesticides may impair the immune system or exhibit hormonal effects, or can alter behavior with negative effects on predator avoidance or reproductive success. Many of these chemical side effects are poorly understood or unknown. Although toxic concentrations of pyrethroids in sediments of surface waters have been reported, there is presently limited information on their temporal and spatial distribution, as well as concentrations of pyrethroids in the water column. One of the major limitations for obtaining data on the sources and quantities of pyrethroids in the environment, in particular in water samples, is the sensitivity of the existing analytical chemistry techniques. Because pyrethroids are toxic at extremely low concentrations (low to mid parts per trillion range) monitoring data that are based on insufficiently low detection limits are of little use. In fact, such data can convey a false sense of safety with regard to the potential toxic effects of pyrethroid contamination on aquatic ecosystems, especially if multiple pyrethroids are present simultaneously. Due to their relatively short half-lives and hydrophobic nature, pyrethroid concentrations in larger water bodies are expected to be generally ephemeral, especially in the water column. Higher toxicity and reduced degradation rates at low temperatures may render pyrethroids a greater risk to aquatic life during the winter period, which-along with winter rains and associated stormwater runoff -has the potential to make winter applications of pyrethroids more important environmentally than summer applications. Critical data gaps on pyrethroids exist. To provide much needed information the following questions should be answered in future work: How do sublethal toxic effects affect the ecological fitness of organisms and populations? - Do pyrethroids interact with other stressors or chemical contaminants to induce toxicity? - What are the effects of inert ingredients in pyrethroid formulations on toxicity and environmental fate and transport?. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",NA

Such an increase in testing efficiency is necessary to address the lack of toxicity information on the large chemical inventories that present potential human and environmental exposure scenarios, as well as to provide sufficient coverage of chemical and biological space to enable effective modeling of toxicity. Utilizing high-throughput screening methods developed in the drug discovery community, this in vitro-based approach focuses on the mechanisms of chemico-biological interactions by using large chemical libraries to probe key molecular targets and signaling pathways. Computational toxicology has emerged as a critical component in handling the large and complex datasets required for developing and validating this approach. Insight into these interactions will greatly enhance our understanding of the molecular and biological basis of toxicity and result in greater confidence in extrapolations, as well as factors critical to risk assessment such as significant susceptibility factors, subpopulations at risk, and influences on the shape of the dose-response curve. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The biodiesel program is based on three ""fundamental pillars"": social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic viability. The majority of the nation's biodiesel is derived from soy, which raises problems for both social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Soy has been implicated in destruction of Amazon and Cerrado biomes. However, as the world's second largest soybean producer, Brazil's soy complex serves multiple domestic and international markets. The tremendous expansion of soy largely predated the introduction of biodiesel. The cultivated area grew much more rapidly in the five years prior to the policy than in the five years after its implementation, possibly driven more by demand for soymeal than for oil used to make biodiesel. Thus, attribution of environmental impacts is unclear. Further, while the policy of social inclusion requires that a portion of feedstock be sourced from small farmers, the industry's dependence on soy makes this questionable. Soy tends to be planted in large and heavily mechanized monoculture plantations that are not amenable to smallholder inclusion. Efforts to introduce alternative crops deemed more environmentally or socially sustainable, like Jatropha curcas, castor, oil palm, and some native palms, have not gained much momentum and they have seen little utilization as biodiesel feedstocks. This chapter examines the implications of dependence on soy for the sustainability of Brazil's biodiesel industry and discusses the prospects for larger volumes of alternative feedstocks to be introduced. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

The survey revealed that cardamom had consumed 26.59 kg a.i ha-1 in comparison with tea (8.70kg a.i ha-1). Pesticide intensity of cardamom (0.0322 kg kg-1) was higher than tea (0.0046 kg kg-1). Risk weighed active ingredients values were 3.326 and 0.029 kg ha-1 for cardamom and tea respectively. The pesticide use intensity in major cardamom growing areas of the CHR has experienced significant increase from 2002 and 2003. It was 7.10 kg a.i ha-1 in the year 2002 and decreased slightly to 5.42 kg a.i ha-1 for the year 2003. The number of pesticide sprays has been increased during the last two years (2011-2012). Pesticide residues in soils of all three cardamom growing hot spots were high. Hospital data of these cardamom hot spot regions showed higher levels of pesticide poisonings particularly for organophosphorous compounds. Therefore, the analysis and results reported here on pesticide consumption by cardamom and tea must be taken seriously to safeguard the degraded rainforest cardamom agroforestry system.

A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common 'inert' ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated. © 2014 Zhu et al.",NA

For this, mice were exposed from 23 days of age (PND) until PND 45 to glyphosate (50 mg/kg, per os) or saline solution, and, ten days after the end of treatments, male and female mice were observed in the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) or forced swimming test (FWT). Results showed that exposure to glyphosate: 1) reduced the locomotion frequency of male mice similarly to female mice in the OF and female mice had an increase in rearing behavior and in the immobility time; 2) reduced in male mice the motor activity both in the OF and EPM, while no effects were observed in female mice; 3) in the SWT male mice had a decreased time of float similarly female mice. We concluded that pre-pubertal exposure to glyphosate reduced in male mice the capacity of exploration in the OF and EPM tests suggesting that the herbicide interfered with the central mechanism related to brain masculinization of exploratory and anxiety behavioral models.

This is the first report of its kind. Subjects and methods: This was an observational and retrospective study performed with data from 2001 to 2007 from the National Register of Hospital Admissions/Discharges from the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas y Censos, and also with data from the Ministry of Public Health. Ecuador does not have an official public medical poisoning registry or disease-specific registries. Results: The complete register reported 44,931 cases of poisoning with an average of 6,418 cases per year and a global progressive increase of 2,123 cases in the entire period. It reported 14,145 cases of pesticide poisoning. Of these, 10,100 cases were due to the effects of the insecticides organophospate and carbamate. The number of cases by gender was 7,102 (50.21%) males and 7,043 (49.79%) females. The major age group affected was adolescents and young adults. Conclusion: In Ecuador, pesticide poisoning occurs in individuals of both sexes who are between 15 to 25 years old and work in adverse conditions as agricultural farmers. The poisoning especially occurs in flower and banana plantation workers throughout the country. Seventy-one percent of the cases are due to organophosphate and carbamate poisonings, which cause death in 4% of the cases; 57% die in the first 48 h, possibly because of the acute action of AChE inhibitors.

Previous investigations have reported the apoptotic effects of azadirachtin on some insect cells, but the molecular mechanisms are still not clear. This study investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms for the apoptotic effects induced by azadirachtin on Drosophila melanogasterS2 cells in vitro.RESULTSThe results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay demonstrated that azadirachtin exhibited significant cytotoxicity to S2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The changes in cellular morphology and the DNA fragmentation demonstrated that azadirachtin induced remarkable apoptosis of S2 cells. Expression levels of 276 genes were found to be significantly changed in S2 cells after exposure to azadirachtin, as detected by Drosophila genome array. Among these genes, calmodulin (CaM) was the most highly upregulated gene. Azadirachtin was further demonstrated to trigger intracellular Ca2+ release in S2 cells. The genes related to the apoptosis pathway, determined from chip data, were validated by the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.CONCLUSIONThe results showed that azadirachtin-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release was the primary event that triggered apoptosis in Drosophila S2 cells through both pathways of the Ca2+-CaM and EcR/Usp signalling cascade.

Understanding these factors are critical to understand how to prevent exposure to pesticides and the subsequent neurotoxic effects. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",NA

It targets 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), whose lack in humans confers low toxicity to glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs). Nevertheless, its use is currently a debated topic. Several studies indicating toxicity are emerging, including associations between glyphosate and immune-endocrine disturbances. This chapter aims to describe the possible correlation between GBH exposure and immune-endocrine alterations. Data suggest that GBHs should be considered endocrine-disrupting compounds with effects on sex and thyroid hormones. Evidence of immune system alteration are fewer, but highlighted possible noxious effects on it, including lung inflammation, rhinitis, and celiac disease. An attractive hypothesis could be the one that connects microbiome dysbiosis, as several microorganisms express EPSPS and may be affected by glyphosate, and thus subsequent immune-endocrine alterations. Considering the wide use of GBHs, critical analyses are required to better characterize safety profile and possible health consequences of immune-endocrine alterations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R), and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA

They also are applied on the most prominent oil crops as desiccants in combination with pod sealants to prevent pod shatter and seed loss close to harvest. Even though these crops occupy a significant part of the world's agroecosystems, the effects of GLA herbicides on non-target arthropods, and in particular natural enemies of pests, have been studied very rarely, and such effects of pod sealants have never been studied. We studied in our laboratory mortality as well as prey capture efficiency of the common GLA herbicide and desiccant Basta 15((R)), pod sealant Arrest((R)), and a mixture of both on the wolf spider Pardosa agrestis. We found that Basta 15((R)) and the mixture had lethal effect on spiders. We also found significant, short-term effect on predatory activity of spiders after all treatments. Basta 15((R)) significantly influenced the amount of captured prey also in the long term. This is the first study showing lethal effect on spiders of the herbicide and herbicide plus pod sealant mixture. This is also the first study examining the effects of pod sealant on the mortality and predatory activity of a pest antagonist. More studies regarding the effects of agricultural chemical mixes are needed to uncover their effects on beneficial organisms existing within agroecosystems.",NA
"Zhu, Wanyi; Schmehl, Daniel R.; Mullin, Christopher A.; Frazier, James L.","Four Common Pesticides, Their Mixtures and a Formulation Solvent in the Hive Environment Have High Oral Toxicity to Honey Bee Larvae",2014,PLOS ONE,9,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0077547,"Recently, the widespread distribution of pesticides detected in the hive has raised serious concerns about pesticide exposure on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health. A larval rearing method was adapted to assess the chronic oral toxicity to honey bee larvae of the four most common pesticides detected in pollen and wax - fluvalinate, coumaphos, chlorothalonil, and chloropyrifos - tested alone and in all combinations. All pesticides at hive-residue levels triggered a significant increase in larval mortality compared to untreated larvae by over two fold, with a strong increase after 3 days of exposure. Among these four pesticides, honey bee larvae were most sensitive to chlorothalonil compared to adults. Synergistic toxicity was observed in the binary mixture of chlorothalonil with fluvalinate at the concentrations of 34 mg/L and 3 mg/L, respectively; whereas, when diluted by 10 fold, the interaction switched to antagonism. Chlorothalonil at 34 mg/L was also found to synergize the miticide coumaphos at 8 mg/L. The addition of coumaphos significantly reduced the toxicity of the fluvalinate and chlorothalonil mixture, the only significant non-additive effect in all tested ternary mixtures. We also tested the common 'inert' ingredient N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone at seven concentrations, and documented its high toxicity to larval bees. We have shown that chronic dietary exposure to a fungicide, pesticide mixtures, and a formulation solvent have the potential to impact honey bee populations, and warrants further investigation. We suggest that pesticide mixtures in pollen be evaluated by adding their toxicities together, until complete data on interactions can be accumulated.",NA

This is the first report of its kind.Subjects and methods This was an observational and retrospective study performed with data from 2001 to 2007 from the National Register of Hospital Admissions/Discharges from the Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos, and also with data from the Ministry of Public Health. Ecuador does not have an official public medical poisoning registry or disease-specific registries.Results The complete register reported 44,931 cases of poisoning with an average of 6,418 cases per year and a global progressive increase of 2,123 cases in the entire period. It reported 14,145 cases of pesticide poisoning. Of these, 10,100 cases were due to the effects of the insecticides organophospate and carbamate. The number of cases by gender was 7,102 (50.21%) males and 7,043 (49.79%) females. The major age group affected was adolescents and young adults.Conclusion In Ecuador, pesticide poisoning occurs in individuals of both sexes who are between 15 to 25 years old and work in adverse conditions as agricultural farmers. The poisoning especially occurs in flower and banana plantation workers throughout the country. Seventy-one percent of the cases are due to organophosphate and carbamate poisonings, which cause death in 4% of the cases; 57% die in the first 48 h, possibly because of the acute action of AChE inhibitors. The long-term effects of pesticides are still unclear and need further research.",NA

M.; Pereira, R.; Goncalves, F.",Ecotoxicological Effects of MIKADO (R) and VIPER (R) on Algae and Daphnids,2012,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY,27,685,699,10.1002/tox.20687,"The toxicity of single and combined formulated herbicides (Mikado (R) and Viper (R)) was assessed on several endpoints in species from two trophic levels: algae growth-Pseudokirchneriella sub-capitata and Chlorella vulgaris-immobilization and life-history traits (only for single compound toxicity) of daphnids-Daphnia longispina and Daphnia magna. Viper was the most toxic formulated herbicide. It was hypothesized that the toxicity of both formulated herbicides could have been enhanced by adjuvants, especially for Viper. In most cases, the sublethal endpoints were the most sensitive and affected by both formulations, comparatively to their acute effects. Concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) models provided an accurate description of Mikado and Viper joint action on algae growth and immobilization of daphnids, although significant deviations were always detected. A low-dose antagonism and high-dose synergism were identified for P. subcapitata, whereas C. vulgaris response deviated antagonistically from CA and synergistically from IA. For both daphnids, however, synergistic effects were observed for higher mixture concentrations. Under a regulatory standpoint, CA provided the most conservative estimation either because the mixture effects were overestimated or less subestimated than IA. Overall, the great sensitivity differences observed within species did not allow the conclusion that one trophic level was more tolerant than the other. Instead, P. subcapitata was always the most sensitive species to both herbicide formulations, followed by D. longispina, while D. magna and C. vulgaris were the most tolerant species. On a whole, further studies are needed toward a comprehensive understanding of herbicides mode of action, their effects at lower biological-level endpoints, and under different mixture designs.
